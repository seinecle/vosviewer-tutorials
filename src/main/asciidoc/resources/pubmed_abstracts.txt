Intranasal oxytocin (OT) affects a suite of human social behaviors, includingtrust, eye contact, and emotion recognition. However, it is unclear whereoxytocin receptors (OXTR) and the structurally related vasopressin 1a receptors(AVPR1a) are expressed in the human brain. We have previously described areliable, pharmacologically informed receptor autoradiography protocol forvisualizing these receptors in postmortem primate brain tissue. We used thistechnique in human brainstem tissue to identify the neural targets of OT andvasopressin. To determine binding selectivity of the OXTR radioligand and AVPR1a radioligand, sections were incubated in four conditions: radioligand alone,radioligand with the selective AVPR1a competitor SR49059, and radioligand with a low or high concentration of the selective OXTR competitor ALS-II-69. We foundselective OXTR binding in the spinal trigeminal nucleus, a conserved region ofOXTR expression in all primate species investigated to date. We found selectiveAVPR1a binding in the nucleus prepositus, an area implicated in eye gazestabilization. The tissue's postmortem interval (PMI) was not correlated witheither the specific or nonspecific binding of either radioligand, indicating thatit will not likely be a factor in similar postmortem studies. This study providescritical data for future studies of OXTR and AVPR1a in human brain tissue.Intranasal oxytocin (OT) affects a suite of human social behaviors, includingtrust, eye contact, and emotion recognition.

 Studying of the impact of social context on the perception of pain in others isimportant for understanding the role of intentionality in interpersonalsensitivity, empathy, and implicit moral reasoning. Here we used an event-relatedfMRI with pain and social context (i.e., the number of individuals in thestimuli) as the two factors to investigate how different social contexts andresulting perceived agency modulate the neural response to the perception of painin others. Twenty-six healthy participants were scanned while presented withshort dynamic visual stimuli depicting painful situations accidentally caused by or intentionally caused by another individual. The main effect of perception ofpain was associated with signal increase in the aMCC, insula, somatosensorycortex, SMA and PAG. Importantly, perceiving the presence of another individualled to specific hemodynamic increase in regions involved in representing socialinteraction and emotion regulation including the temporoparietal junction, medialprefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, and orbitofrontal cortex. Furthermore,the functional connectivity pattern between the left amygdala and other brainareas was modulated by the perceived agency. Our study demonstrates that thesocial context in which pain occurs modulate the brain response to other's pain. This modulation may reflect successful adaptation to potential danger present in a social interaction. Our results contribute to a better understanding of theneural mechanisms underpinning implicit moral reasoning that concern actions thatcan harm other people.
 The role of emotion in moral decision-making is still a matter of debate. Greene,Sommerville, Nystrom, Darley, and Cohen (2001) argue that 'personal' moraljudgments are driven by emotional responses, while 'impersonal' judgments arelargely driven by cognitive processes. In this study, oscillatory correlates ofdecision-making were compared in moral personal, moral impersonal, and nonmoralconditions, as well as in trials associated with utilitarian (i.e., favoring the 'greater good' over individual rights) and non-utilitarian choices. Event-relatedsynchronization in delta and theta bands was greater in the right temporal lobein personal than in both nonmoral and impersonal moral condition.Graph-theoretical analysis of connectivity patterns showed the prominent role of the orbitofrontal and cingulate cortices in personal moral decision-making,implying greater emotional and self-processing. Higher conscientiousness andintellect and lower behavioral activation were associated with greater differencein oscillatory responses between utilitarian and non-utilitarian choices inpersonal than in impersonal condition, indicating that sensitivity to moralissues and the ability to grasp the nuances of moral situation are essential for understanding the implications of utilitarian choices in personal and impersonal conditions.
 Decision neuroscience research, as currently practiced, employs the methods ofneuroscience to investigate concepts drawn from the social sciences. A typicalstudy selects one or more variables from psychological or economic models,manipulates or measures choices within a simplified choice task, and thenidentifies neural correlates. Using this "neuroeconomic" approach, researchershave described brain systems whose functioning shapes key economic variables,most notably aspects of subjective value. Yet, the standard approach hasfundamental limitations. Important aspects of the mechanisms of decision making -from the sources of variability in decision making to the very computationssupported by decision-related regions - remain incompletely understood. Here, Ioutline 10 outstanding challenges for future research in decision neuroscience.While some will be readily addressed using current methods, others will requirenew conceptual frameworks. Accordingly, a new strain of decision neurosciencewill marry methods from economics and cognitive science to concepts fromneurobiology and cognitive neuroscience.
 Results from recent functional neuroimaging studies suggest that facialexpressions of pain trigger empathic mimicry responses in the observer, in thesense of an activation in the pain matrix. However, pain itself also signals apotential threat in the environment and urges individuals to escape or avoid its source. This evolutionarily primitive aspect of pain processing, i.e., avoidance from the threat value of pain, seems to conflict with the emergence of empathicconcern, i.e., a motivation to approach toward the other. The present studyexplored whether the affective values of targets influence the detection of pain at the unconscious level. We found that the detection of pain was facilitated by unconscious negative affective processing rather than by positive affectiveprocessing. This suggests that detection of pain is primarily influenced by itsinherent threat value, and that empathy and empathic concern may not rely on asimple reflexive resonance as generally thought. The results of this studyprovide a deeper understanding of how fundamental the unconscious detection ofpain is to the processes involved in the experience of empathy and sympathy.
 The opiate system has long been implicated in the rewarding properties of social interactions. In particular, the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) mediates multiple formsof social attachment, including the attachment of offspring to the mother andsocial bonding between mates. We have previously shown that MOR in thecaudate-putamen is involved in partner preference formation in monogamous prairievoles. Here, using in situ hybridization and receptor autoradiography, we mapped in detail the distribution of MOR mRNA and ligand binding in monogamous prairievole brains and compared MOR binding density with that of promiscuous meadow volebrains. Comparison of MOR binding in these closely related species withdistinctly different social behavior revealed that while the distribution of MOR is similar, prairie voles have significantly higher densities of MOR than meadow voles in a majority of regions in the forebrain, including the caudate-putamen,nucleus accumbens shell, lateral septum and several thalamic nuclei, includingthe anteroventral and anteromedial thalamic nuclei. These differences in MORexpression between prairie and meadow voles could potentially contribute tospecies differences in behavior, including social attachment.
 Fairness violations elicit powerful behavioral and affective responses. Indeed,people are willing to incur costs to sanction unfair behavior. Here we study the possible impact of long-term mental training in socio-affective capacities suchas compassion on altruistic punishment and compensatory behavior in economicgames. To this end we recruited a group of long-term meditation practitioners(LTPs) who had engaged in an average of 40 K h of mental training exercisesincluding compassion-related meditation, along with a group of meditation-naivecontrols. Participants played several adaptations of the dictator game in whichthey had the opportunity to punish the dictator both when they were therecipients of the dictator's offer and when they were third-party witnesses tothe dictator's treatment of an anonymous second player. Compared to controls,LTPs were less likely to punish when they were the victims of fairnessviolations. However, both groups punished equivalently when they witnessed othersreceiving unfair treatment. In post-task questionnaires, controls reportedsignificantly more anger in response to unfair offers than LTPs, althoughfairness judgments did not differ between groups. These data suggest that becausethe LTPs were less angered by unfair treatment of themselves, they punished that behavior less. However, when they witnessed the unfair treatment of others, they engaged in norm-reinforcing punishment. Finally, when participants played anadditional game which included the opportunity to recompense victims, LTPs weremore likely to do so. Together these data point to differential approaches tojustice whereby LTPs engaged less in vengeful, retributive justice and focusedmore on norm reinforcement and the restoration of equity. These differencessuggest that social preferences are plastic and that altruistic responses tounfairness may be shaped by the prolonged cultivation of prosocial motivation,altruism, and compassion.
 BACKGROUND: Our knowledge with respect to psychological, endocrine, and neuralcorrelates of attentional bias in individuals with high vulnerability todeveloping depression - the subclinically depressed, still remains limited.DESIGN: The study used a 2 x 2 mixed design. METHODS: Attentional bias towardhappy and sad faces in healthy (N = 26) and subclinically depressed individuals(N = 22) was assessed via a neuroimaging dot-probe attention task. Participantsalso completed trait and state psychological measures and provided saliva samplesfor cortisol analysis. RESULTS: The subclinical group showed attentional biastoward happy faces; past use of problem-focused coping strategies when dealingwith a personally relevant stressor as well as state levels of anxiety, together,contributed to this bias. In the control group, the happy attentional bias waspositively correlated with activity in the right caudate. In the subclinicalgroup, the bias was negatively associated with the left fusiform gyrus andpositively with the left inferior parietal lobule and bilateral putamen. Weobserved group differences in association between cortisol levels during the taskand neural activity during happy attentional bias processing within the keyregions involved in attention. CONCLUSIONS: The attentional bias toward happyfaces may reflect an active coping attempt by the subclinical participants.
 Recent research has demonstrated impairments in social cognition associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). The present work asks whether these impairments areassociated with atypical moral judgment. Specifically, we assessed whether MSpatients are able to integrate information about intentions and outcomes formoral judgment (i.e., appropriateness and punishment judgments) in the case ofthird-party acts. We found a complex pattern of moral judgments in MS patients:although their moral judgments were comparable to controls' for specific types ofacts (e.g., accidental or intentional harms), they nevertheless judged behaviors to be less appropriate and endorsed more severe punishment across the board, and they were also more likely to report that others' responses would be congruentwith theirs. Further analyses suggested that elevated levels of externallyoriented cognition in MS (due to co-occurring alexithymia) explain these effects.Additionally, we found that the distinction between appropriateness andpunishment judgments, whereby harmful outcomes influence punishment judgments to a greater extent than appropriateness judgments, was preserved in MS despite the observed disruptions in the affective and motivational components of empathy. Thecurrent results inform the two-process model for intent-based moral judgments as well as possible strategies for improving the quality of life in MS patients.
 Oxytocin (OT) is a deeply conserved nonapeptide that acts both peripherally andcentrally to modulate reproductive physiology and sociosexual behavior acrossdivergent taxa, including humans. In vertebrates, the distribution of theoxytocin receptor (OTR) in the brain is variable within and across species, andOTR signaling is critical for a variety of species-typical social andreproductive behaviors, including affiliative and pair bonding behaviors inmultiple socially monogamous lineages of fishes, birds, and mammals. Early workin prairie voles suggested that the endogenous OT system modulates mating-inducedpartner preference formation in females but not males; however, there issignificant evidence that central OTRs may modulate pair bonding behavior in bothsexes. In addition, it remains unclear how transient windows of central OTRsignaling during sociosexual interaction modulate neural activity to produceenduring shifts in sociobehavioral phenotypes, including the formation ofselective social bonds. Here we re-examine the role of the central OT system inpartner preference formation in male prairie voles using a selective OTRantagonist delivered intracranially. We then use the same antagonist to examinehow central OTRs modulate behavior and immediate early gene (Fos) expression, ametric of neuronal activation, in males during brief sociosexual interaction witha female. Our results suggest that, as in females, OTR signaling is critical for partner preference formation in males and enhances correlated activation acrosssensory and reward processing brain areas during sociosexual interaction. Theseresults are consistent with the hypothesis that central OTR signaling facilitatessocial bond formation by coordinating activity across a pair bonding neuralnetwork.
 The transition from a relaxed to a drowsy state of mind is often accompanied byhypnagogic experiences: most commonly, perceptual imagery, but also linguisticintrusions, i.e., the sudden emergence of unpredictable anomalies in the streamof inner speech. This study has sought to describe the contents of suchintrusions, to verify their association with the progression of sleep onset, and to investigate the electroencephalographic processes associated with linguisticintrusions as opposed to more common hypnagogic perceptual imagery. A singleparticipant attended 10 experimental sessions in the EEG laboratory, where he wasallowed to drift into a drowsy state of mind, while maintaining metacognition of his own experiences. Once a linguistic intrusion or a noticeable perceptual imageoccurred, the participant pressed a button and reported it verbally. An increase in the EEG-defined depth of drowsiness as assessed by the Hori system of sleeponset was observed in the last 20 s before a button press. Likewise, EEGDimension of Activation values decreased before the button press, indicating thatthe occurrence of cognitively incongruous experiences coincides with the rapidchange of EEG predictability patterns. EEG hemispheric asymmetry analysis showed that linguistic intrusions had a higher alpha and gamma power in the lefthemisphere electrodes, whereas perceptual imagery reports were associated with a higher beta power over the right hemisphere. These findings indicate that themodality as well as the incongruence of drowsiness-related hypnagogic experiencesis strongly associated with distinct EEG signatures in this participant. Sleeponset may provide a unique possibility to study the neural mechanismsaccompanying the fragmentation of the stream of consciousness in healthyindividuals.
 The ultimatum game (UG) is an endowment sharing game in which a proposer suggestsa division of an asset to a recipient, who must accept or reject it. Economicstudies showed that despite recipients usually rejecting unfair offers,perception and reaction to unfairness are highly dependent on who is theproposer. Event-related potentials (ERPs) commonly detected in UG games are themedial frontal negativity (MFN), a component detected in recipients facing unfairoffers, and the P300, a component related to attentional and memory processes.Given this, we aimed to investigate the behavioral and ERP responses of healthypeople playing the UG game with Down syndrome (DS) and typical development (TD)proposers. Nineteen subjects participated in this study. The UG behavioral datawere similar to previous studies. ERP analysis showed no MFN in participantsfacing unfair offers. A higher P300 amplitude was detected when participantsfaced fair offers from TD compared to DS fair offers. We also found a positivecorrelation between P300 amplitude for TD offers and self-esteem scale score.Together these findings indicate that insertion of an atypical player in the UGled to changes in participants' perception and expectancy of the game.
 It is a well-established finding that memory encoding is impaired if an external secondary task (e.g. tone discrimination) is performed simultaneously. Yet, whilestudying we are also often engaged in internal secondary tasks such as planning, ruminating, or daydreaming. It remains unclear whether such a secondary internal task has similar effects on memory and what the neural mechanisms underlying suchan influence are. We therefore measured participants' blood oxygenation leveldependent responses while they learned word-pairs and simultaneously performeddifferent types of secondary tasks (i.e., internal, external, and control).Memory performance decreased in both internal and external secondary taskscompared to the easy control condition. However, while the external task reduced activity in memory-encoding related regions (hippocampus), the internal taskincreased neural activity in brain regions associated with self-reflection(anterior medial prefrontal cortex), as well as in regions associated withperformance monitoring and the perception of salience (anterior insula, dorsalanterior cingulate cortex). Resting-state functional connectivity analysesconfirmed that anterior medial prefrontal cortex and anterior insula/dorsalanterior cingulate cortex are part of the default mode network and saliencenetwork, respectively. In sum, a secondary internal task impairs memoryperformance just as a secondary external task, but operates through differentneural mechanisms.
 Discourse comprehension is a hallmark of human social behaviour and refers to theact of interpreting a written or spoken message by constructing mentalrepresentations that integrate incoming language with prior knowledge andexperience. Here, we report a human lesion study (n = 145) that investigates the neural mechanisms underlying discourse comprehension (measured by the DiscourseComprehension Test) and systematically examine its relation to a broad range ofpsychological factors, including psychometric intelligence (measured by theWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale), emotional intelligence (measured by theMayer, Salovey, Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test), and personality traits(measured by the Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness Personality Inventory). Scoresobtained from these factors were submitted to voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping to elucidate their neural substrates. Stepwise regression analyses revealed that working memory and extraversion reliably predict individual differences indiscourse comprehension: higher working memory scores and lower extraversionlevels predict better discourse comprehension performance. Lesion mapping resultsindicated that these convergent variables depend on a shared network of frontaland parietal regions, including white matter association tracts that bind theseareas into a coordinated system. The observed findings motivate an integrativeframework for understanding the neural foundations of discourse comprehension,suggesting that core elements of discourse processing emerge from a distributednetwork of brain regions that support specific competencies for executive andsocial function.
 Relational aggression is a type of aggression that aims to hurt others throughrelationships and includes behaviors such as gossip and ostracism. This type ofaggression is very common among adolescent girls, and in its more intense formshas been linked with poor psychosocial outcomes, including depression andsuicide. In the present study we investigated whether individual differences insensitivity to relational aggression among adolescent girls predicted recruitmentof neural networks associated with executive function and cognitive control.Neural response was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging duringan affect recognition task that included unfamiliar peer faces. A finding ofrelatively fewer reports of being victimized by relational aggression wasassociated with increased recruitment of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontalcortices as well as anterior and posterior cingulate cortices in response to the affect recognition task, as well as with greater competence on behavioralmeasures of executive function. Our results suggest that girls who are able torecruit specific frontal networks to improve cognitive and executive control are less sensitive to relational aggression.
 Recently, several behavioral sciences became increasingly interested ininvestigating biological and evolutionary foundations of (human) social behavior.In this light, prosocial behavior is seen as a core element of human nature. Acentral role within this perspective plays the "social brain" that is not onlyable to communicate with the environment but rather to interact directly withother brains via neuronal mind reading capacities such as empathy. From theperspective of a sociologist, this paper investigates what "social" means incontemporary behavioral and particularly brain sciences. It will be discussedwhat "social" means in the light of social neuroscience and a glance into thehistory of social psychology and the brain sciences will show that two thoughttraditions come together in social neuroscience, combining an individualistic andan evolutionary notion of the "social." The paper concludes by situating current research on prosocial behavior in broader social discourses about sociality andsociety, suggesting that to naturalize prosocial aspects in human life is acurrent trend in today's behavioral sciences and beyond.
 Because information about gender, kin, and social status are essential forreproduction and survival, it seems likely that specialized neural mechanismshave evolved to process social information. This review describes recent studies of four aspects of social information processing: (a) perception of socialsignals via the vomeronasal system, (b) formation of social memory via long-term filial imprinting and short-term recognition, (c) motivation for parentalbehavior and pair bonding, and (d) the neural consequences of social experience. Results from these studies and some recent functional imaging studies in humansubjects begin to define the circuitry of a "social brain." Suchneurodevelopmental disorders as autism and schizophrenia are characterized byabnormal social cognition and corresponding deficits in social behavior; thussocial neuroscience offers an important opportunity for translational researchwith an impact on public health.
 The human ability to perceive and understand others' suffering is critical toreinforcing and maintaining our social bonds. What is not clear, however, is the extent to which this generalizes to nonhuman entities. Anecdotal evidenceindicates that people may engage in empathy-like processes when observingsuffering nonhuman entities, but psychological research suggests that we morereadily empathize with those to whom we are closer and more similar. In thisresearch, we examined neural responses in participants while they were presented with pictures of human versus dog suffering. We found that viewing human andanimal suffering led to large overlapping regions of activation previouslyimplicated in empathic responding to suffering, including the anterior cingulate gyrus and anterior insula. Direct comparisons of viewing human and animalsuffering also revealed differences such that human suffering yieldedsignificantly greater medial prefrontal activation, consistent with high-leveltheory of mind, whereas animal suffering yielded significantly greater parietaland inferior frontal activation, consistent with more semantic evaluation andperceptual simulation.
 A recent paper famously accused the rising field of social neuroscience of using faulty statistics under the catchy title 'Voodoo Correlations in SocialNeuroscience'. This Special Issue invites us to take this claim as the startingpoint for a cross-cultural analysis: in which meaningful ways can recent researchin the burgeoning field of functional imaging be described as, contrasted with,or simply compared to animistic practices? And what light does such a readingshed on the dynamics and effectiveness of a century of brain research into highermental functions? Reviewing the heated debate from 2009 around recent trends inneuroimaging as a possible candidate for current instances of 'soul catching',the paper will then compare these forms of primarily image-based brain researchwith older regimes, revolving around the deciphering of the brain's electricalactivity. How has the move from a decoding paradigm to a representational regime affected the conceptualisation of self, psyche, mind and soul (if there still is such an entity)? And in what ways does modern technoscience provide new tools foranimating brains?
 Body postures provide clear signals about emotional expressions, but so far it isnot clear what muscle patterns are associated with specific emotions. This study lays the groundwork for a Body Action Coding System by investigating whatcombinations of muscles are used for emotional bodily expressions and assessingwhether these muscles also automatically respond to the perception of emotionalbehavior. Surface electromyography of muscles in the arms (biceps and triceps)and shoulders (upper trapezius and deltoids) were measured during both activeexpression and passive viewing of fearful and angry bodily expressions. Thebiceps, deltoids, and triceps are recruited strongly for the expression of anger and fear expression predominantly depends on the biceps and the deltoids. During passive viewing, all muscles automatically activate during the passive viewing ofanger. During fear perception, a clear activation can be seen in the trapezius,deltoid, and triceps muscles, whereas the biceps shows inhibition. In conclusion,this study provides more insight into the perception and expression of emotionsin the body.
 Recent studies have demonstrated neural overlap between resting state activityand self-referential processing. This "rest-self" overlap occurs especially inanterior cortical midline structures like the perigenual anterior cingulatecortex (PACC). However, the exact neurotemporal and biochemical mechanisms remainto be identified. Therefore, we conducted a combined electroencephalography(EEG)-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) study. EEG focused on pre-stimulus(e.g., prior to stimulus presentation or perception) power changes to assess the degree to which those changes can predict subjects' perception (and judgment) of subsequent stimuli as high or low self-related. MRS measured resting stateconcentration of glutamate, focusing on PACC. High pre-stimulus (e.g., prior tostimulus presentation or perception) alpha power significantly correlated withboth perception of stimuli judged to be highly self-related and with restingstate glutamate concentrations in the PACC. In sum, our results show (i)pre-stimulus (e.g., prior to stimulus presentation or perception) alpha power andresting state glutamate concentration to mediate rest-self overlap that (ii)dispose or incline subjects to assign high degrees of self-relatedness toperceptual stimuli.
 An important question in social neuroscience is the similarities and differences in the neural representations between the self and close others. Most studiesexamining this topic have identified the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) regionas the primary area involved in this process. However, several studies havereported conflicting data, making further investigation of this topic veryimportant. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, weinvestigated the brain activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) whenChinese participants passively listened to their self-name (SN), their mother'sname (MN), and unknown names (UN). The results showed that compared with UNrecognition, SN perception was associated with a robust activation in a widelydistributed bilateral network, including the cortical midline structure (the MPFCand ACC), the inferior frontal gyrus, and the middle temporal gyrus. The SNinvoked the bilateral superior temporal gyrus in contrast to the MN; the MNrecognition provoked a stronger activation in the central and posterior brainregions in contrast to the SN recognition. The SN and MN caused an activation of overlapping areas, namely, the ACC, MPFC, and superior frontal gyrus. Theseresults suggest that Chinese individuals utilize certain common brain region inprocessing both the SN and the MN. The present findings provide evidence for the neural basis of the self and close others for Chinese individuals.
 The successful navigation of social interactions depends on a range of cognitive faculties-including the ability to achieve joint attention with others to shareinformation and experiences. We investigated the influence that intentionmonitoring processes have on gaze-following response times during jointattention. We employed a virtual reality task in which 16 healthy adults engaged in a collaborative game with a virtual partner to locate a target in a visualarray. In the Search task, the virtual partner was programmed to engage innon-communicative gaze shifts in search of the target, establish eye contact, andthen display a communicative gaze shift to guide the participant to the target.In the NoSearch task, the virtual partner simply established eye contact and thenmade a single communicative gaze shift towards the target (i.e., there were nonon-communicative gaze shifts in search of the target). Thus, only the Searchtask required participants to monitor their partner's communicative intent beforeresponding to joint attention bids. We found that gaze following wassignificantly slower in the Search task than the NoSearch task. However, the sameeffect on response times was not observed when participants completed non-social control versions of the Search and NoSearch tasks, in which the avatar's gaze wasreplaced by arrow cues. These data demonstrate that the intention monitoringprocesses involved in differentiating communicative and non-communicative gazeshifts during the Search task had a measurable influence on subsequent jointattention behaviour. The empirical and methodological implications of thesefindings for the fields of autism and social neuroscience will be discussed.
 How do we make simple purchasing decisions (e.g., whether or not to buy a productat a given price)? Previous work has shown that the attentional drift-diffusionmodel (aDDM) can provide accurate quantitative descriptions of the psychometricdata for binary and trinary value-based choices, and of how the choice process isguided by visual attention. Here we extend the aDDM to the case of purchasingdecisions, and test it using an eye-tracking experiment. We find that the modelalso provides a reasonably accurate quantitative description of the relationship between choice, reaction time, and visual fixations using parameters that arevery similar to those that best fit the previous data. The only criticaldifference is that the choice biases induced by the fixations are about half asbig in purchasing decisions as in binary choices. This suggests that a similarcomputational process is used to make binary choices, trinary choices, and simplepurchasing decisions.
 Eyewitness testimony has been shown to be unreliable and susceptible to falsememories. Whether eyewitness memory errors are influenced by the victim's groupmembership (relative to both the eyewitness and perpetrator) is underexplored.The current study used complementary behavioral and neuroimaging approaches totest the hypothesis that intragroup conflict heightens participants'susceptibility to subsequent false memories. Healthy young adults witnessed andlater answered questions about events in which the perpetrator and victim wereeither 1) identified as in-group members relative to each other and theeyewitness, 2) out-group members relative to the eyewitness, but not each other, or 3) out-group members relative to each other (Experiments 1a and 1b). Whenperpetrators and victims were in-group members (intragroup conflict),participants showed heightened false memory rates. Moreover, false memoriesincreased upon crime realization. Neuroimaging data analysis revealed thatsalient (as compared to ambiguous) intragroup conflict elicited heightenedactivation in neural regions associated with resolving cognitive conflict(anterior cingulate cortex; ACC). Increased functional connectivity between theACC and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was associated with subsequent falsememories (Experiment 2). Results suggest that the social salience of theintragroup conflict may have been associated with participants' increasedsusceptibility to false memories.
 We are sensitive to valence intensity in negative emotional stimuli, but not inpositive emotional stimuli, a phenomenon known as the valence intensity effect.However, whether this valence intensity effect is processed similarly withindifferent negative stimuli, e.g., fear-inducing and disgust-inducing, remainsunclear. In the present study, we investigated whether the valence intensityeffects for fearful and disgusting stimuli were perceived in a unique way byusing event-related potentials (ERPs). Electroencephalogram was recorded from 22 participants as they performed a standard/deviant categorization task usingextremely disgusting pictures, moderately disgusting pictures, extremely fearful pictures, moderately fearful pictures, and neutral pictures. The ERP analysisrevealed that the extremely fearful stimuli elicited a larger amplitude N2 thanmoderately fearful stimuli, whereas the extremely disgusting stimuli elicited asmaller amplitude late positive component than moderately disgusting stimuli.This study is the first to provide evidence that fear and disgust may havedifferent valence intensity effects, which was revealed at early attentionallocation stages for fearful stimuli and at late emotional evaluation stages fordisgusting stimuli.
 The oxytocin system plays a prominent role in social behavior across species, andnumerous genetic studies in humans have reported associations betweenpolymorphisms on the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene and phenotypes related tosocial cognition, affiliation, perspective taking, and sociability in healthysubjects and in patients with atypical social behavior, such as in autismspectrum disorders (ASD). Recently, the first study demonstrating alteredagonist-induced OXTR internalization and recycling for the exonic variantrs35062132 emerged. Beside this, there has been no further demonstration of thefunctionality of the OXTR variants especially there does not exist any for theregulatory units. To address this gap in the literature, we tested thefunctionality of the promoter flanking single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)rs2268498, which has proven an interesting candidate for predicting socialbehavior in recent association studies. Results of genetic expression analyses inhuman hippocampal tissue showed a twofold difference in messenger RNAtranscription, dependent on the presence or absence of the C-allele. This findingwas corroborated by cloning, i.e., in vitro reporter gene expression analysisafter transfection of OXTR promoter plasmids into HEK-293 cells. Our resultsunderline the importance of OXTR rs2268498 for genetic research in socialbehavior and ASD.
 Age-related memory decline has been associated with a faulty regulation of thehypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis). The aim of this study was toinvestigate whether the magnitude of the stress-induced cortisol increase isrelated to memory performance when memory is measured in non-stressfulconditions. To do so, declarative and working memory performance were measured in31 men and 35 women between 55 and 77 years of age. On a different day, themagnitude of their cortisol response to acute psychosocial stress was measured.The relationship between the cortisol response and memory performance was Ushaped: a low cortisol response to stress was related to poorer declarative andworking memory performance, whereas those who did not increase their cortisollevels and those who had the largest cortisol increase had better declarative andworking memory capabilities. Sex did not moderate these relationships. Theseresults suggest that a low cortisol response to stress could reflect a defective HPA-axis response to stressors that is accompanied by poorer memory performance. Conversely, a high cortisol response seems to reflect a correct functioning ofthe HPA-axis and may protect against memory deficits in the later stages of humanlife.
 People base their decisions not only on their own self-interest but also on theinterests of close others. Generally, the personal self has primacy in themotivational hierarchy in the Western culture. A recent study found that friends have the same motivational hierarchy as the personal self in the Easterncollectivist culture. Remaining unknown is whether the motivational hierarchy of the personal self and close others can be manifested in the collectivist brain.In the present study, we asked participants to gamble for the personal self,close others (i.e., mother, father, and close friend), and strangers. Thepositive-going deflection of event-related potentials (ERPs) in response topositive feedback showed the following pattern: personal self = mother = father >friend > stranger. In the loss condition, no significant beneficiary effect wasobserved. The present results indicate that the personal self and parents areintertwined in the motivational system in the Chinese undergraduate studentbrain, supporting the view that the personal self and parents have the samemotivational primacy at the electrocortical level.
 According to the reverse simulation model of embodied simulation theory, werecognize others' emotions by subtly mimicking their expressions, which allows usto feel the corresponding emotion through facial feedback. Previous studiesexamining whether facial mimicry is necessary for facial expression recognitionwere limited by potentially distracting manipulations intended to artificiallyrestrict facial mimicry or very small samples of people with facial paralysis. Weaddressed these limitations by collecting the largest sample to date of peoplewith Moebius syndrome, a condition characterized by congenital bilateral facialparalysis. In this Internet-based study, 37 adults with Moebius syndrome and 37matched control participants completed a facial expression recognition task.People with Moebius syndrome did not differ from the control group or normativedata in emotion recognition accuracy, and accuracy was not related to extent ofability to produce facial expressions. Our results do not support the hypothesis that reverse simulation with facial mimicry is necessary for facial expressionrecognition.
 The present study sought to extend past research on frontal brain asymmetry andindividual differences by examining relationships of individual differences inbehavioral inhibition/approach system (BIS/BAS) sensitivity with asymmetricalfrontal event-related brain responses to startle probes presented during viewing of affective pictures. One hundred and ten participants were shown unpleasant,neutral, and pleasant affective pictures, and presented startle probes duringpicture presentations. Individual differences in BIS sensitivity related torelatively greater right frontal N100 amplitude to startle probes presentedduring pleasant and unpleasant pictures, whereas individual differences in BASsensitivity related to reduced left frontal P300 amplitude to startle probespresented during pleasant pictures. The results of this study suggest that BISsensitivity is related to greater relative right frontal cortical activity duringaffective states, while BAS sensitivity is related to greater relative leftfrontal cortical activity during appetitive states.
 A fundamental challenge facing social perceivers is identifying the causeunderlying other people's behavior. Evidence indicates that East Asian perceiversare more likely than Western perceivers to reference the social context whenattributing a cause to a target person's actions. One outstanding question iswhether this reflects a culture's influence on automatic or on controlledcomponents of causal attribution. After reviewing behavioral evidence thatculture can shape automatic mental processes as well as controlled reasoning, we discuss the evidence in favor of cultural differences in automatic and controlledcomponents of causal attribution more specifically. We contend that insightsemerging from social cognitive neuroscience research can inform this debate.After introducing an attribution framework popular among social neuroscientists, we consider findings relevant to the automaticity of attribution, beforespeculating how one could use a social neuroscience approach to clarify whetherculture affects automatic, controlled or both types of attribution processes.
 Deficits in decision-making are thought to contribute significantly tosocio-behavioral impairments of patients with frontal lobe damage. The purpose ofthis study was to test the hypothesis of whether the inappropriate socialbehavior of patients with frontal lesions can be viewed as the product of ageneral failure of decision-making ability or as the result of socio-cognitiveimpairment. We studied a group of patients with prefrontal lesions (FL patients, n = 15) and a group of matched healthy controls (n = 30) on the Iowa Gamblingtask (IGT) of nonsocial decision-making, environmental dependency phenomena (EDP)during social interaction, and the "reading the mind in the eyes" and "character intention task" of theory of mind (TOM) tasks. The FL patients were impaired inboth TOM and EDP protocols but, surprisingly, they behaved appropriately in theIGT. In addition, FL patients with EDP did not differ in executive functioning,IGT and TOM measures from those who did not demonstrate these behavioraldisorders. The right orbitofrontal cortex was associated with socialdecision-making deficits. By adopting an interactionist approach, this studyraises the possibility of identifying components of social and nonsocialdecision-making, which could be helpful in understanding the behavioral disordersof FL patients.
 To increase individual male fitness, males of various species remain near a(potential) mating partner and repel their rivals (mate-guarding). Mate-guarding is assumed to be mediated by two different types of motivation: sexual motivationtoward the opposite sex and competitive motivation toward the same sex. Thegenetic/molecular mechanisms underlying how mate presence affects malecompetitive motivation in a triadic relationship has remained largely unknown.Here we showed that male medaka fish prominently exhibit mate-guarding behavior. The presence of a female robustly triggers male-male competition for the femalein a triadic relationship (2 males and 1 female). The male-male competitionresulted in one male occupying a dominant position near the female whileinterfering with the other male's approach of the female. Paternity testingrevealed that the dominant male had a significantly higher mating success ratethan the other male in a triadic relationship. We next generated medaka mutantsof arginine-vasotocin (avt) and its receptors (V1a1, V1a2) and revealed that two genes, avt and V1a2, are required for normal mate-guarding behavior. In addition,behavioral analysis of courtship behaviors in a dyadic relationship andaggressive behaviors within a male group revealed that avt mutant males displayeddecreased sexual motivation but showed normal aggression. In contrast,heterozygote V1a2 mutant males displayed decreased aggression, but normalmate-guarding and courtship behavior. Thus, impaired mate-guarding in avt andV1a2 homozygote mutants may be due to the loss of sexual motivation toward theopposite sex, and not to the loss of competitive motivation toward rival males.The different behavioral phenotypes between avt, V1a2 heterozygote, and V1a2homozygote mutants suggest that there are redundant systems to activate V1a2 and that endogenous ligands activating the receptor may differ according to thesocial context.
 Cognitive models posit that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is maintained by biasedinformation-processing vis-a-vis threat of social exclusion. However, uncertaintystill abounds regarding the very nature of this sensitivity to social exclusionin SAD. Especially, brain alterations related to social exclusion have not beenexplored in SAD. Our primary purpose was thus to determine both the self-reportand neural correlates of social exclusion in this population. 23 patients withSAD and 23 matched nonanxious controls played a virtual game ("Cyberball") duringfMRI recording. Participants were first included by other players, then excluded,and finally re-included. At the behavioral level, patients with SAD exhibitedsignificantly higher levels of social exclusion feelings than nonanxiouscontrols. At the brain level, patients with SAD exhibited significantly higheractivation within the left inferior frontal gyrus relative to nonanxious controlsduring the re-inclusion phase. Moreover, self-report of social exclusioncorrelates with the activity of this cluster among individuals qualifying for SADdiagnosis. Our pattern of findings lends strong support to the notion that SADmay be better portrayed by a poor ability to recover following social exclusionthan during social exclusion per se. These findings value social neuroscience as an innovative procedure to gain new insight into the underlying mechanisms ofSAD.
 The neuropeptide arginine vasopressin (AVP) is known to modulate aggressivebehavior in mammals, but the neural mechanisms underlying this modulation are notclear yet. In the present study, we administered 20 IU AVP nasally in arandomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind manner to 36 healthy men using abetween-subjects design. After drug administration, participants performed acompetitive reaction time task (Taylor Aggression Paradigm, TAP) to elicitreactive aggressive behavior while functional magnetic resonance imaging wasrecorded. Under AVP treatment, we found increased activations in the rightsuperior temporal sulcus in the decision phase during trials in whichparticipants could get punished after losing the reaction time competition. Atthe behavioral level, no differences could be found between AVP treatment andplacebo condition. The lack of AVP-related behavioral effects is discussed interms of the general aggression model (GAM).
 The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is the most popular measure to evaluateimplicit attitudes. Nevertheless, its neural correlates are not yet fullyunderstood. We examined event related potentials (ERPs) in response to face- and word processing while indigenous and non-indigenous participants performed an IATdisplaying faces (ingroup and outgroup members) and words (positive and negative valence) as targets of category judgments. The N170 component was modulated byvalence of words and by ingroup/outgroup face categorization. Contextual effects (face-words implicitly associated in the task) had an influence on the N170amplitude modulation. On the one hand, in face categorization, right N170 showed differences according to the association between social categories of faces andaffective valence of words. On the other, in word categorization, left N170presented a similar modulation when the task implied a negative-valenceassociated with ingroup faces. Only indigenous participants showed a significant IAT effect and N170 differences. Our results demonstrate an early ERP blending ofstimuli processing with both intergroup and evaluative contexts, suggesting anintegration of contextual information related to intergroup attitudes during the early stages of word and face processing. To our knowledge, this is the firstreport of early ERPs during an ethnicity IAT, opening a new branch of exchangebetween social neuroscience and social psychology of attitudes.
 The amygdala has received intense recent attention from neuroscientistsinvestigating its function at the molecular, cellular, systems, cognitive, andclinical level. It clearly contributes to processing emotionally and sociallyrelevant information, yet a unifying description and computational account havebeen lacking. The difficulty of tying together the various studies stems in part from the sheer diversity of approaches and species studied, in part from theamygdala's inherent heterogeneity in terms of its component nuclei, and in partbecause different investigators have simply been interested in different topics. Yet, a synthesis now seems close at hand in combining new results from socialneuroscience with data from neuroeconomics and reward learning. The amygdalaprocesses a psychological stimulus dimension related to saliency or relevance;mechanisms have been identified to link it to processing unpredictability; andinsights from reward learning have situated it within a network of structuresthat include the prefrontal cortex and the ventral striatum in processing thecurrent value of stimuli. These aspects help to clarify the amygdala'scontributions to recognizing emotion from faces, to social behavior towardconspecifics, and to reward learning and instrumental behavior.
 In the present study we aimed to explore by means of repetitive transcranialmagnetic stimulation (rTMS) the reciprocal influences between prefrontal cortex(PFC) and premotor cortex (PMC). Subjects were asked to observe on a computermonitor different pictures representing manipulations of different kind of tools.They had to produce a movement (go condition) or to keep the resting position(no-go condition) at the appearance of different cue signals represented bydifferent colors shown alternatively on the hands manipulating the tools or onthe picture background. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were collected at theoffset of the visual stimuli before and after a 10 minute, 1 Hz rTMS trainapplied to the dorsolateral PFC (Experiment 1), to the PMC (Experiment 2) or tothe primary motor cortex (Experiment 3). Following rTMS to the PFC, MEPsincreased in the go condition when the cue for the go command was presented onthe hand. In contrast, following rTMS to the PMC, in the same condition, MEPswere decreased. rTMS to the primary motor cortex did not produce any modulation. Results are discussed according to the presence of a visual-motor matching systemin the PMC and to the role of the PFC in the attention-related processes. Wehypothesize that the perceptual analysis for action selection within the PFC was modulated by rTMS and its temporary functional inactivation in turn influencedthe premotor areas for motor programming.
 The aim of our study was to analyse decision making in early-onset Parkinson'sdisease (PD) patients performing the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). We compared 19patients with early-onset PD (</= 45 years) on dopaminergic medication (noevidence of depression, dementia, executive dysfunction according to the Tower ofLondon test and the Stroop test, or pathological gambling) with 20 age-matchedcontrols. A computer version of the IGT was employed. The PD patients achievedslightly lower IGT scores than the control group. A detailed analysis based on'shift frequencies' between the individual decks showed that the patients tended to change their preferences for the decks more frequently, with a higherpreference for the 'disadvantageous' deck B. Control subjects seemed to develop amore effective strategy. These differences could be caused by the poorer ability of the patients to develop any strategy at all. We observed changes in decisionmaking during IGT performance in patients with early-onset PD, although they had no executive dysfunction as measured by established neuropsychological tests. Themore detailed analysis employed in the present study could lead to a moreaccurate study of IGT performance and application of IGT in clinical practice.
 A recent study suggests that risk-taking decreases with age and that this may be related to dopamine-modulated changes in Pavlovian approach behavior, and not areduction in the subjective value of incremental rewards as traditional modelsfrom economics and psychology would have claimed.
 Twenty years ago, Baron-Cohen and colleagues argued that autistic performance on false belief tests was explained by a deficit in metarepresentation. Subsequentresearch moved from the view that the mind has a domain-general capacity formetarepresentation to the view that the mind has a domain-specific mechanism for metarepresentation of mental states per se, i.e., the theory of mind mechanism(ToMM). We argue that 20 years of data collection in lesion patients and childrenwith autism supports a more parsimonious view closer to that of the 1985 paper.Lower-level domain-specific mechanisms--e.g., tracking gaze, jointattention--interacting with higher-level domain-general mechanisms formetarepresentation, recursion, and executive function can account for observedpatterns of deficits in both autism and neurological patients. The performance ofchildren with autism or orbitofrontal patients on ToM tests can be explained moreparsimoniously by their deficits in lower-level domain-specific mechanisms forprocessing social information. Without proper inputs, the intact capacity formetarepresentation by itself cannot make correct ToM inferences. Children withautism have no impairment in false photograph tests because theirmetarepresentational capacity is intact and they have no impairment in inputsrequired for such tests. TPJ patients have equivalent deficits on ToM and non-ToMmetarepresentational tasks, consistent with a failure in domain-generalprocessing. If deficits on ToM tasks can result from deficits in low-level input systems or in higher-level domain-general capacities, postulating a separate ToM mechanism may have been an unnecessary theoretical move.
 The current study examined how specific neurological systems contribute to theexpression of multiple personality dimensions. We used individuals with traumaticbrain injuries to examine the contribution of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)--a region important for executive function and attention-to theexpression of neuroticism and conscientiousness factors and facets. Results from Voxel-Based Lesion-Symptom Mapping analyses revealed that focal damage to theleft DLPFC (Brodmann's area 9) was associated with high neuroticism and lowconscientious factor and facet scores (anxiety and self-discipline,respectively). Compared with lesioned and normal controls, veterans with damagein left DLPFC also reported higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness facet scores, slower reaction times on the California Computerized Assessment Packageassessment, and lower scores on the Delis-Kaplan executive function battery.Findings suggest that while neuroticism and conscientiousness remainpsychometrically independent personality dimensions, their component facets mayrely on a common neurocognitive infrastructure and executive function resourcesin general.
 Empathy is a core prerequisite for human social behavior. Relatively, little isknown about how empathy is influenced by social stress and its associatedneuroendocrine alterations. The current study was designed to test the impact of acute stress on emotional and cognitive empathy. Healthy male participants wereexposed to a psychosocial laboratory stressor (trier social stress test, (TSST)) or a well-matched control condition (Placebo-TSST). Afterwards they participated in an empathy test measuring emotional and cognitive empathy (multifacetedempathy test, (MET)). Stress exposure caused an increase in negative affect, arise in salivary alpha amylase and a rise in cortisol. Participants exposed tostress reported more emotional empathy in response to pictures displaying bothpositive and negative emotional social scenes. Cognitive empathy (emotionrecognition) in contrast did not differ between the stress and the control group.The current findings provide initial evidence for enhanced emotional empathyafter acute psychosocial stress.
 Experimental social neuroscience has shown that being socially excluded isprocessed in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We hypothesize that a chronicform of social exclusion resembling one aspect of social stigmatization isassociated with altered neural plasticity reflected by neurometabolic alterationsin the ACC. To test this hypothesis, a highly stigmatized patient group of heroinaddicts (N = 15) during opiate maintenance therapy rated a questionnaire aboutbeing stigmatized, and neurometabolic markers in the ACC were determined using(1)H MR spectroscopy. We found a negative correlation between discriminationexperience and N-acetylaspartate (NAA), indicating attenuated neuron functioning in the anterior cingulate cortex in those patients reporting high discrimination experience. Furthermore, perceived stigmatization showed an association withanxiety that was mediated by NAA. Although the correlative analysis cannot giveevidence for a causal relationship, the relation of NAA in the ACC anddiscrimination experience indicates a malfunction of the neural system involvedin cognitive control over emotionally relevant social stimuli in discriminationreporting heroin addicts. Further research is needed to elucidate factorsassociated with chronic stigmatization.
 Despite extensive research on the neural basis of empathic responses for pain anddisgust, there is limited data about the brain regions that underpin affectiveresponse to other people's emotional facial expressions. Here, we addressed this question using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to assessneural responses to emotional faces, combined with online ratings of subjectivestate. When instructed to rate their own affective response to others' faces,participants recruited anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate, inferiorfrontal gyrus, and amygdala, regions consistently implicated in studiesinvestigating empathy for disgust and pain, as well as emotional saliency.Importantly, responses in anterior insula and amygdala were modulated bytrial-by-trial variations in subjective affective responses to the emotionalfacial stimuli. Furthermore, overall task-elicited activations in these regionswere negatively associated with psychopathic personality traits, which arecharacterized by low affective empathy. Our findings suggest that anterior insulaand amygdala play important roles in the generation of affective internal states in response to others' emotional cues and that attenuated function in theseregions may underlie reduced empathy in individuals with high levels ofpsychopathic traits.
 In social environments, it is crucial that decision-makers take account of theimpact of their actions not only for oneself, but also on other social agents.Previous work has identified neural signals in the striatum encoding value-based prediction errors for outcomes to oneself; also, recent work suggests that neuralactivity in prefrontal cortex may similarly encode value-based prediction errors related to outcomes to others. However, prior work also indicates that socialvaluations are not isomorphic, with social value orientations of decision-makers ranging on a cooperative to competitive continuum; this variation has not beenexamined within social learning environments. Here, we combine a computationalmodel of learning with functional neuroimaging to examine how individualdifferences in orientation impact neural mechanisms underlying 'other-value'learning. Across four experimental conditions, reinforcement learning signals forother-value were identified in medial prefrontal cortex, and were distinct fromself-value learning signals identified in striatum. Critically, the magnitude anddirection of the other-value learning signal depended strongly on an individual'scooperative or competitive orientation toward others. These data indicate thatsocial decisions are guided by a social orientation-dependent learning systemthat is computationally similar but anatomically distinct from self-valuelearning. The sensitivity of the medial prefrontal learning signal to socialpreferences suggests a mechanism linking such preferences to biases in socialactions and highlights the importance of incorporating heterogeneous socialpredispositions in neurocomputational models of social behavior.
 Can social resilience be trained? We report results of a double-dissociativerandomized controlled study in which 48 Army platoons were randomly assigned tosocial resilience training (intervention condition) or cultural awarenesstraining (active control group). The same surveys were administered to allplatoons at baseline and after the completion of training to determine theshort-term training effects, generalization effects beyond training, and possibleadverse effects. Multilevel modeling analyses indicated that social resilience,compared with cultural awareness, training produced small but significantimprovements in social cognition (e.g., increased empathy, perspective taking, & military hardiness) and decreased loneliness, but no evidence was found forsocial resilience training to generalize beyond these training foci nor to haveadverse effects. Moreover, as predicted, cultural awareness, compared with socialresilience, training produced increases in knowledge about and decreases inprejudice toward Afghans. Additional research is warranted to determine thelong-term durability, safety, and generalizability of social resilience training.
 OBJECTIVES: While early onset of puberty among girls has been related tosubstance use involvement and other adverse outcomes, less research has examined pubertal development and outcomes in boys. Further, research on puberty has notbeen conducted in the context of other risk factors for substance use involvementsuch as impulsivity. To address these gaps, this study characterized boys'pubertal development from preadolescence to mid-adolescence and related it tosubstance use risk and behavioral impulsivity. METHODS: A sample of 153 boyscompleted the Pubertal Development Scale to assess perception of their pubertaldevelopment relative to same age peers from ages 10 to 16 years, at 6-monthintervals. Group-based trajectory modeling identified three distinct patterns of pubertal development: boys with more slowly developing boys with either earlier(n = 54) or later (n = 43) pubertal timing, and boys with faster tempo ofpubertal development (n = 56). The groups were compared on demographic andsubstance use risk characteristics, as well as behavioral measures ofimpulsivity. RESULTS: Boys who had the accelerated progression through pubertyhad the highest proportion of family histories of substance use disorder andperform more impulsively on reward choice measures. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes areconsistent within the Maturation Compression Hypothesis and social neurosciencemodels of adolescent developmental risk.
 Cognitive and biological processes play a role in human aggression. However,relatively little is known about the neural correlates of cognitive processes in aggressive individuals, particularly as they unfold during an aggressiveencounter. We investigated whether the P3 event-related potential (ERP)discriminates aggressive versus nonaggressive individuals during a provocative,aggressive encounter. Forty-eight participants (23 men and 25 women) wereclassified as aggressive or nonaggressive based on self-reported life history of aggression. Aggressive behavior was assessed using a modification of awell-validated laboratory task during which the participant and a fictitiousopponent ostensibly delivered and received noise blasts of low, medium, and high intensity. Provocation was manipulated by altering the level of noise set by the opponent. Aggression was defined as the number of high-intensity noise blasts theparticipant set for the opponent. As predicted, P3 amplitude in response toprovocation differed as a function of aggressive history. Nonaggressiveindividuals showed enhanced P3 when provoked by the opponent relative to lowprovocation, but this effect was absent in aggressive individuals. The resultssuggest that aggressive individuals engage fewer neural processing resources inresponse to provoking social cues, which may reflect aberrant cognitive andemotional processes.
 To survive in our complex environment, we have to adapt to changing contexts.Prior research that investigated how contextual changes are processed in thehuman brain has demonstrated important modulatory influences on multiplecognitive processes underlying decision-making, including perceptual judgments,working memory, as well as cognitive and attentional control. However, ineveryday life, the importance of context is even more obvious during economic andsocial interactions, which often have implicit rule sets that need to berecognized by a decision-maker. Here, we review recent evidence from anincreasing number of studies in the fields of Neuroeconomics and SocialNeuroscience that investigate the neurobiological basis of contextual effects on valuation and social choice. Contrary to the assumptions of rational choicetheory, multiple contextual factors, such as the availability of alternativechoice options, shifts in reference point, and social context, have been shown tomodulate behavior, as well as signals in task-relevant neural networks. Aconsistent picture that emerges from neurobiological results is thatvaluation-related activity in striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex ishighly context dependent during both social and nonsocial choice. Alternativeapproaches to model and explain choice behavior, such as comparison-based choice models, as well as implications for future research are discussed.
 A common modern view of consciousness is that it is an emergent property of thebrain, perhaps caused by neuronal complexity, and perhaps with no adaptive value.Exactly what emerges, how it emerges, and from what specific neuronal process, isin debate. One possible explanation of consciousness, proposed here, is that itis a construct of the social perceptual machinery. Humans have specializedneuronal machinery that allows us to be socially intelligent. The primary rolefor this machinery is to construct models of other people's minds thereby gainingsome ability to predict the behavior of other individuals. In the presenthypothesis, awareness is a perceptual reconstruction of attentional state; andthe machinery that computes information about other people's awareness is thesame machinery that computes information about our own awareness. The presentarticle brings together a variety of lines of evidence including experiments onthe neural basis of social perception, on hemispatial neglect, on the out-of-bodyexperience, on mirror neurons, and on the mechanisms of decision-making, toexplore the possibility that awareness is a construct of the social machinery in the brain.
 The "mere ownership effect" refers to individuals' tendency to evaluate objectsthey own more favorably than comparable objects they do not own. There arenumerous behavioral demonstrations of the mere ownership effect, but the neuralmechanisms underlying the expression of this self-positivity bias during theevaluation of self-associated objects have not been identified. The present studyaimed to identify the neurobiological expression of the mere ownership effect andto assess the potential influence of motivational context. During fMRI scanning, participants made evaluations of objects after ownership had been assigned under the presence or absence of self-esteem threat. In the absence of threat, the mereownership effect was associated with brain regions implicated in processingpersonal/affective significance and valence (ventromedial prefrontal cortex[vMPFC], ventral anterior cingulate cortex [vACC], and medial orbitofrontalcortex [mOFC]). In contrast, in the presence of threat, the mere ownership effectwas associated with brain regions implicated in selective/inhibitory cognitivecontrol processes (inferior frontal gyrus [IFG], middle frontal gyrus [MFG], and lateral orbitofrontal cortex [lOFC]). These findings indicate that depending onmotivational context, different neural mechanisms (and thus likely differentpsychological processes) support the behavioral expression of self-positivitybias directed toward objects that are associated with the self.
 In the course of the 1970s and 1980s, theories derived from neuropsychologicalresearch on the bisected brain came rapidly to achieve the status of common sensein the United States and Canada, inflecting all manner of popular and academicdiscussion. These theories often posited that the right hemisphere was the seatof creative expression, whereas the left hemisphere housed rationality andlanguage. This article analyzes the political and cultural implications oftheories about the split brain. Gender relations, educational reform, management theory, race relations, and countercultural concepts about self-expression allquickly came to be viewed through the lens of left-brain/right-brainneuropsychological research. Yet these theories were often contradictory. On the one hand, some psychophysiological experiments premised that the brain wasinherently plastic in nature, and thus self-improvement techniques (likemindfulness meditation) could be practiced to unfurl the right hemisphere'sintuitive potentialities. On the other hand, other psychophysiologicalexperiments concluded that Native Americans as well as African Americans andpersons from "the East" appeared inherently to possess more highly developedright-brain talents, and therefore suffered in the context of aleft-hemisphere-dominated Western society. In both instances, psychologists putneuroscientific research to political and social use. This article thus connects a story from the annals of the neurosciences to the history of psychologicalexperimentation. It analyzes the critical impact that speculative ideas about thesplit brain were to have not only on the post-1960s history of psychology butalso on what soon emerged after the 1990s as the social neuroscience revolution.

 Understanding the neural systems underpinning social cognition is a primary focusof contemporary social neuroscience. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study asked if brain activity reflecting socio-cognitiveprocesses differs between individuals according to their social behavior; namely,between a group of drivers with frequent traffic offenses and a group with none. Socio-cognitive processing was elicited by employing videos from a trafficawareness campaign, consisting of reckless and anti-social driving behaviorending in tragic consequences, and control videos with analogous driving themesbut without such catastrophic endings. We investigated whether relative increasesin brain function during the observation of these campaign stimuli compared with control videos differed between these two groups. To develop the results of ourprevious study we focused our analyses on superior temporal sulcus/gyrus(STS/STG). This revealed a bigger increase in brain activity within this regionduring the campaign stimuli in safe compared with dangerous drivers. Furthermore,by thematically coding drivers' verbal descriptions of the stimuli, we alsodemonstrate differences in STS reactivity according to drivers' scores on twoindices of socio-cognitive processing: subjects' perceived consequences ofactors' actions, and their affective evaluation of the clips. Our resultsdemonstrate the influence of social behavior and socio-cognitive processing onSTS reactivity to social stimuli, developing considerably our understanding ofthe role of this region in social cognition.
 A recent approach in social neuroscience has been the application of formalcomputational models for a particular social-cognitive process to neuroimagingdata. Here we review preliminary findings from this nascent subfield, focusing onobservational learning and strategic interactions. We present evidence consistentwith the existence of three distinct learning systems that may contribute tosocial cognition: an observational-reward-learning system involved in updatingexpectations of future reward based on observing rewards obtained by others, anaction-observational learning system involved in learning about the actiontendencies of others, and a third system engaged when it is necessary to learnabout the hidden mental-states or traits of another. These three systems appearto map onto distinct neuroanatomical substrates, and depend on uniquecomputational signals.
 OBJECTIVE: Childhood maltreatment leads to neuroendocrine changes, which may beassociated with an increased vulnerability for psychopathology, such asdepression and anxiety in later life. This study aimed to investigate therelationship between childhood maltreatment and orexin A levels in patients with depression and anxiety. The study consisted of 27 female outpatients whopresented with depressive and/or anxiety symptoms, and 27 healthy femalecontrols. Childhood trauma history was assessed using the childhood traumaquestionnaire (CTQ-28) in patients and controls. Serum levels of orexin andcortisol were measured in all subjects. There were positive correlations between serum orexin levels and CTQ total score and between orexin levels and some CTQsubscale scores, such as physical and emotional neglect, in patients. Orexinlevels in patients with a positive history of physical and emotional neglect werehigher than those in patients with a negative history of them. In the controls,there was a positive correlation between emotional neglect score and serum orexinlevel. There were no differences in serum levels of orexin and cortisol betweenpatients and controls. Orexin levels may be associated with childhoodmaltreatment per se, rather than psychopathology, such as depression or anxiety.
 Alien control phenomena are symptoms reported by patients with schizophreniawhereby feelings of control and ownership of thoughts and movements are lost.Comparable alien control experiences occur in culturally influenced dissociative states. We used fMRI and suggestions for automatic writing in highly hypnoticallysuggestible individuals to investigate the neural underpinnings of alien control.Targeted suggestions selectively reduced subjective ratings of control andownership for both thought and movement. Thought insertion (TI) was associatedwith reduced activation of networks supporting language, movement, andself-related processing. In contrast, alien control of writing movement wasassociated with increased activity of a left-lateralised cerebellar-parietalnetwork and decreased activity in brain regions involved in voluntary movement,including sensory-motor hand areas and the thalamus. Both experiences involved a reduction in activity of left supplementary motor area (SMA) and were associated with altered functional connectivity (FC) between SMA and brain regions involved in language processing and movement implementation. Collectively these resultsindicate the SMA plays a central role in alien control phenomena as a high level executive system involved in the sense that we control and own our thoughts andmovements.
 Intergroup bias-the tendency to behave more positively toward an ingroup memberthan an outgroup member-is a powerful social force, for good and ill. Although itis widely demonstrated, intergroup bias is not universal, as it is characterized by significant individual differences. Recently, attention has begun to turn towhether neuroanatomy might explain these individual differences in intergroupbias. However, no research to date has examined whether white mattermicrostructure could help determine differences in behavior toward ingroup andoutgroup members. In the current research, we examine intergroup bias with thethird-party punishment paradigm and white matter integrity and connectivitystrength as determined by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We found that bothincreased white matter integrity at the right temporal-parietal junction (TPJ)and connectivity strength between the right TPJ and the dorsomedial prefrontalcortex (DMPFC) were associated with increased impartiality in the third-partypunishment paradigm, i.e., reduced intergroup bias. Further, consistent with the role that these brain regions play in the mentalizing network, we found thatthese effects were mediated by mentalizing processes. Participants with greaterwhite matter integrity at the right TPJ and connectivity strength between theright TPJ and the DMPFC employed mentalizing processes more equally for ingroupand outgroup members, and this non-biased use of mentalizing was associated with increased impartiality. The current results help shed light on the mechanisms of bias and, potentially, on interventions that promote impartiality over intergroupbias.
 Understanding how option values are compared when making a choice is a keyobjective for decision neuroscience. In natural situations, agents may have apriori on their preferences that create default policies and shape the neuralcomparison process. We asked participants to make choices between items belongingto different categories (e.g., jazz vs. rock music). Behavioral data confirmedthat the items taken from the preferred category were chosen more often and more rapidly, which qualified them as default options. FMRI data showed that baseline activity in classical brain valuation regions, such as the ventromedialPrefrontal Cortex (vmPFC), reflected the strength of prior preferences. Inaddition, evoked activity in the same regions scaled with the default optionvalue, irrespective of the eventual choice. We therefore suggest that in thebrain valuation system, choices are framed as comparisons between default andalternative options, which might save some resource but induce a decision bias.
 Throughout the social work profession, there is ongoing interest in building asocial science agenda that can address the complex practice-based questions facedby social work professionals today. Methodological innovations and unique fundingopportunities have already significantly advanced research on social workpractice. Still, there is enthusiastic discussion of how to ensure that suchcapacity development helps the profession move forward in ways that make use ofthe biological sciences and that facilitate social work-specific contributions tothe larger interdisciplinary scientific community. This article describes how thesocial work profession can make use of biomedical knowledge and technologicaladvances from social neuroscience to inform psychosocial treatment development,and it illustrates an application to social work practice by giving an example ofa substance abuse treatment development process built on social neuroscientificresearch.
 Previous studies indicated that oxytocin plays an important role in human trust, which is impaired in patients with severe mental disorders. In this study, wemeasured plasma oxytocin levels in patients with schizophrenia (n=50) and inhealthy controls (n=50) after neutral and trust-related interpersonalinteractions. Trust-related interactions were associated with increased oxytocin levels in controls. This effect was absent in patients with schizophrenia. Lowoxytocin levels measured after trust-related interactions significantly predictedthe negative symptoms of schizophrenia but were not related to positive symptoms,depression, anxiety, and neuropsychological functions. These results suggest thatdecreased trust-related oxytocin release is related to the negative symptoms and may be associated with social withdrawal, isolation, and flattened affect inschizophrenia.
 Anxiety disorders represent a common but often debilitating form ofpsychopathology in both children and adults. While there is a growingunderstanding of the etiology and maintenance of these disorders across variousresearch domains, only recently have integrative accounts been proposed. Whileclassical attachment history has been a traditional core construct inpsychological models of anxiety, contemporary attachment theory has the potentialto integrate neurobiological and behavioral findings within a multidisciplinarydevelopmental framework. The current paper proposes a modern attachmenttheory-based developmental model grounded in relevant literature from multipledisciplines including social neuroscience, genetics, neuroendocrinology, and the study of family factors involved in the development of anxiety disorders. Recent accounts of stress regulation have highlighted the interplay between stress,anxiety, and activation of the attachment system. This interplay directly affectsthe development of social-cognitive and mentalizing capacities that are acquired in the interpersonal context of early attachment relationships. Early attachment experiences are conceptualized as the key organizer of a complex interplaybetween genetic, environmental, and epigenetic contributions to the developmentof anxiety disorders - a multifactorial etiology resulting from dysfunctionalco-regulation of fear and stress states. These risk-conferring processes arecharacterized by hyperactivation strategies in the face of anxiety. Thecumulative allostatic load and subsequent "wear and tear" effects associated withhyperactivation strategies converge on the neural pathways of anxiety and stress.Attachment experiences further influence the development of anxiety as potential moderators of risk factors, differentially impacting on genetic vulnerability andrelevant neurobiological pathways. Implications for further research andpotential treatments are outlined.
 The social neuroscience of child and adolescent depression is inherentlymultidisciplinary. Depressive disorders beginning early in life can have serious developmental and functional consequences. Psychopathology research has describeddepression's defining clinical and contextual features, and intervention researchhas characterized its response to treatment and prevention programs.Neuroendocrine, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging studies have identifiedcore neurobiological aspects of early-onset mood disorders. These areas arereviewed using a developmental social neuroscience perspective for integratingdisparate observations. The paper introduces a dynamic adaptive systemsframework, and it discusses hedonic capacity, stress sensitivity, ruminativeself-focus, and attentional impairments as fundamental components of mooddisorders.
 Cognitive neuroscience has made considerable progress in understanding the neuralarchitecture of human intelligence, identifying a broadly distributed network of frontal and parietal regions that support goal-directed, intelligent behavior.However, the contributions of this network to social and emotional aspects ofintellectual function remain to be well characterized. Here we investigated theneural basis of emotional intelligence in 152 patients with focal brain injuries using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. Latent variable modeling was applied toobtain measures of emotional intelligence, general intelligence and personalityfrom the Mayer, Salovey, Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT), theWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and the Neuroticism-Extroversion-OpennessInventory, respectively. Regression analyses revealed that latent scores formeasures of general intelligence and personality reliably predicted latent scoresfor emotional intelligence. Lesion mapping results further indicated that theseconvergent processes depend on a shared network of frontal, temporal and parietalbrain regions. The results support an integrative framework for understanding thearchitecture of executive, social and emotional processes and make specificrecommendations for the interpretation and application of the MSCEIT to the studyof emotional intelligence in health and disease.
 Pretend play emerges in children the world over around 18 months and continuesinto adolescence and even adulthood. Observing and engaging in pretense arethought to rely on similar neural mechanisms, but little is known about them.Here we examined neural activation patterns associated with observing pretenseacts, including high-likelihood, low-likelihood, and imaginary substituteobjects, as compared with activation patterns when observing parallel real acts. The association between fantasy predisposition and cortical representations ofpretense was also explored. Supporting prior research that used more limitedtypes of pretense, observed pretense acts, when contrasted with real acts,elicited activity in regions associated with mentalizing. A novel contributionhere is that substitute object pretense (high- and low-likelihood) elicitedsignificantly more activity than imaginary (pantomime) acts not only in theory ofmind regions but also in the superior parietal lobule, a region thought to aid inthe prediction and error-monitoring of motor actions. Finally, whenhigh-likelihood pretense acts were contrasted with real acts, participants withelevated fantasy predispositions evidenced significantly different activationpatterns than their more reality-prone peers. Future research will explore theintersection of fantasy predisposition and experience with the neuralrepresentation of pretense.
 Generalized Social Phobia (GSP) is a common anxiety disorder that produces clear social life disruptions. There is no consensus on the specific processes involvedin its development, but the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axishas been suggested. This study analyzed the effects of the cortisol response tothe Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) on the memory retrieval of pictures withdifferent emotional valences in 45 non-treated young students with GSP and 50non-anxious (NA) subjects (mean=19.35years, SD=0.18). No differences were foundin the cortisol response of GSP and NA subjects to the TSST and control sessions.In addition, psychosocial stress impaired memory retrieval in both the GSP and NAgroups, with no differences between them. Regarding the sex factor, no effectswere found in the cortisol response to the TSST. However, during the encodingsession, GSP men had higher cortisol levels than GSP women and NA subjects. Therewas also a significant interaction between sex and stress exposure on memoryretrieval. Women recognized more unpleasant and neutral pictures than men;however, under stress, the women's advantage disappeared, and the men'sperformance improved. Sex also interacted with social phobia on positive mood,with GSP women exposed to the TSST showing the lowest positive mood. Theseresults suggest that GSP subjects do not present an HPA axis sensitization topsychosocial stress, and they emphasize the importance of Sex in understandingstress effects on memory.
 BACKGROUND: Reciprocal social behavior (RSB) is a developmental prerequisite for social competency, and deficits in RSB constitute a core feature of autismspectrum disorder (ASD). Although clinical screeners categorically ascertain riskof ASD in early childhood, rapid methods for quantitative measurement of RSB intoddlers are not yet established. Such measurements are critical for trackingdevelopmental trajectories and incremental responses to intervention. METHODS: Wedeveloped and validated a 20-min video-referenced rating scale, thevideo-referenced rating of reciprocal social behavior (vrRSB), for untrainedcaregivers to provide standardized ratings of quantitative variation in RSB.Parents of 252 toddler twins [Monozygotic (MZ) = 31 pairs, Dizygotic (DZ) = 95pairs] ascertained through birth records, rated their twins' RSB at two timepoints, on average 6 months apart, and completed two developmental measures, the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) and the MacArthurCommunicative Development Inventory Short Form (MCDI-s). RESULTS: Scores on thevrRSB were fully continuously distributed, with excellent 6-month test-retestreliability ([intraclass correlation coefficient] ICC = 0.704, p < .000). MZtwins displayed markedly greater trait concordance than DZ twins, (MZ ICC =0.863, p < .000, DZ ICC = 0.231, p < .012). VrRSB score distributions were highlydistinct for children passing versus failing the M-CHAT (t = -8.588, df = 31, p <.000), incrementally improved from 18-24 months, and were inversely correlatedwith receptive and expressive vocabulary on the MCDI-s. CONCLUSIONS: Likequantitative autistic trait ratings in school-aged children and adults, toddlerscores on the vrRSB are continuously distributed and appear highly heritable.These ratings exhibited minimal measurement error, high inter-individualstability, and developmental progression in RSB as children matured from 18-24months, supporting their potential utility for serially quantifying the severity of early autistic syndromes over time and in response to intervention. Inaddition, these findings inform the genetic-environmental structure of RSB inearly typical development.
 Social status is a key regulator of health and reproduction in mammals, includinghumans. Despite this, relatively little is known about how social statusinfluences the mammalian brain. Furthermore, the extent to which status is anindependent construct, i.e., not simply acting as a psychosocial stressor, is yetto be determined. Research to date reveals several promising mechanisms and/orsystems associated with social status, including monoamine systems, hypothalamic neuroendocrine axes, and the hippocampus, though whether these differences arethe cause or effect of status is often unclear. We review these candidates andpropose how best to approach this research question in the future.
 How can we reconcile the conception of language as a conventional-normativesemiotic system with a perception/action-based account of its structure andmeaning? And why should linguistic meaning--as opposed to linguisticexpression--be so closely related to motor activity and its neural underpinnings,as suggested by recent findings? A conceptual framework and evolutionary scenariobuilding on the concept of bodily mimesis [Zlatev, J., 2005. What's in a schema? Bodily mimesis and the grounding of language. In: Hampe, B. (Ed.), FromPerception to Meaning: Image Schemas in Cognitive Linguistics. Mouton de Gruyter,Berlin, pp. 313-343] imply answers to these questions. The article presentsevidence for a particular evolutionary stage model by reviewing recent evidenceon the capacity of non-human primates for intersubjectivity, imitation andgestural communication, and from neuroscientific studies of these capacities inmonkeys and human subjects. It is argued that "mirror neuron" systems cansubserve basic motoric and social capacities, but they need to be considerablyextended in order to provide an efficient basis for bodily mimesis, and even moreso for language. It is argued that while language may be ultimately "grounded" inperception and action, it is essential not to try to reduce it to them.
 The Trust Game has been increasingly used in the emerging field of neuroeconomicsto study brain mechanisms underlying decision-making in social interactions with financial outcomes. In this review, we attempt to concisely describe mainneuroscience findings in the context of this game, with a special emphasis on theparameters potentially influencing the results. Factors modulating trust when thesubject plays the part of the Investor are clustered into a few major categories:the Trustee, the administration of the game (single-shot or repeatedinteractions), the impact of hormones and genetics, inter-individual differences,time and other experimental settings. The few studies focusing on the Trustee arethen briefly summarized, drawing again the attention of the future experimenteron possible pitfalls as well as offering some interpretation keys to the readerfacing divergent results.
 A recent trend in decision neuroscience is the use of model-based fMRI usingmathematical models of cognitive processes. However, most previous model-basedfMRI studies have ignored individual differences due to the challenge ofobtaining reliable parameter estimates for individual participants. Meanwhile,previous cognitive science studies have demonstrated that hierarchical Bayesiananalysis is useful for obtaining reliable parameter estimates in cognitive modelswhile allowing for individual differences. Here we demonstrate the application ofhierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation to model-based fMRI using the example of decision making in the Iowa Gambling Task. First we use a simulation study to demonstrate that hierarchical Bayesian analysis outperforms conventional(individual- or group-level) maximum likelihood estimation in recovering trueparameters. Then we perform model-based fMRI analyses on experimental data toexamine how the fMRI results depend upon the estimation method.
 It is suggested that acute stress shifts behavioral control from goal-directed,model-based toward habitual, model-free strategies. Recent findings indicate thatinterindividual differences in the cortisol stress response influence model-baseddecision-making. Although not yet investigated in humans, animal studies showthat chronic stress also shifts decision-making toward more habitual behavior.Here, we ask whether acute stress and individual vulnerability factors, such asstress reactivity and previous exposure to stressful life events, impact thebalance between model-free and model-based control systems. To test this, 39 maleparticipants (21-30 years old) were exposed to a potent psychosocial stressor(Trier Social Stress Test) and a control condition in a within-subjects designbefore they performed a sequential decision-making task which evaluates thebalance between the two systems. Physiological and subjective stress reactivitywas assessed before, during, and after acute stress exposure. By means ofcomputational modeling, we demonstrate that interindividual variability in stressreactivity predicts impairments in model-based decision-making. Whereas acutepsychosocial stress did not alter model-based behavioral control, we foundchronic and acute stress to interact in their detrimental effect ondecision-making: subjects with high but not low chronic stress levels asindicated by stressful life events exhibited reduced model-based control inresponse to acute psychosocial stress. These findings emphasize that stressreactivity and chronic stress play an important role in mediating therelationship between stress and decision-making. Our results might stimulate new insights into the interplay between chronic and acute stress, attenuatedmodel-based control, and the pathogenesis of various psychiatric diseases.
 In the social neuroscience of face processing, multiple roles are attributed toamygdala: signalling of fear/threat-stimuli, of emotional expression, and generalsalience. The current study aimed at a direct comparison of amygdala activationattributable to these conditions by contrasting amygdala responses to matchedemotional (threatening and non-threatening) and of non-emotional salient faces ina visual search paradigm using cartoon faces. Participants (21 healthyvolunteers) had to detect a target face (angry, happy, blue, red, differing inthe exact same features) in an array of closely matched non-target faces.Behavioural results revealed a pop-out effect for all targets compared tonon-targets, indicating that they were all salient, independently of beingemotional or non-emotional. While significant amygdala activation was obtainedfor all trials with salient faces (compared to those containing only non-targetfaces), no significant differences in activation emerged between emotionalthreatening, emotional non-threatening, and non-emotional targets. Moreover,right and left amygdala activation for target trials was found correlated to the behavioural measure of target detection. These findings provide evidence for ageneral role of the amygdala in signalling salience in a visual searchindependent of modality. Given the critical involvement of the amygdala inseveral neuropsychiatric disorders, the current findings may contribute tofurther our understanding on dysfunctional neural circuits in these disorders.
 In the following article we present a view that social cognition and socialneuroscience, as shaped by the current research paradigms, are not sufficient to improve our understanding of psychopathological phenomena. We hold that the self,self-awareness, and inter-subjectivity are integral to social perception andactions. In addition, we emphasize that the self and self-awareness are, by theirvery nature and function, involved over the entire lifespan with the way theindividual is perceived in the social environment. Likewise, the modes ofoperation and identification of the self and self-awareness receive strongdevelopmental contributions from social interactions with parental figures,siblings, peers, and significant others. These contributions are framed by acompetitive and cooperative struggle for love and recognition. We suggest that inhumans social cognitive neuroscience should be informed by a thoughtfulappreciation of the equal significance of the struggle for "life" and that forlove and recognition. In order to be better positioned to improve the researchagenda and practice of clinical psychiatry, we propose that cognitive and social neurosciences explicitly incorporate in their models phenomena relative to theself, self-awareness, and inter-subjectivity.
 Anxiety plays an important role in social behavior. For instance, high-anxiousindividuals are more likely to avoid such social interactions as communicatingwith strangers. In this study, we investigate the impact of anxiety on socialdecision-making. The classic ultimatum game (UG) paradigm was utilized in concertwith skin conductance recording. Behavioral results reveal that when playing asresponders, high-trait anxiety (HTA) participants with lower levels ofself-esteem, as well as low-trait anxiety (LTA) participants with higher levelsof impulsivity, were more likely to accept human-proposed inequitable offers. In addition, the HTA participants rejected more computer-proposed inequitable offersthan did LTA participants. Moreover, the skin conductance response to inequitableoffers was correlated with levels of anxiety in the HTA group, but not in the LTAgroup. In conclusion, people differing in levels of anxiety showed distinctbehavior patterns and autonomic neural responses during social decision-making,whereas the levels of self-esteem, impulsivity, and depression might beadditional moderating factors. These findings contextualize high-anxious people'savoidance tendency in social interaction.
 Although considerable research has shown the importance of social connection for physical health, little is known about the higher-level neurocognitive processes that link experiences of social connection or disconnection with health-relevant physiological responses. Here we review the key physiological systems implicated in the link between social ties and health and the neural mechanisms that maytranslate social experiences into downstream health-relevant physiologicalresponses. Specifically, we suggest that threats to social connection may tapinto the same neural and physiological 'alarm system' that responds to othercritical survival threats, such as the threat or experience of physical harm.Similarly, experiences of social connection may tap into basic reward-relatedmechanisms that have inhibitory relationships with threat-related responding.Indeed, the neurocognitive correlates of social disconnection and connection may be important mediators for understanding the relationships between social tiesand health.
 BACKGROUND: The Interpersonal Attention Management Inventory (IAMI) represents a new instrument to capture self- and external perception skills. The underlyingtheoretical model assumes 3 mental locations of attention (the intrapersonalspace, the extrapersonal space, and the external intrapersonal space) of theother. METHODS: The IAMI was studied regarding its factor structure; it wasshortened and statistical values as well as first reference values werecalculated based on a larger sample (n = 1089). RESULTS: By factor analysis, the superordinate scales could be widely validated. The shortened version with 31items and 3 superordinate scales shows a high reliability of the global value(Cronbach's alpha = 0.81) and, regarding the convergent validity, a modestcorrelation (r = 0.41) of the global value and mindfulness, measured with theFreiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI). CONCLUSIONS: Further validation studies areinvited so that the IAMI can be used as an instrument for (course) diagnosis inthe therapy of psychiatric disorders as well as for research in socialneuroscience, e.g., in investigations on mindfulness, compassion, empathy, theoryof mind, and self-boundaries.
 Although lesional, neuroimaging, and brain stimulation studies have provided aninsight into the neural mechanisms of judgement and decision-making, all theseworks focused on the cerebral cortex, without investigating the role ofsubcortical structures such as the basal ganglia. Besides being an effectivetherapeutic tool, deep brain stimulation (DBS) allows local field potential (LFP)recordings through the stimulation electrodes thus providing a physiological"window" on human subcortical structures. In this study we assessed whethersubthalamic nucleus LFP oscillations are modulated by processing of moralconflictual, moral nonconflictual, and neutral statements. To do so, in 16patients with Parkinson's disease (8 men) bilaterally implanted with subthalamic nucleus (STN) electrodes for DBS, we recorded STN LFPs 4 days after surgeryduring a moral decision task. During the task, recordings from the STN showedchanges in LFP oscillations. Whereas the 14--30 Hz band (beta) changed during themovement executed to perform the task, the 5--13 Hz band (low-frequency) changed when subjects evaluated the content of statements. Low-frequency band powerincreased significantly more during conflictual than during nonconflictual orneutral sentences. We conclude that STN responds specifically to conflictualmoral stimuli, and could be involved in conflictual decisions of all kinds, notonly those for moral judgment. LFP oscillations provide novel direct evidencethat the neural processing of conflictual decision-making spreads beyond thecortex to the basal ganglia and encompasses a specific subcorticalconflict-dependent component.
 Studies in a variety of species have reported enhanced prosocial effects after anacute administration of the neuromodulating hormone, oxytocin (OT). Although the exact mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully understood, there isbroad interest in developing OT into a treatment for social deficits. Only a few studies, however, have examined the effects of OT if given repeatedly duringearly development, the period when early intervention is likely to have thegreatest benefits for reversing the progression towards social impairment. Those studies, exclusively in rodents, report mixed results. Some have shownenhancement of prosocial behavior, including increased social exploration, butothers have shown anti-social effects, including increased aggression. In thepresent study, infant rhesus macaques were treated with a high-frequency (3x per week) or low-frequency (1x per week) dose of intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) orplacebo (IN-saline) between two and six months of age, after which theirreactions to dynamic facial expressions (neutral, lipsmacking and threats) weremeasured. Results showed that IN-OT, compared to placebo, increased the timemonkeys spent viewing the expression videos, but selectively reduced attention tothe eyes in neutral faces in a dose dependent manner. The mechanism for thisnon-prosocial effect may be that repeated IN-OT administration down-regulates theexpression of OT receptors in brain regions important for regulating socialattention. Consequently, our results raise questions about the efficacy ofimplementing chronic IN-OT as a pharmacotherapy for the treatment of socialdeficits, particularly if given early in development. More work is needed, notonly to identify optimal treatment schedules, but also to understand how IN-OTexerts its influences on the brain and behavior.
 The neural basis of how humans value and pursue social equality has become amajor topic in social neuroscience research. Although recent studies haveidentified a set of brain regions and possible mechanisms that are involved inthe neural processing of equality of outcome between individuals, how the humanbrain processes equality of opportunity remains unknown. In this review article, first we describe the importance of the distinction between equality of outcomeand equality of opportunity, which has been emphasized in philosophy andeconomics. Next, we discuss possible approaches for empirical characterization ofhuman valuation of equality of opportunity vs. equality of outcome. Understandinghow these two concepts are distinct and interact with each other may provide abetter explanation of complex human behaviors concerning fairness and socialequality.
 The prefrontal cortex (PFC) subserves complex cognitive abilities, includingrisky decision-making; the modulation of this brain area is shown to alter theway people take risks. Yet, neuromodulation of the PFC in relation to risk-takingbehavior remains relatively less well-studied. Moreover, the psychologicalvariables that influence such neuromodulation remain poorly understood. Toaddress these issues, 16 participants took part in 3 experimental sessions onseparate days. They received: (i) left anodal-right cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS); (ii) left cathodal-right anodal stimulation; or (iii)sham stimulation while they completed two risk-taking tasks. They also measuredon several cognitive-affective abilities and personality traits. It was revealed that left cathodal-right anodal stimulation led to significantly reducedrisk-taking under a context of haste. The reduction of risk-taking (relative tosham) correlated with state and trait impulsivity, such that the effect waslarger in more impulsive individuals. For these individuals, the tDCS effect sizewas considered to be large (generalized partial eta(2) > .17). The effect ofprefrontal-neuromodulation in reducing risk-taking was influenced by baselineimpulsivity, reflecting a state-dependent effect of neuromodulation on the PFC.The results of this study carry important insights into the use ofneuromodulation to alter higher cognition.
 Despite increasing interest in the effects of mental training practices such asmeditation, there is much ambiguity regarding whether and to what extent thevarious types of mental practice have differential effects on psychologicalchange. To address this gap, we compare the effects of four common meditationpractices on measures of state change in affect, mind-wandering, meta-cognition, and interoception. In the context of a 9-month mental training program called theReSource Project, 229 mid-life adults (mean age 41) provided daily reports beforeand after meditation practice. Participants received training in the followingthree successive modules: the first module (presence) included breathingmeditation and body scan, the second (affect) included loving-kindnessmeditation, and the third (perspective) included observing-thought meditation.Using multilevel modeling, we found that body scan led to the greatest stateincrease in interoceptive awareness and the greatest decrease in thought content,loving-kindness meditation led to the greatest increase in feelings of warmth andpositive thoughts about others, and observing-thought meditation led to thegreatest increase in meta-cognitive awareness. All practices, including breathingmeditation, increased positivity of affect, energy, and present focus anddecreased thought distraction. Complementary network analysis of intervariaterelationships revealed distinct phenomenological clusters of psychological changecongruent with the content of each practice. These findings together suggest thatalthough different meditation practices may have common beneficial effects, each practice can also be characterized by a distinct short-term psychologicalfingerprint, the latter having important implications for the use of meditativepractices in different intervention contexts and with different populations.
 Species have evolved diverse social behavior and mating strategies in response toselective forces in their environments. While promiscuity is the predominantmating strategy across most vertebrate taxa, convergent evolution of monogamousmating systems has occurred multiple times across distant lineages. Monogamousbehavior is thought to be facilitated by a neurobiological capacity to form andmaintain selective social attachments, or pair bonds, with a mating partner. The neural mechanisms of pair bonding behavior have been investigated most rigorouslyin Microtine rodents, which exhibit diverse social organizations. These studieshave highlighted mesolimbic dopamine pathways, social neuropeptides (oxytocin andvasopressin), and other neural systems as integral factors in the formation,maintenance, and expression of pair bonds.
 People seem to have difficulties when perceiving events whose outcome has noinfluence on the outcome of future events. This illusion that patterns existwhere there are none may lead to adverse consequences, such as escalating losses in financial trading or gambling debt. Despite the enormous social consequencesof these cognitive biases, however, their neural underpinnings are poorlyunderstood. Attempts to investigate them have so far relied on evoked neuralactivity, whereas spontaneous brain activity has been treated as noise to beaveraged out. Here, we focus on the spontaneous electroencephalographic (EEG)activity during inter-trial-intervals (ITI) in a sequential risky decision-makingtask. Using multilevel mediation analyses, our results show that the percentageof time covered by two EEG microstates (i.e., functional brain-states of coherentactivity) mediate the influence of outcomes of prior decisions on subsequent risktaking on a trial-by-trial basis. The devised multilevel mediation analysis ofthe temporal characteristics of EEG microstates during ITI provides a new window into the neurobiology of decision making by bringing the spontaneous brainactivity to the forefront of the analysis.
 The prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL) has consistently been found to be necessary for the acquisition of goal-directed actions in rodents. Nevertheless, thespecific cellular processes underlying this learning remain unknown. We assessed changes in learning-related expression of mitogen-activated proteinkinase/extracellular signal-related kinase (MAPK/ERK1/2) phosphorylation (pERK)in layers 2-3 and 5-6 of the anterior and posterior PL and in the population ofneurons projecting to posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS), also implicated ingoal-directed learning. Rats were given either a single session of training topress a lever for a pellet reward or yoked reward deliveries without instrumentaltraining and assessed 5 or 60 min after training for pERK expression. Relative toyoked training, instrumental training produced an increase in pERK expression in all regions of the PL both at 5 and 60 min, and this was accompanied by anincrease in nuclear pERK expression in the posterior PL in rats giveninstrumental training. pDMS-projecting neurons showed a transient increase inpERK expression in posterior layer 5-6 projection neurons after 5 min, and adelayed increase in anterior layer 2-3 neurons after 60 min, suggesting that ERK expression in the PL is necessary for the consolidation of goal-directedlearning. Consistent with this claim, we found that rats trained on two leverpress actions for distinct outcomes and then infused with the MEK inhibitorPD98059 into the PL immediately after training failed to acquire specificaction-outcome associations, suggesting that persistent pERK signaling in the PL is necessary for goal-directed learning. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The prelimbiccortex is implicated in goal-directed learning in rodents; however, it is unclearwhether it is involved in the consolidation of this learning, and what cellularprocesses are involved. We used pERK as a marker of activity-related synapticplasticity to assess learning-induced changes in distinct layers and neuronalpopulations of the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL). Training producedlong-lasting upregulation of pERK throughout the PL and specifically withinneurons that project to the pDMS, another region critical for goal-directedlearning. Next, we demonstrated that pERK signaling in the PL was necessary forthe consolidation of goal-directed learning. Together, these results indicatethat instrumental training induces ERK signaling in distinct layers andpopulations in the PL and this signaling underlies the consolidation ofgoal-directed learning.
 Visual processing of biological motion (BM) produced by living organisms is ofimmense value for successful daily-life activities and, in particular, foradaptive social behavior and nonverbal communication. Investigation of BMperception in neurodevelopmental disorders related to autism, preterm birth, and genetic conditions substantially contributes to our understanding of the neuralmechanisms underpinning the extraordinary tuning to BM. The most prominentresearch outcome is that patients with daily-life deficits in social cognitionare also compromised on visual body motion processing. This raises the questionof whether performance on body motion perception tasks may serve a hallmark ofsocial cognition. Overall, the findings highlight the role of structural andfunctional brain connectivity for proper functioning of the neural circuitryinvolved in BM processing and visual social cognition that share topographically and dynamically overlapping neural networks.
 Human and nonhuman primates show a preference for looking at faces with directgaze. In humans, this preference emerges shortly after birth, but little is knownabout the development of gaze preferences in monkeys. This study tracked thedevelopment of gaze preferences in infant monkeys from birth through 6 months of age using infrared eye-tracking. Although absent in the first week, a strongsignificant preference for direct compared to averted gaze faces emerged rapidly,peaking around 2 months of age. When looking at the eyes, the monkeys' fixations were equivalent in duration for both gaze types in the first 2 months, butthereafter remained longer for the averted gaze faces. Therefore, the infantsspent a greater proportion of time overall, but made shorter fixations, whenlooking at the direct compared to averted gaze faces. These results suggest that monkeys develop an efficient strategy when viewing the preferred direct gazefaces that involves longer viewing times, but shorter fixations.
 Our identity consists of knowledge about our individual attributes (personalidentity) as well as knowledge about our shared attributes derived from ourmembership in certain social groups (social identity). As individuals seek toachieve a positive self-image, they aim at comparing favorably with otherindividuals or their in-group comparing favorably with referent out-groups.Imaging data suggest a network centered on the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) toinstantiate functions that are integral to the self, conceived as the personalself. Given that the social self is constituted by the same mechanisms as thepersonal self, we expect MPFC activation also for situations in which the social self is addressed, for instance when situations permit evaluative intergroupcomparisons. Accordingly, participants worked on a modified version of theminimal group paradigm in the present functional magnetic resonance imagingexperiment. Imaging data revealed activation within a network centered on thedorsal MPFC specifically for social identity processes. Furthermore, thisactivation showed correlation with the displayed in-group bias. The presentfindings show that social and personal identity processes draw on the samecerebral correlates and hence it is concluded that a network centered on the MPFCsubserves functions integral to the self.
 Interpersonal distance and gaze provide a wealth of information duringface-to-face social interactions. These "proxemic" behaviors offer a window into everyday social cognition by revealing interactants' affective states (e.g.,interpersonal attitudes) and cognitive responses (e.g., social attention). Herewe provide a brief overview of the social psychological literature in thisdomain. We focus on new techniques for experimentally manipulating and measuring proxemics, including the use of immersive virtual environments and digital motioncapture. We also discuss ways in which these approaches can be integrated withpsychophysiological and neuroimaging techniques. Throughout, we argue thatcontemporary proxemics research provides psychology and neuroscience with a meansto study social cognition and behavior as they naturally emerge and unfold invivo.
 Recent neuroimaging research has revealed stronger empathic neural responses tosame-race compared to other-race individuals. Is the in-group favouritism inempathic neural responses specific to race identification or a more generaleffect of social identification-including those based on religious/irreligiousbeliefs? The present study investigated whether and how intergroup relationships based on religious/irreligious identifications modulate empathic neural responsesto others' pain expressions. We recorded event-related brain potentials fromChinese Christian and atheist participants while they perceived pain or neutralexpressions of Chinese faces that were marked as being Christians or atheists. Wefound that both Christian and atheist participants showed stronger neuralactivity to pain (versus neutral) expressions at 132-168 ms and 200-320 ms overthe frontal region to those with the same (versus different)religious/irreligious beliefs. The in-group favouritism in empathic neuralresponses was also evident in a later time window (412-612 ms) over thecentral/parietal regions in Christian but not in atheist participants. Ourresults indicate that the intergroup relationship based on shared beliefs, eitherreligious or irreligious, can lead to in-group favouritism in empathy for others'suffering.
 Self-construal priming modulates human behavior and associated neural activity.However, the neural activity associated with the self-construal priming procedureitself remains unknown. It is also unclear whether and how self-construal primingaffects neural activity prior to engaging in a particular task. To address thisgap, we scanned Chinese adults, using functional magnetic resonance imaging,during self-construal priming and a following resting state. We found that,relative to a calculation task, both interdependent and independentself-construal priming activated the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The contrast of interdependent vs.independent self-construal priming also revealed increased activity in the dorsalMPFC and left middle frontal cortex. The regional homogeneity analysis of theresting-state activity revealed increased local synchronization of spontaneousactivity in the dorsal MPFC but decreased local synchronization of spontaneousactivity in the PCC when contrasting interdependent vs. independentself-construal priming. The functional connectivity analysis of the resting-stateactivity, however, did not show significant difference in synchronization ofactivities in remote brain regions between different priming conditions. Ourfindings suggest that accessible collectivistic/individualistic mind-set induced by self-construal priming is associated with modulations of both task-related andresting-state activity in the default mode network.
 OBJECTIVE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an idiopathic and fatalneurodegenerative disease of the human motor system. While microstructuralalterations in corpus callosum (CC) have been identified as a consistent feature of ALS, studies directly examining interhemispheric neural connectivity are stilllacking. To shed more light on the pathophysiology of ALS, the present study aimsto examine alterations of interhemispheric structural and functional connectivityin individuals with ALS. METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) andresting-state functional MRI (rfMRI) data were acquired from 38 individuals with ALS and 35 gender-matched and age-matched control subjects. Indices ofinterhemispheric functional and structural neural connection were derived withanalyses of voxel mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) and probabilistic fibre tracking. RESULTS: The rfMRI has revealed extensive reductions of VMHC associatedwith ALS in brain regions of the precentral and postcentral gyrus, theparacentral lobule, the superior temporal gyrus, the middle cingulate gyrus, the putamen and the superior parietal lobules. With DTI, the analysis has alsorevealed reductions of interhemispheric structural connectivity through the CCsubregions II, III and V in patients with ALS. Additionally, interhemisphericfunctional connectivity of the bilateral precentral gyri positively correlatedwith fractional anisotropy values of the CC subregion III, which structurallyconnects the bilateral motor cortices. CONCLUSIONS: The present data provideddirect evidence confirming and extending the view of impaired interhemisphericneural communications mediated by CC, providing a new perspective forexaminations and understanding the pathophysiology of ALS.
 We investigated a combination of three classification algorithms, namely themodified maximum uncertainty linear discriminant analysis (mMLDA), the centroidmethod, and the average linkage, with three types of features extracted fromthree-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) brain images, specifically MR intensities, grey matter densities, and local deformations for distinguishing 49 first episode schizophrenia male patients from 49 healthy male subjects. Thefeature sets were reduced using intersubject principal component analysis before classification. By combining the classifiers, we were able to obtain slightlyimproved results when compared with single classifiers. The best classificationperformance (81.6% accuracy, 75.5% sensitivity, and 87.8% specificity) wassignificantly better than classification by chance. We also showed thatclassifiers based on features calculated using more computation-intensive imagepreprocessing perform better; mMLDA with classification boundary calculated asweighted mean discriminative scores of the groups had improved sensitivity butsimilar accuracy compared to the original MLDA; reducing a number of eigenvectorsduring data reduction did not always lead to higher classification accuracy,since noise as well as the signal important for classification were removed. Our findings provide important information for schizophrenia research and may improveaccuracy of computer-aided diagnostics of neuropsychiatric diseases.
 BACKGROUND: Understanding social interactions requires the ability to accurately interpret conspecifics' actions, sometimes only on the basis of subtle bodylanguage analysis. Here we address an important issue that has not yet receivedmuch attention in social neuroscience, that of an interaction between two agents.We attempted to isolate brain responses to two individuals interacting comparedto two individuals acting independently. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used minimalistic point-light displays to depict the characters, as they provide themost straightforward way to isolate mechanisms used to extract information frommotion per se without any interference with other visual information. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method was used to determine which brainregions were recruited during the observation of two interacting agents,mimicking everyday social scenes. While the mirror and mentalizing networks arerarely concurrently active, we found that both of them might be needed to catchthe social intentions carried by whole-body motion. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:These findings shed light on how motor cognition contributes to social cognition when social information is embedded in whole-body motion only. Finally, theapproach described here provides a valuable and original tool for investigatingthe brain networks responsible for social understanding, in particular inpsychiatric disorders.
 Recent advances in social neuroscience research have unveiled theneurophysiological correlates of race and intergroup processing. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying intergroup empathy. Combiningevent-related fMRI with measurements of pupil dilation as an index of autonomicreactivity, we explored how race and group membership affect empathy-relatedresponses. White and Black subjects were presented with video clips depictingwhite, black, and unfamiliar violet-skinned hands being either painfullypenetrated by a syringe or being touched by a Q-tip. Both hemodynamic activitywithin areas known to be involved in the processing of first and third-personemotional experiences of pain, i.e., bilateral anterior insula, and autonomicreactivity were greater for the pain experienced by own-race compared to that of other-race and violet models. Interestingly, greater implicit racial biaspredicted increased activity within the left anterior insula during theobservation of own-race pain relative to other-race pain. Our findings highlight the close link between group-based segregation and empathic processing. Moreover,they demonstrate the relative influence of culturally acquired implicit attitudesand perceived similarity/familiarity with the target in shaping emotionalresponses to others' physical pain.
 The validity and reliability of stereotypes in social perception confirmstraditional early social psychological research. Already in 1954 Gordon Allportstated that stereotypes might have a "kernel of truth." Recent research in socialneuroscience, however, contradicts Lee Jussims' (2012) claim that the applicationof stereotypes increases accuracy in person perception. Person perception isinaccurate as it is insufficient when it involves only one factor (even if thatfactor was a reliable predictor).
 Acting appropriately within social contexts requires an ability to appreciateothers' mental and emotional states. Indeed, some campaign programs designed toreduce anti-social behaviour seek to elicit empathy for the victims. Theeffectiveness of these campaigns can be evaluated according to the degree towhich they induce such responses, but by applying neuroscientific techniques thiscan be done at the behavioural and neurophysiological level. Neuroimaging studiesaimed at identifying the neural mechanisms behind such socio-cognitive and-emotional processes frequently reveal the role of the superior temporal sulcus(STS). We applied this knowledge to assess the effectiveness of traffic-awarenesscampaign adverts to induce empathic expression. Functional magnetic resonanceimaging (fMRI) data were acquired from 20 healthy male volunteers as they watchedthese campaign videos consisting of a dramatic sequence of events andcatastrophic endings, and control videos without such dramatic endings. Amongother structures, a significantly greater neural response was observed withinbilateral STS, particularly within the right hemisphere, during the observationof campaign relative to control videos. Furthermore, activation in these brainregions correlated with the subjects' empathic expression. Our results developour understanding of the role of STS in social cognition. Moreover, our datademonstrate the utility of neuroscientific methods when evaluating theeffectiveness of campaign videos in terms of their ability to elicit empathicresponses. Our study also demonstrates the utility of these specific stimuli for future neuroscientific research.
 We argue that Schilbach et al. have neglected an important part of the socialneuroscience literature involving participants in social interactions. We alsoclarify some part of the models the authors discussed superficially. We finallypropose that social neuroscience should take into consideration the effect ofbeing observed and the complexity of the task as potentially influencing factors.
 Learning under uncertainty is a common task that people face in their daily life.This process relies on the cognitive ability to adjust behavior to environmental demands. Although the biological underpinnings of those cognitive processes have been extensively studied, there has been little work in formal models seeking to capture the fundamental dynamic of learning under uncertainty. In the presentwork, we aimed to understand the basic cognitive mechanisms of outcome processinginvolved in decisions under uncertainty and to evaluate the relevance of previousexperiences in enhancing learning processes within such uncertain context. Wepropose a formal model that emulates the behavior of people playing a wellestablished paradigm (Iowa Gambling Task - IGT) and compare its outcome with abehavioral experiment. We further explored whether it was possible to emulatemaladaptive behavior observed in clinical samples by modifying the modelparameter which controls the update of expected outcomes distributions. Resultsshowed that the performance of the model resembles the observed participantperformance as well as IGT performance by healthy subjects described in theliterature. Interestingly, the model converges faster than some subjects on thedecks with higher net expected outcome. Furthermore, the modified version of the model replicated the trend observed in clinical samples performing the task. Weargue that the basic cognitive component underlying learning under uncertaintycan be represented as a differential equation that considers the outcomes ofprevious decisions for guiding the agent to an adaptive strategy.
 Social neuroscience is rapidly exploring the complex territory between perceptionand action where recognition, value, and meaning are instantiated. This reviewfollows the trail of research on oxytocin and vasopressin as an exemplar of onepath for exploring the "dark matter" of social neuroscience. Studies acrossvertebrate species suggest that these neuropeptides are important for socialcognition, with gender- and steroid-dependent effects. Comparative research involes yields a model based on interspecies and intraspecies variation of thegeography of oxytocin receptors and vasopressin V1a receptors in the forebrain.Highly affiliative species have receptors in brain circuits related to reward or reinforcement. The neuroanatomical distribution of these receptors may be guided by variations in the regulatory regions of their respective genes. This reviewdescribes the promises and problems of extrapolating these findings to humansocial cognition, with specific reference to the social deficits of autism.
 Clinical reports and case studies suggest that traumatic brain injury (TBI) canhave significant social consequences, with social dysfunction reported to be the most debilitating problem for child and adolescent survivors. From a socialneuroscience perspective, evidence suggests that social skills are not localized to a specific brain region, but are mediated by an integrated neural network.Many components of this network are susceptible to disruption in the context ofTBI. In early development, a brain injury can disrupt this neural network whileit is in the process of being established, resulting in social dysfunction. Inorder to clarify the prevalence and nature of social dysfunction after child TBI,studies of social outcomes in children and adolescents after TBI over the last 23years have been reviewed. Despite casting a wide net initially, only 28 articles met review criteria. These studies were characterized by methodologicalweaknesses, including variations in definitions of TBI, limited assessment tools,reliance on parent reports, small sample sizes, and absent control groups.Despite these limitations, the weight of evidence confirmed an elevated risk ofsocial impairment in the context of moderate and severe injury. While rarelyexamined, younger age at insult, pathology to frontal regions and the corpuscallosum, and social disadvantage and family dysfunction may also increase thelikelihood of social difficulties. More research is needed to obtain an accurate picture of social outcomes post-brain injury.
 In the introduction to the special issue "The Neural Underpinnings of VicariousExperience" the editors state that one "may feel embarrassed when witnessinganother making a social faux pas". In our commentary we address this statementand ask whether this example introduces a vicarious or an empathic form ofembarrassment. We elaborate commonalities and differences between these two formsof emotional experiences and discuss their underlying mechanisms. We suggest thatboth, vicarious and empathic emotions, originate from the simulation processesmirroring and mentalizing that depend on anchoring and adjustment. We claim theterm "empathic emotion" to be reserved exclusively for incidents where perceiversand social targets have shared affective experience, whereas "vicarious emotion" offers a wider scope and also includes non-shared affective experiences. Both aresupposed to be highly functional in social interactions.
 The incentive structure of a scientist's life is increasingly mimicking economic principles. While intensely criticized, the journal impact factor (JIF) has takena role as the new currency for scientists. Successful goal-directed behavior inacademia thus requires knowledge about the JIF. Using functional neuroimaging we examined how the JIF, as a powerful incentive in academia, has shaped thebehavior of scientists and the reward signal in the striatum. We demonstrate thatthe reward signal in the nucleus accumbens increases with higher JIF during theanticipation of a publication and found a positive correlation with the personal publication record (pJIF) supporting the notion that scientists have incorporatedthe predominant reward principle of the scientific community in their rewardsystem. The implications of this behavioral adaptation within the ecologicalniche of the scientist's habitat remain unknown, but may also have effects which were not intended by the community.
 Recent evidence suggests that postpartum depression is associated with reducedamygdala (AMY) response to negative stimuli. However, given the anhedonicfeatures of PPD, it is important to consider mothers' brain response specificallyto positive infant and to other positive stimuli. Mothers with (n = 28) andwithout (n = 17) clinically determined PPD (n = 28) viewed smiling pictures ofinfants (Own and Other), and positive non-infant stimuli (Non-Infant). First, we examined group differences in AMY response across conditions. Next,psychophysiological interaction was used to examine group differences in AMYconnectivity across conditions. Connectivity estimates were then correlated with measures of maternal mood and anxiety. PPD mothers, compared to non-PPD mothers, showed overall increased AMY response across conditions in the right AMY. Despitethis, PPD mothers demonstrated decreased bilateral AMY-right insular cortex (IC) connectivity as compared to non-PPD mothers when they view Own-Other infants.Furthermore, decreasing AMY-IC connectivity was associated with increasingsymptoms of depression and anxiety. These differences were evident only forinfant stimuli and did not apply to all positively valenced stimuli. Thus, PPDmothers show altered brain response and connectivity in regions stronglyimplicated in the processing of socially and emotionally relevant stimuli, aswell as interoception and the evaluation of subjective emotional experience.
 Stress disorders are among the most commonly occurring of all mental disorders.In this context, the question arises whether the stress inevitably unfoldingaround us has the potential to "contaminate" and compromise us. In the currentmulti-center study, we investigate the existence of such empathic stress (definedas a full-blown physiological stress response that arises solely by observing atarget undergo a stressful situation), and whether empathic stress permeates tothe core of the stress system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.Additionally, we investigate whether empathic stress responses may be modulatedby the familiarity between observer and target (partners vs. strangers), themodality of observation (real-life vs. virtual) and observer sex (female vs.male). Participants were tested in dyads, paired with a loved one or a strangerof the opposite sex. While the target of the dyad (n=151) was exposed to apsychosocial stressor, the observer (n=211) watched through a one-way mirror orvia live video transmission. Overall, 26% of the observers displayedphysiologically significant cortisol increases. This empathic stress was morepronounced in intimate observer-target dyads (40%) and during the real-liferepresentation of the stressor (30%). Empathic stress was further modulated byinterindividual differences in empathy measures. Despite the higher prevalence ofempathic stress in the partner and real-life observation conditions, significant cortisol responses also emerged in strangers (10%) and the virtual observationmodality (24%). The occurrence of empathic stress down to the level of HPA-axisactivation, in some cases even in total strangers and when only virtuallywitnessing another's distress, may have important implications for thedevelopment of stress-related diseases.
 Human attitudes and preferences are susceptible to social influence. Recentsocial neuroscience studies, using theories and experimental paradigms fromsocial psychology, have begun to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying howothers influence our attitudes through processes such as social conformity,cognitive inconsistency and persuasion. The currently available evidencehighlights the role of the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) in socialconformity and cognitive inconsistency, which represents the discrepancy between one's own and another person's opinion, or, more broadly, between currentlyinconsistent and ideally consistent states. Research on persuasion has revealedthat people's susceptibility to persuasive messages is related to activation in anearby but more anterior part of the medial frontal cortex. Future progress inthis field will depend upon the ability of researchers to dissociate underlyingmotivations for attitude change in different paradigms, and to utilizeneuroimaging methods to advance social psychological theories of socialinfluence.
 Legal decisions often require logical reasoning about the mental states of peoplewho perform gruesome behaviors. We use functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) to examine how brain regions implicated in logical reasoning are modulatedby emotion and social cognition during legal decision-making. Participants readvignettes describing crimes that elicit strong or weak disgust matched onpunishment severity using the US Federal Sentencing Guidelines. An extraneoussentence at the end of each vignette described the perpetrator's personalityusing traits or biological language, mimicking the increased use of scientificevidence presented in courts. Behavioral results indicate that crimes weak indisgust receive significantly less punishment than the guidelines recommend.Neuroimaging results indicate that brain regions active during logical reasoning respond less to crimes weak in disgust and biological descriptions ofpersonality, demonstrating the impact of emotion and social cognition on logical reasoning mechanisms necessary for legal decision-making.
 The perception and interpretation of social hierarchies are a key part of oursocial life. In the present research we considered the activation of corticalareas, mainly the prefrontal cortex, related to social ranking perception inconjunction with some personality components (BAS - Behavioral Activation System - and BIS - Behavioral Inhibition System). In two experiments we manipulated the perceived superior/inferior status during a competitive cognitive task. Indeed,we created an explicit and strongly reinforced social hierarchy based onincidental rating in an attentional task. Specifically, a peer group comparisonwas undertaken and improved (Experiment 1) or decreased (Experiment 2)performance was artificially manipulated by the experimenter. For each experimenttwo groups were compared, based on a BAS and BIS dichotomy. Alpha band modulationin prefrontal cortex, behavioral measures (performance: error rate, ER; response times, RTs), and self-perceived ranking were considered. Repeated measures ANOVAsand regression analyses showed in Experiment 1 a significant improved cognitiveperformance (decreased ER and RTs) and higher self-perceived ranking in high-BAS participants. Moreover, their prefrontal activity was increased within the leftside (alpha band decreasing). Conversely, in Experiment 2 a significant decreasedcognitive performance (increased ER and RTs) and lower self-perceived ranking wasobserved in higher-BIS participants. Their prefrontal right activity wasincreased in comparison with higher BAS. The regression analyses confirmed thesignificant predictive role of alpha band modulation with respect of subjects'performance and self-perception of social ranking, differently for BAS/BIScomponents. The present results suggest that social status perception is directlymodulated by cortical activity and personality correlates.
 The overlap between pain and reward processing pathways leds researchers tohypothesize that there are interactions between them in the human brain. Twohypotheses have been proposed. The "competition hypothesis" posits that rewardcan reduce pain-related neural activity and vice versa. The "salience hypothesis"suggests that the motivational salience of pain and reward can be mutuallyreinforced. However, no study has tested these two hypotheses from temporalperspective as we know. In the present study, pictures depicted other people inpainful or non-painful situations were used to indicate the valence of outcomesin a gambling task. The event-related potential results revealed an interactionbetween another person's pain and outcome valence in multiple time stages.Specifically, the amplitudes of the N1 and P3 were enhanced in the win condition compared with the loss condition when the outcome was indicated by painfulpicture. This interactions between pain and reward support the saliencehypothesis but not the competition hypothesis. The present results provideevidence from human subjects that support the salience hypothesis, which claimsthat observing other people's pain can enhance the salience of reward.
 The feeling of voluntary control and awareness of movement is fundamental to our notions of selfhood and responsibility for actions, yet can be lost inneuropsychiatric syndromes (e.g. delusions of control, non-epileptic seizures)and culturally influenced dissociative states (e.g. attributions of spiritpossession). The brain processes involved remain poorly understood. We usedsuggestion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate lossof control and awareness of right hand movements in 15 highly hypnoticallysuggestible subjects. Loss of perceived control of movements was associated with reduced connectivity between supplementary motor area (SMA) and motor regions.Reduced awareness of involuntary movements was associated with less activation inparietal cortices (BA 7, BA 40) and insula. Collectively these results suggestthat the sense of voluntary control of movement may critically depend on thefunctional coupling of SMA with motor systems, and provide a potential neuralbasis for the narrowing of awareness reported in pathological and culturallyinfluenced dissociative phenomena.
 The ability to recognize faces is an important socio-cognitive skill that isassociated with a number of cognitive specializations in humans. While numerousstudies have examined the presence of these specializations in non-humanprimates, species where face recognition would confer distinct advantages insocial situations, results have been mixed. The majority of studies inchimpanzees support homologous face-processing mechanisms with humans, butresults from monkey studies appear largely dependent on the type of testingmethods used. Studies that employ passive viewing paradigms, like the visualpaired comparison task, report evidence of similarities between monkeys andhumans, but tasks that use more stringent, operant response tasks, like thematching-to-sample task, often report species differences. Moreover, the datasuggest that monkeys may be less sensitive than chimpanzees and humans to theprecise spacing of facial features, in addition to the surface-based cuesreflected in those features, information that is critical for the representation of individual identity. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensivereview of the available data from face-processing tasks in non-human primateswith the goal of understanding the evolution of this complex cognitive skill.
 The cerebellum is believed to play an essential role in a variety of motor andcognitive functions through reciprocal interaction with the cerebral cortex.Recent findings suggest that cerebellar involvement in the network specializedfor visual body motion processing may be mediated through interaction with theright superior temporal sulcus (STS). Yet, the underlying pattern of structuralconnectivity between the STS and the cerebellum remains unidentified. In thepresent work, diffusion tensor imaging analysis on seeds derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging during a task on point-light biological motionperception uncovers a structural pathway between the right posterior STS and the left cerebellar lobule Crus I. The findings suggest existence of a structuralloop underpinning bidirectional communication between the STS and cerebellum.This connection might also be of potential value for other visual socialabilities.
 The conditions under which we identify entities as animate agents and the neural mechanisms supporting this ability are central questions in social neuroscience. Prior studies have focused upon 2 perceptual cues for signaling animacy: 1)surface features representing body forms such as faces, torsos, and limbs and 2) motion cues associated with biological forms. Here, we consider a third cue--the goal-directedness of an action. Regions in the social brain network, such as the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and fusiform face area (FFA), areactivated by human-like motion and body form perceptual cues signaling animacy.Here, we investigate whether these same brain regions are activated bygoal-directed motion even when performed by entities that lack human-likeperceptual cues. We observed an interaction effect whereby the presence of eitherhuman-like perceptual cues or goal-directed actions was sufficient to activatethe right pSTS and FFA. Only stimuli that lacked human-like perceptual cues andgoal-directed actions failed to activate the pSTS and FFA at the same level.
 Traditionally, communication has been defined as the intentional exchange ofsymbolic information between individuals. In contrast, the mirror system providesa basis for nonsymbolic and nonintentional information exchange betweenindividuals. We believe that understanding the role of the mirror system in jointaction has the potential to serve as a bridge between these two domains. Thepresent study investigates one crucial component of joint action: the ability to represent others' potential actions in the same way as one's own in the absenceof perceptual evidence. In two experiments a joint spatial numerical association of response codes (SNARC) effect is demonstrated, providing further evidence thatindividuals form functionally equivalent representations of their own and others'potential actions. It is shown that numerical (symbolic) stimuli that are mapped onto a spatially arranged internal representation (a mental number line) canactivate a co-represented action in the same way as spatial stimuli. Thisgeneralizes previous results on co-representation.We discuss the role of themirror system in co-representation as a basis for shared intentionality andcommunication.
 BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest is a devastating complication of acute ischemicstroke, but little is known about its incidence and characteristics. We studied alarge ischemic stroke inpatient population and compared patients with and withoutcardiac arrest. METHODS: We studied consecutive patients from the Ontario Stroke Registry who had an ischemic stroke between July 2003 and June 2008 at 11tertiary care stroke centers in Ontario. Multivariable analyses were used todetermine independent predictors of cardiac arrest and associated outcomes.Adjusted survival curves were computed, and hazard ratios for mortality at 30days and 1 year were determined for cardiac arrest and other major outcomes.RESULTS: Among the 9019 patients with acute ischemic stroke, 352 had cardiacarrest, for an overall incidence of 3.9%. In a sensitivity analysis withpalliative patients removed, the incidence of cardiac arrest was 2.5%.Independent predictors of cardiac arrest were as follows: older age, greaterstroke severity, preadmission dependence, and a history of diabetes, myocardialinfarction, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. Systemiccomplications associated with cardiac arrest were as follows: myocardialinfarction, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, andpneumonia. Patients with cardiac arrest had higher disability at discharge, and amarkedly increased 30-day mortality of 82.1% compared with 9.3% without cardiacarrest. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac arrest had a high incidence and was associated with poor outcomes after ischemic stroke, including multiple medical complications andvery high mortality. Predictors of cardiac arrest identified in this study could help risk stratify ischemic stroke patients for cardiac investigations andprolonged cardiac monitoring.
 Previous studies identified a network of brain regions involved in the perceptionof norm violations, including insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and right temporoparietal junction area (RTPJ). Activations in these regions are suggested to reflect the perception of norm violations and unfairness. The current studyaimed to test this hypothesis by exploring whether a personal disposition toperceive the world as being just is related to neural responses to moralevaluations. The just-world-hypothesis describes a cognitive bias to believe in ajust world in which everyone gets what he or she deserves and deserves what he orshe gets. Since it has been demonstrated that ACC, RTPJ, and insula are involved in the perception of unfairness, we hypothesized that individual differences inthe belief in a just world are reflected by different activations of these brain areas. Participants were confronted with scenarios describing norm-violating or-confirming behavior. FMRI results revealed an activation of dorsal ACC, RTPJ,and insula when perceiving norm violations, but only activity ininsula/somatosensory cortex correlated with the belief in a just world. Thus, ourresults suggest a role for insula/somatosensory cortex for the belief in a justworld.
 Family assistance is an important aspect of family relationships for adolescents across many cultures and contexts. Motivations to help family members may bedriven by both cultural factors and early family experiences. Here, we usedfunctional magnetic resonance imaging to examine (1) cultural differences inneural reward activity among White and Latino youth during online experiences of family assistance and (2) how prior family experiences related to neural rewardactivity when helping the family. Participants were scanned as they madedecisions to contribute money to their family and themselves. Latino and Whiteparticipants showed similar behavioral levels of helping but distinct patterns ofneural activity within the mesolimbic reward system. Whereas Latino participants showed more reward activity when contributing to their family, White participantsshowed more reward activity when gaining cash for themselves. In addition,participants who felt more identified with their family and who derived greaterfulfillment from helping their family two years prior to the scan showedincreased reward system activation when contributing to their family. Theseresults suggest that family assistance may be guided, in part, by the personalrewards one attains from that assistance, and that this sense of reward may bemodulated by cultural influences and prior family experiences.
 BACKGROUND: There is evidence of abnormal cerebral dopamine transmission innicotine-dependent smokers, but it is unclear whether dopaminergic abnormalities are due to acute nicotine abuse or whether they persist with abstinence. Weaddressed this question by conducting longitudinal positron emission tomography(PET) examination of smokers before and after 3 months of abstinence. METHODS: Weobtained baseline 6-[(18)F]fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA)-PET scans in 15 nonsmokers and30 nicotine-dependent smokers, who either smoked as per their usual habit or werein acute withdrawal. All smokers then underwent cessation treatment, andsuccessful abstainers were re-examined by FDOPA-PET after 3 months of abstinence (n = 15). Uptake of FDOPA was analyzed using a steady-state model yieldingestimates of the dopamine synthesis capacity (K); the turnover of tracer dopamineformed in living brain (kloss); and the tracer distribution volume (Vd), which isan index of dopamine storage capacity. RESULTS: Compared with nonsmokers, K was15% to 20% lower in the caudate nuclei of consuming smokers. Intraindividualcomparisons of consumption and long-term abstinence revealed significantincreases in K in the right dorsal and left ventral caudate nuclei. Relative toacute withdrawal, Vd significantly decreased in the right ventral and dorsalcaudate after prolonged abstinence. Severity of nicotine dependence significantlycorrelated with dopamine synthesis capacity and dopamine turnover in thebilateral ventral putamen of consuming smokers. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a lower dopamine synthesis capacity in nicotine-dependent smokers that appears tonormalize with abstinence. Further investigations are needed to clarify the role of dopamine in nicotine addiction to help develop smoking prevention andcessation treatments.
 The present study investigated whether emotional states influence the neuralprocessing of language. Event-related potentials recorded the brain's response topositively and negatively valenced words (e.g., love vs. death) whileparticipants were directly induced into positive and negative moods. ERPelectrodes in frontal scalp regions of the brain distinguished positive andnegative words around 400 ms poststimulus. The amplitude of this negativewaveform showed a larger negativity for positive words compared to negative wordsin the frontal electrode region when participants were in a positive, but notnegative, mood. These findings build on previous research by demonstrating thatpeople process affective language differently when in positive and negativemoods, and lend support to recent views that emotion and cognition interactduring language comprehension.
 Research in social neuroscience has uncovered a social knowledge network that is particularly attuned to making social judgments. However, the processes that are being performed by both regions within this network and those outside of thisnetwork that are nevertheless engaged in the service of making a social judgment remain unclear. To help address this, we drew upon research in semantic memory,which suggests that making a semantic judgment engages 2 distinct controlprocesses: A controlled retrieval process, which aids in bringing goal-relevantinformation to mind from long-term stores, and a selection process, which aids inselecting the information that is goal-relevant from the information retrieved.In a neuroimaging study, we investigated whether controlled retrieval andselection for social information engage distinct portions of both the socialknowledge network and regions outside this network. Controlled retrieval forsocial information engaged an anterior ventrolateral portion of the prefrontalcortex, whereas selection engaged both the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex andtemporoparietal junction within the social knowledge network. These resultssuggest that the social knowledge network may be more involved with the selectionof social information than the controlled retrieval of it and incorporateslateral prefrontal regions in accessing memory for making social judgments.
 Nearly 25 years ago, the shared interests of psychologists and biologists inunderstanding the neural basis of social behavior led to the inception of social neuroscience. In the past decade, this field has exploded, in large part due tothe infusion of studies that use fMRI. At the same time, tensions have arisenabout how to prioritize a diverse range of questions and about the authority ofneurobiological data in answering them. The field is now poised to tackle some ofthe most interesting and important questions about human and animal behavior but at the same time faces uncertainty about how to achieve focus in its research andcohesion among the scientists who tackle it. The next 25 years offer theopportunity to alleviate some of these growing pains, as well as the challenge ofanswering large questions that encompass the nature and bounds of diverse social interactions (in humans, including interactions through the internet); how tocharacterize, and treat, social dysfunction in psychiatric illness; and how tocompare social cognition in humans with that in other animals.
 Social neuroscience has shed light on the underpinnings of understanding otherminds. The current study investigated the effect of self-involvement duringsocial interaction on attention, arousal, and facial expression. Specifically, wesought to disentangle the effect of being personally addressed from the effect ofdecoding the meaning of another person's facial expression. To this end, eyemovements, pupil size, and facial electromyographic (EMG) activity were recorded while participants observed virtual characters gazing at them or looking atsomeone else. In dynamic animations, the virtual characters then displayed eithersocially relevant facial expressions (similar to those used in everyday lifesituations to establish interpersonal contact) or arbitrary facial movements. Theresults show that attention allocation, as assessed by eye-tracking measurements,was specifically related to self-involvement regardless of the social meaningbeing conveyed. Arousal, as measured by pupil size, was primarily related toperceiving the virtual character's gender. In contrast, facial EMG activity wasdetermined by the perception of socially relevant facial expressions irrespectiveof whom these were directed towards.
 Previous studies have shown right parietal activation in response to observingirrational actions. Behavioural studies show that people sometimes imitateirrational actions, a phenomenon called overimitation. However, limitations onmovement in fMRI mean that the neural basis of overimitation has not beenstudied. To address this, our study employed a less restrictive neuroimagingtechnique, functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Measurements were takenwhile participants observed either rational or irrational movements beforeperforming movements on a computerised puzzle task. Observing irrational actions produced greater activation in right anterior inferior parietal lobule (aIPL),replicating results from the fMRI literature. This is a proof of principle thatfNIRS can be used as an alternative to fMRI in social cognition experiments, and that parietal cortex has a core role in responding to irrational actions.
 Empathizing is a quantitative trait involving understanding another's mentalstate (including their emotion) and responding to this with an appropriateemotion. A reliable, behaviorally validated self-report questionnaire measure of this is the Empathy Quotient (EQ), which is continuously distributed across thegeneral population. The "discrete emotions" model posits that each "basic"emotion has a relatively independent evolutionary antecedent andsocial-communicative function and is subserved by a discrete neural system. Inthis study, we investigate if and how empathy influences the perception of basic emotions. Twenty-five volunteers (13 female, 12 male) selected across EQ spaceparticipated in a correlational design 3T fMRI study. The stimuli were presented in a box-car design, where 5 blocks (each containing 4 video clips of any one of happy, sad, angry, disgust or neutral expressions from different actors) and alow-level baseline were presented in pseudo-random order. Using an exploratoryanalysis, we found different brain regions correlated with EQ, depending on whichemotion was being perceived. In particular, the ventral striatal response tohappy faces correlated positively with EQ, while the ventral striatal response tosad faces was negatively correlated with EQ. The precuneus and lateral prefrontalcortical response to angry faces correlated positively with EQ. The response ofthe insula and the superior temporal gyrus cortex to disgust faces werenegatively correlated with EQ. These results are discussed in the light of thepostulated evolutionary function of each emotion. Using a hypothesis-drivenconjunction analysis, we found that a region in the left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus/premotor cortex was positively correlated to the EQ across all fouremotions. This region could therefore constitute a biomarker for trait empathyacross emotions. We conclude that there are common regions underlying empathyacross different emotions, and there are regions that show an emotion-specificcorrelation with empathy. This pattern of results is interpreted using amodification of Haxby et al.'s model of face perception.
 Joint Action is typically described as social interaction that requirescoordination among two or more co-actors in order to achieve a common goal. Inthis article, we put forward a hypothesis for the existence of aneural-computational mechanism of affective valuation that may be criticallyexploited in Joint Action. Such a mechanism would serve to facilitatecoordination between co-actors permitting a reduction of required information.Our hypothesized affective mechanism provides a value function basedimplementation of Associative Two-Process (ATP) theory that entails theclassification of external stimuli according to outcome expectancies. Thisapproach has been used to describe animal and human action that concernsdifferential outcome expectancies. Until now it has not been applied to socialinteraction. We describe our Affective ATP model as applied to social learningconsistent with an "extended common currency" perspective in the socialneuroscience literature. We contrast this to an alternative mechanism thatprovides an example implementation of the so-called social-specific valueperspective. In brief, our Social-Affective ATP mechanism builds upon establishedformalisms for reinforcement learning (temporal difference learning models)nuanced to accommodate expectations (consistent with ATP theory) and extended to integrate non-social and social cues for use in Joint Action.
 The prevalence of psychosocial stress in Western societies is constantly on therise. Its influence on social decision-making, however, remains poorlyunderstood. Whereas, it is known that stress triggers psychological andphysiological defense mechanisms, indications of such patterns in socialdecisions are ambivalent. We sought to elucidate the underlying mechanisms ofstress-induced social decisions. We recruited 145 men, who were individuallyexposed to either a psychosocial stressor or a control condition, while primedwith affiliation by interacting either with members of an in- or an out-group. Wefound that stressed participants were less trusting and engaged in less costlypunishment compared to the non-stressed control group. Interacting with out-groupmembers led to less reciprocity and more spiteful punishment. There was nointeraction between stress and the affiliation conditions in any of the usedsocial-decision-making paradigms. Lastly, while stress-reactive cortisol levelshad no effect on trust behavior, higher baseline cortisol was correlated withgreater trust. Our findings suggest that previous ambiguities in data reported onthe influence of stress on social decisions, namely tend-and-befriend behaviormay have arisen through critical social confounds in the induction of stress.When controlling for potential social confounds, stress may triggerfight-or-flight behavior as indicated by increased social anxiety. These findingshighlight the considerable context-dependence of psychosocial stress and itseffects on social behavior.
 Social buffering, which is the attenuation of stress hormone release by a social partner, occurs in many species throughout the lifespan. Social buffering of the infant by the caregiver is particularly robust, and animal models using infantrodents are uncovering the mechanisms and neural circuitry supporting socialbuffering. At birth, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress system isfunctional but is suppressed via extended social buffering by the mother: theprofound social buffering effects of the mother can last for 1-2 hours when pups are removed from the mother. At 10 days of age, pups begin to mount a stressresponse immediately when separated from the mother. The stimuli from the mother supporting social buffering are broad, for tactile stimulation, milk, and ananesthetized mother (no maternal behavior) all sufficiently support socialbuffering. The mother appears to produce social buffering by blockingnorepinephrine (NE) release into the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which blocks HPA activation. Since the infant amygdala relies on the presence of corticosterone (CORT), this suggests that social buffering of pups by the mother attenuates the neurobehavioral stress response in infancy and prevents pups from learning about threat within mother-infant interactions.
 This paper reviews the published literature on the hyperscanning methodologiesusing hemodynamic or neuro-electric modalities. In particular, we describe howdifferent brain recording devices have been employed in different experimentalparadigms to gain information about the subtle nature of human interactions. Thisreview also included papers based on single-subject recordings in which acorrelation was found between the activities of different (non-simultaneouslyrecorded) participants in the experiment. The descriptions begin with themethodological issues related to the simultaneous measurements and thedescriptions of the results generated by such approaches will follow. Finally, a discussion of the possible future uses of such new approaches to explore humansocial interactions will be presented.
 Theoretical accounts of emotion regulation (ER) discriminate various cognitivestrategies to voluntarily modify emotional states. Amongst these, attentionaldeployment (i.e. distraction) and cognitive change (i.e. reappraisal), have been shown to successfully down-regulate emotions. Neuroimaging studies found thatboth strategies differentially engage neural structures associated with selectiveattention, working memory and cognitive control. The aim of this study was tofurther delineate similarities and differences between the ER strategiesreappraisal and distraction by investigating their temporal brain dynamics using event-related potentials (ERPs) and their patterns of facial expressive behavior.Twenty-one participants completed an ER experiment in which they had to eitherpassively view positive, neutral and negative pictures, reinterpret them todown-regulate affective responses (reappraisal), or solve a concurrentlypresented mathematical equation (distraction). Results demonstrate the efficacyof both strategies in the subjective control of emotion, accompanied byreductions of facial expressive activity (Corrugator supercilii and Zygomaticusmajor). ERP results indicated that distraction, compared with reappraisal,yielded a stronger and earlier attenuation of the late positive potential (LPP)magnitude for negative pictures. For positive pictures, only distraction but not reappraisal had significant effect on LPP attenuation. The results support theprocess model of ER, separating subtypes of cognitive strategies based on theirspecific time course.
 The activity and regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis has beenrelated to cognitive decline during aging. This study investigated whether thecortisol awakening response (CAR) is related to memory performance among olderadults. The sample was composed of 88 participants (44 men and 44 women) from 55 to 77 years old. The memory assessment consisted of two tests measuringdeclarative memory (a paragraph recall test and a word list learning test) andtwo tests measuring working memory (a spatial span test and a spatial workingmemory test). Among those participants who showed the CAR on two consecutivedays, we found that a greater CAR was related to poorer declarative memoryperformance in both men and women, and to better working memory performance only in men. The results of our study suggest that the relationship between CAR andmemory performance is negative in men and women when memory performance islargely dependent on hippocampal functioning (i.e. declarative memory), andpositive, but only in men, when memory performance is largely dependent onprefrontal cortex functioning (i.e. working memory).
 Self-disclosure is an important performance in human social communication.Generally, an individual is likely to have a good physical and mental health ifhe is prone to self-disclosure under stressful life events. However, as for now, little is known about the neural structure associated with self-disclosure.Therefore, in this study, we used voxel-based morphometry to explore regionalgray matter volume (rGMV) and white matter volume (rWMV) associated withself-disclosure measured by the Jourard Self-disclosure Questionnaire in a large sample of college students. Results showed that individual self-disclosure wassignificantly and positively associated with rGMV of the left postcentral gyrus, which might be related to strengthen individual's ability of body feeling; while self-disclosure was significantly and negatively associated with rGMV of theright orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which might be involved in increased positiveemotion experience seeking (intrinsically rewarding). In addition, individualself-disclosure was also associated with smaller rWMV in the right inferiorparietal lobule (IPL). These findings suggested a biological basis for individualself-disclosure, distributed across different gray and white matter areas of the brain.
 The human default mode network (DMN), comprising medial prefrontal cortex,precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, lateral parietal cortex, and medialtemporal cortex, is highly metabolically active at rest but deactivates duringmost focused cognitive tasks. The DMN and social cognitive networks overlapsignificantly in humans. We previously demonstrated that chimpanzees (Pantroglodytes) show highest resting metabolic brain activity in the corticalmidline areas of the human DMN. Human DMN is defined by task-induceddeactivations, not absolute resting metabolic levels; ergo, resting activity isinsufficient to define a DMN in chimpanzees. Here, we assessed the chimpanzeeDMN's deactivations relative to rest during cognitive tasks and the effect ofsocial content on these areas' activity. Chimpanzees performed a match-to-sample task with conspecific behavioral stimuli of varying sociality. Using [(18)F]-FDG PET, brain activity during these tasks was compared with activity during anonsocial task and at rest. Cortical midline areas in chimpanzees deactivated in these tasks relative to rest, suggesting a chimpanzee DMN anatomically andfunctionally similar to humans. Furthermore, when chimpanzees make socialdiscriminations, these same areas (particularly precuneus) are highly activerelative to nonsocial tasks, suggesting that, as in humans, the chimpanzee DMNmay play a role in social cognition.
 This study examined the effects of interpersonal similarity on vicarious errorprocessing. We predicted that high similarity between self and other wouldpredict increased neural responsiveness to the other's errors, based on theassumption that experience is more strongly shared when it involves similarothers. Participants observed a confederate performing a flanker task whileevent-related brain potentials were recorded from the observer. Physiologicaldata revealed two error-related potentials, the observational error-relatednegativity (oERN) and positivity (oPe). Self-reports of perceived similaritytoward the confederate predicted both components. Participants reporting higherinterpersonal similarity showed a larger oPe response to the other's errors,suggesting increased salience of errors committed by similar others.Unexpectedly, higher similarity also predicted a decreased oERN response.Divergent results for oERN and oPe may reflect the different functional roles of the two components. Together the results demonstrate that vicarious errormonitoring is sensitive to social factors.
 Usage of the term 'theory of mind' (ToM) has exploded across fields ranging from developmental psychology to social neuroscience and psychiatry research. However,its meaning is often vague and inconsistent, its biological bases are a subjectof debate, and the methods used to study it are highly heterogeneous. Mostcrucially, its original definition does not permit easy downward translation tomore basic processes such as those studied by behavioral neuroscience, leavingthe interpretation of neuroimaging results opaque. We argue for a reformulationof ToM through a systematic two-stage approach, beginning with a deconstructionof the construct into a comprehensive set of basic component processes, followed by a complementary reconstruction from which a scientifically tractable conceptof ToM can be recovered.
 Accumulating evidence from cognitive neuroscience indicates that the rightinferior parietal cortex, at the junction with the posterior temporal cortex,plays a critical role in various aspects of social cognition such as theory ofmind and empathy. With a quantitative meta-analysis of 70 functional neuroimagingstudies, the authors demonstrate that this area is also engaged in lower-level(bottom-up) computational processes associated with the sense of agency andreorienting attention to salient stimuli. It is argued that this domain-generalcomputational mechanism is crucial for higher level social cognitive processing.
 When choosing actions, humans have to balance carefully between different taskdemands. On the one hand, they should perform tasks repeatedly to avoid frequent and effortful switching between different tasks. On the other hand, subjects haveto retain their flexibility to adapt to changes in external task demands such as switching away from an increasingly difficult task. Here, we developed adifficulty-based choice task to investigate how subjects voluntarily selecttask-sets in predictably changing environments. Subjects were free to choose 1 ofthe 3 task-sets on a trial-by-trial basis, while the task difficulty changeddynamically over time. Subjects self-sequenced their behavior in this environmentwhile we measured brain responses with functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI). Using multivariate decoding, we found that task choices were encoded inthe medial prefrontal cortex (dorso-medial prefrontal cortex, dmPFC, and dorsalanterior cingulate cortex, dACC). The same regions were found to encode taskdifficulty, a major factor influencing choices. Importantly, the present paradigmallowed us to disentangle the neural code for task choices and task difficulty,ensuring that activation patterns in dmPFC/dACC independently encode these 2factors. This finding provides new evidence for the importance of the dmPFC/dACC for task-selection and motivational functions in highly dynamic environments.
 The utility of using indices of neural function to identify deception relies onfinding highly reliable and valid approaches that adequately identify the guilty and exonerate the innocent. A class of approaches, based on the guilty knowledge technique (GKT), assume that guilty individuals will recognize specificcrime-relevant details, whereas innocent individuals will not. Memorydistortions, however, may limit the accuracy of such procedures. To investigatethese limits, two studies were conducted to examine whether brain electricalactivity could differentiate true from false recollections elicited by theDeese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. The design of each study maximized theopportunity of finding electrocortical differences between true and falserecognition. Each study found very high rates of false recognition, with littleevidence that brain electrical activity could differentiate true from falsememories. Results suggested that under certain conditions both true and falserecollections can produce a pattern of brain activity indicative of recognition.
 Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying social conformity has recentlyadvanced due to the employment of neuroscience methodology and novel experimentalapproaches. Most prominently, several studies have demonstrated the role ofneural reinforcement-learning processes in conformal adjustments using aspecifically designed and frequently replicated paradigm. Only very recently, thevalidity of the critical behavioral effect in this very paradigm was seriouslyquestioned, as it invites the unwanted contribution of regression toward themean. Using a straightforward control-group design, we corroborate this recentfinding and demonstrate the involvement of statistical distortions. Additionally,however, we provide conclusive evidence that the paradigm nevertheless capturesbehavioral effects that can only be attributed to social influence. Finally, wepresent a mathematical approach that allows to isolate and quantify theparadigm's true conformity effect both at the group level and for each individualparticipant. These data as well as relevant theoretical considerations suggestthat the groundbreaking findings regarding the brain mechanisms of socialconformity that were obtained with this recently criticized paradigm were indeed valid. Moreover, we support earlier suggestions that distorted behavioral effectscan be rectified by means of appropriate correction procedures.
 Social exclusion evokes social pain in excluded individuals. Neuroimaging studiessuggest that this social pain is associated with activation of the dorsalanterior cingulate cortex (dACC), with further regulation of social pain beingreflected in activation of the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC).The present study focused on factors that influence activation of the rVLPFCduring social exclusion. We conducted a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)experiment to investigate whether two psychosocial resources (general trust andtrait self-esteem) increase rVLPFC activity during social exclusion, therebybuffering against social pain. Thirty-seven undergraduates participated in anNIRS session in which they were socially rejected during an online ball-tossinggame. Levels of general trust and trait self-esteem were negatively correlatedwith self-reported social pain in the exclusion conditions. Furthermore, general trust was positively correlated with rVLPFC activity, although there was no such relationship with self-esteem. rVLPFC activity mediated the relationship between general trust levels and social pain. The rVLPFC appears to be critical for theregulation of social pain. Taken together, these findings suggest that generaltrust and trait self-esteem probably have different impacts at different timesover the course of a series of adaptive processes, all geared toward themodulation of social pain.
 Many individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) have difficulty producing normalspeech and voice, resulting in problems with interpersonal communication andreduced quality of life. Translational animal models of communicative dysfunctionhave been developed to assess disease pathology. However, it is unknown whetheracoustic feature changes associated with vocal production deficits in theseanimal models lead to compromised communication. In rodents, male ultrasonicvocalizations (USVs) have a well-established role in functional inter-sexualcommunication. To test whether acoustic deficits in USVs observed in aPTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) knockout (KO) PD rat model compromisecommunication, we presented recordings of male PINK1 KO USVs and normal wild-type(WT) USVs to female rat listeners. We measured approached behavior and immediate early gene expression (c-Fos) in brain regions implicated in auditory processing and sexual motivation. Our results suggest that females show reduced approach in response to PINK1 KO USVs compared with WT. Moreover, females exposed to PINK1 KOUSVs had lower c-Fos immunolabeling in the nucleus accumbens, a region implicatedin sexual motivation. These results are the first to demonstrate thatvocalization deficits in a rat PD model result in compromised communication.Thus, the PINK1 KO PD model may be valuable for assessing treatments aimed atrestoring vocal communicative function.
 People often find it hard to disagree with others, but how this dispositionvaries across individuals or how it is influenced by social factors like otherpeople's level of expertise remains little understood. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found that activity across a network of brain areas [comprising posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC), anterior insula (AI),inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and angular gyrus]was modulated by individual differences in the frequency with which participants actively disagreed with statements made by others. Specifically, participants whodisagreed less frequently exhibited greater brain activation in these areas when they actually disagreed. Given the role of this network in cognitive dissonance, our results suggest that some participants had more trouble disagreeing due to a heightened cognitive dissonance response. Contrary to expectation, the level ofexpertise (high or low) had no effect on behavior or brain activity.
 Emotional deficits are part of the non-motor features of Parkinson's disease but few attention has been paid to specific aspects such as subjective emotionalexperience and autonomic responses. This study aimed to investigate themechanisms of emotional recognition in Parkinson's Disease (PD) using thefollowing levels: explicit evaluation of emotions (Self-Assessment Manikin) andimplicit reactivity (Skin Conductance Response; electromyographic measure offacial feedback of the zygomaticus and corrugator muscles). 20 PD Patients and 34healthy controls were required to observe and evaluate affective pictures during physiological parameters recording. In PD, the appraisal process on both valence and arousal features of emotional cues were preserved, but we found significantimpairment in autonomic responses. Specifically, in comparison to healthycontrols, PD patients revealed lower Skin Conductance Response values to negativeand high arousing emotional stimuli. In addition, the electromyographic measures showed defective responses exclusively limited to negative and high arousingemotional category: PD did not show increasing of corrugator activity in responseto negative emotions as happened in heathy controls. PD subjects inadequatelyrespond to the emotional categories which were considered more "salient": theyhad preserved appraisal process, but impaired automatic ability to distinguishbetween different emotional contexts.
 Like many other primates, humans place a high premium on social informationtransmission and processing. One important aspect of this information concernsthe emotional state of other individuals, conveyed by distinct visual cues suchas facial expressions, overt actions, or by cues extracted from the situationalcontext. A rich body of theoretical and empirical work has demonstrated thatthese socioemotional cues are processed by the human visual system in aprioritized fashion, in the service of optimizing social behavior. Furthermore,socioemotional perception is highly dependent on situational contexts andprevious experience. Here, we review current issues in this area of research and discuss the utility of the steady-state visual evoked potential (ssVEP) techniquefor addressing key empirical questions. Methodological advantages and caveats arediscussed with particular regard to quantifying time-varying competition amongmultiple perceptual objects, trial-by-trial analysis of visual corticalactivation, functional connectivity, and the control of low-level stimulusfeatures. Studies on facial expression and emotional scene processing aresummarized, with an emphasis on viewing faces and other social cues in emotional contexts, or when competing with each other. Further, because the ssVEP techniquecan be readily accommodated to studying the viewing of complex scenes withmultiple elements, it enables researchers to advance theoretical models ofsocioemotional perception, based on complex, quasinaturalistic viewingsituations.
 As a social species, humans rely on a safe, secure social surround to survive andthrive. Perceptions of social isolation, or loneliness, increase vigilance forthreat and heighten feelings of vulnerability while also raising the desire toreconnect. Implicit hypervigilance for social threat alters psychologicalprocesses that influence physiological functioning, diminish sleep quality, andincrease morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this paper is to review thefeatures and consequences of loneliness within a comprehensive theoreticalframework that informs interventions to reduce loneliness. We review physical andmental health consequences of loneliness, mechanisms for its effects, andeffectiveness of extant interventions. Features of a loneliness regulatory loopare employed to explain cognitive, behavioral, and physiological consequences of loneliness and to discuss interventions to reduce loneliness. Loneliness is notsimply being alone. Interventions to reduce loneliness and its healthconsequences may need to take into account its attentional, confirmatory, andmemorial biases as well as its social and behavioral effects.
 According to the differential reactivity hypothesis, lonely individuals responddifferently to their environment compared to nonlonely individuals, which maysustain their loneliness levels. However, this interesting hypothesis has not yetbeen explored in daily life: Do lonely individuals feel lonely all the time, ordo they feel more or less lonely in specific social contexts? The main aim of thepresent study was to test the differential reactivity hypothesis in daily life byexamining in three samples whether trait levels of loneliness affected the levelsof state loneliness in different social contexts. We used baseline questionnairesto measure trait loneliness and the Experience Sampling Method to collect data onstate loneliness, in early adolescents (N = 269, Mage = 14.49, 59% female) andlate adolescents (N = 223, Mage = 19.60, 91% female) from the Netherlands andlate adolescents from the United States (N = 126, Mage = 19.20, 51% female).Results provided evidence for the differential reactivity hypothesis in the totalsample, as high lonely adolescents experienced higher levels of state loneliness in situations in which they were alone than low lonely adolescents, but alsobenefited more from being with intimate company than low lonely adolescents. Insum, the present study provided evidence for the differential reactivityhypothesis and showed that the experience of loneliness in daily life wasremarkably similar across age and culture. Our findings provide importantinsights into the daily experiences of trait lonely people, which may providestarting points for interventions.
 In this study, to investigate the influence of incidental emotions on decisionmaking in high-anxious individuals, participants were required to perform amonetary gambling task. Behavioral and electroencephalography responses wererecorded to explore the stages of option assessment and outcome evaluation duringdecision making, respectively. Incidental emotions were elicited by facialexpression pictures presented on the background, which included four conditions(control, neutral, fearful, and happy). Results showed smaller feedback-relatednegativity (FRN) amplitudes in high-anxious participants than low-anxiousparticipants in the control, neutral, and fearful conditions, but not in thehappy condition, for small outcomes. The P3 amplitudes were larger inhigh-anxious participants compared to their counterparts in the fearful and happyconditions, but not in the other conditions. In short, the interaction effectsbetween trait anxiety and facial emotions manifested on the outcome evaluationstage of decision making.
 Past research shows that self-control is limited and becomes depleted afterinitial exertions. This study examined the neural processes underlyingself-control failure by testing whether controlled, effortful behavior impairssubsequent attempts at control by depleting the neural system associated withconflict monitoring. Subjects either watched an emotional movie normally or triedto suppress their emotions while watching the movie; they then completed anostensibly unrelated Stroop task while electroencephalographic activity wasrecorded. The error-related negativity (ERN)--a waveform associated with activityin the anterior cingulate--was measured to determine whether prior regulatoryexertion constrained the conflict-monitoring system. Compared with subjects inthe control condition, those who suppressed their emotions performed worse on theStroop task, and this deficit was mediated by weaker ERN signals. These resultsoffer a neural account for the self-regulatory-strength model and demonstrate theutility of the social neuroscience approach.
 In order to determine if highly negative stigma is a more salient cue than other negative emotional, non-stigmatized cues, participants underwentelectroencephalography while passively viewing or actively regulating theiremotional response to images of highly negative stigmatized (e.g., homelessindividuals, substance abusers) or highly negative non-stigmatized (e.g., a manholding a gun, an injured person) individuals. Event-related potential (ERP)analyses focused on the N2 (associated with detecting novelty), the earlypositive potential (associated with processing emotion), and a sustained latepositive potential (associated with modulating regulatory goals). A salienceeffect for highly negative stigma was revealed in the early positive potential,with higher magnitude ERP responses to images of highly negative stigmatized ascompared to highly negative non-stigmatized individuals 355 ms poststimulusonset. Moreover, the amplitude of this effect was predicted by individualdifferences in implicit bias. Our results also demonstrated that the latepositivity response was not modulated by regulatory goals (passively view versus to reappraise) for images of highly negative stigmatized individuals, but was forimages of highly negative, non-stigmatized individuals (replicating previousfindings). Our findings suggest that the neural response to highly negativestigma is salient and rigid.
 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neurologists have generally paid relatively little attentionto social behavior and its disorders. As a result, many individuals withsuspected brain disorders primarily involving changes in social behavior havesought evaluations by psychiatrists or psychologists. This review summarizesrecent findings from the growing field of social neuroscience and illustrates therelevance of this knowledge for the neurologist by reviewing contemporaryresearch on frontotemporal dementia and its differential diagnosis. RECENTFINDINGS: An explosion of research over the past 10 to 15 years has illuminatedspecific psychological processes involved in core facets of social behavior andtheir neural bases. In parallel, knowledge of the genetics, neurobiology,neuroimaging features, and clinical phenomenology of frontotemporal dementia has grown dramatically. SUMMARY: As the understanding of specific component processesinvolved in social behavior and their neural underpinnings deepen, neurologistsmay lead the way in using this knowledge to provide sophisticated evaluation and monitoring for patients with disorders of social behavior and ultimately maydevelop new therapeutic options to treat these brain disorders.
 The mirror neuron system has been suggested to play a role in many socialcapabilities such as action understanding, imitation, language and empathy. Theseare all capabilities that develop during infancy and childhood, but the humanmirror neuron system has been poorly studied using neurophysiological measures.This study measured the brain activity of 6-month-old infants and adults using a high-density EEG net with the aim of identifying mirror neuron activity. Thesubjects viewed both goal-directed movements and non-goal-directed movements. An independent component analysis was used to extract the sources of cognitiveprocesses. The desynchronization of the mu rhythm in adults has been shown to be a marker for activation of the mirror neuron system and was used as a criterionto categorize independent components between subjects. The results showedsignificant mu desynchronization in the adult group and significantly higher ERP activation in both adults and 6-month-olds for the goal-directed actionobservation condition. This study demonstrate that infants as young as 6 monthsdisplay mirror neuron activity and is the first to present a direct ERP measureof the mirror neuron system in infants.
 Psychosocial stressors appear to promote the onset of depressive illness through activation and sensitization of inflammatory mechanisms. Here, adult male rhesus monkeys brought from large outdoor social groups to indoor housing for 8 daysreliably exhibited a hunched, depressive-like posture. When rehoused indoors asecond 8 days about 2 weeks later, monkeys housed alone, but not those with anaffiliative partner, showed sensitization of the depressive-like hunched posture.Housing indoors also affected circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL-1betashowed increased responsiveness to immune challenge, and IL-1beta and TNF-alphashowed reduced suppression by dexamethasone. Sensitivity of the anti-inflammatorycytokine IL-10 to immune challenge exhibited a relative increase from the firstto the second round of indoor housing in animals housed in pairs, and a relative decrease in animals housed alone. Cytokine levels during indoor housing werepositively correlated with duration of depressive-like behavior. Plasma cortisol levels increased but did not differentiate housing conditions or rounds. Results demonstrate a rapid induction and sensitization of depressive-like behavior toindoor individual housing, social buffering of sensitization, and associatedinflammatory responses. This paradigm may provide a practical nonhuman primatemodel for examining inflammatory-mediated consequences of psychosocial stressors on depression and possible social buffering of these effects.
 Helping behavior is motivated by empathic concern for others in distress.Although empathic concern is pervasive in daily life, its neural mechanismsremain unclear. Empathic concern involves the suppression of the emotionalresponse to others' distress, which occurs when individuals distance themselvesemotionally from the distressed individual. We hypothesized that helping behaviorinduced by empathic concern, accompanied by perspective-taking, would attenuatethe neural activation representing aversive feelings. We also predicted rewardsystem activation due to the positive feeling resulting from helping behavior.Participant underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while playing avirtual ball-toss game. In some blocks ("concern condition"), one player("isolated player") did not receive ball-tosses from other players. In thiscondition, participants increased ball-tosses to the isolated player (helpingbehavior). Participants then evaluated the improved enjoyment of the isolatedplayer resulting from their helping behavior. Anterior cingulate activationduring the concern condition was attenuated by the evaluation of the effect ofhelping behavior. The right temporoparietal junction, which is involved inperspective-taking and the dorsal striatum, part of the reward system, were also activated during the concern condition. These results suggest that humans canattenuate affective arousal by anticipating the positive outcome of empathicconcern through perspective-taking.
 Social and decision-making deficits are often the first symptoms of a strikingnumber of neurodegenerative disorders associated with aging. These includes notonly disorders that directly impact dopamine and basal ganglia, such asParkinson's disorder, but also degeneration in which multiple neural pathways areaffected over the course of normal aging. The impact of such deficits can bedramatic, as in cases of financial fraud, which disproportionately affect theelderly. Unlike memory and motor impairments, however, which are readilyrecognized as symptoms of more serious underlying neurological conditions, socialand decision-making deficits often do not elicit comparable concern in theelderly. Furthermore, few behavioral measures exist to quantify these deficits,due in part to our limited knowledge of the core cognitive components or theirneurobiological substrates. Here we probe age-related differences indecision-making using a game theory paradigm previously shown to dissociatecontributions of basal ganglia and prefrontal regions to behavior. Combined with computational modeling, we provide evidence that age-related changes in elderlyparticipants are driven primarily by an over-reliance in trial-and-errorreinforcement learning that does not take into account the strategic context,which may underlie cognitive deficits that contribute to social vulnerability in elderly individuals.
 Can event-related electro-encephalogram (EEG) responses provide support for theoccurrence of spontaneous trait inferences (STI)? Participants read sentencesdescribing the behavior of a target person from which a strong trait could beinferred. The last word of each sentence determined the consistency with thetrait induced during an introductory paragraph. In comparison with sentences thatwere consistent with the implied trait, when the sentences were inconsistent, an event-related P300 waveform was observed at parietal scalp regions (Pz). Thisdependency on behavioral consistency indicates that trait inferences were madespontaneously. Memory measures taken after the presentation of the stimulusmaterial involved sentence completion and trait-cued recall, and also supportedthe occurrence of spontaneously inferred traits associated with the actor.Interestingly, increased memory for consistent relative to inconsistent behaviorsat the trait-cued recall task was significantly correlated with the P300, whichsupports this latter measure as a valid neural correlate of spontaneous traitinferences.
 Studying the way athletes predict actions of their peers during fast-ball sports,such as a tennis, has proved to be a valuable tool for increasing our knowledgeof intention understanding. The working model in this area is that theanticipatory representations of others' behaviors require internal predictivemodels of actions formed from pre-established and shared representations between the observer and the actor. This model also predicts that observers would not be able to read accurately the intentions of a competitor if the competitor were to perform the action without prior knowledge of their intention until momentsbefore the action. To test this hypothesis, we recorded brain activity from 25male tennis players while they performed a novel behavioral tennis intentioninference task, which included two conditions: (i) one condition in which theyviewed video clips of a tennis athlete who knew in advance where he was about to act/serve (initially intended serves) and (ii) one condition in which they viewedvideo clips of that same athlete when he did not know where he was to act/serveuntil the target was specified after he had tossed the ball into the air tocomplete his serve (non-initially intended serves). Our results demonstrated that(i) tennis expertise is related to the accuracy in predicting where anotherserver intends to serve when that server knows where he intends to serve before(but not after) he tosses the ball in the air; and (ii) accurate predictions are characterized by the recruitment of both cortical areas within the human mirrorneuron system (that is known to be involved in higher-order (top-down) processes of embodied cognition and shared representation) and subcortical areas withinbrain regions involved in procedural memory (caudate nucleus). Interestingly,inaccurate predictions instead recruit areas known to be involved in low-level(bottom-up) computational processes associated with the sense of agency andself-other distinction.
 Loneliness is prevalent in adolescents. Although it can be a normativeexperience, children and adolescents who experience loneliness are often at risk for anxiety, depression, and suicide. Research efforts have been made to identifythe neurobiological basis of such distressful feelings in our social brain. Inadolescents, the social brain is still undergoing significant development, which may contribute to their increased and differential sensitivity to the socialenvironment. Many behavioral studies have shown the significance of attachmentsecurity and social skills in adolescents' interactions with the social world. Inthis review, we propose a developmental social neuroscience model that extendsfrom the social neuroscience model of loneliness. In particular, we argue thatthe social brain and social skills are both important for the development ofadolescents' perceived loneliness and that adolescents' familial attachment sets the baseline for neurobiological development. By reviewing the related behavioraland neuroimaging literature, we propose a developmental social neuroscience modelto explain the heightened perception of loneliness in adolescents using socialskills and attachment style as neurobiological moderators. We encourage futureresearchers to investigate adolescents' perceived social connectedness from thedevelopmental neuroscience perspective.
 Anxiety disorders are characterized by hyperactivity in both the amygdala and theanterior insula. Interventions that normalize activity in these areas maytherefore be effective in treating anxiety disorders. Recently, there has beensignificant interest in the potential use of oxytocin (OT), as well asvasopressin (AVP) antagonists, as treatments for anxiety disorders. In thisdouble-blind, placebo-controlled, pharmaco- fMRI study, 153 men and 151 womenwere randomized to treatment with either 24 IU intranasal OT, 20 IU intranasalAVP, or placebo and imaged with fMRI as they played the iterated Prisoner'sDilemma game with same-sex human and computer partners. In men, OT attenuated thefMRI response to unreciprocated cooperation (CD), a negative social interaction, within the amygdala and anterior insula. This effect was specific to interactionswith human partners. In contrast, among women, OT unexpectedly attenuated theamygdala and anterior insula response to unreciprocated cooperation from computerbut not human partners. Among women, AVP did not significantly modulate theresponse to unreciprocated cooperation in either the amygdala or the anteriorinsula. However, among men, AVP attenuated the BOLD response to CD outcomes with human partners across a relatively large cluster including the amygdala and theanterior insula, which was contrary to expectations. Our results suggest that OT may decrease the stress of negative social interactions among men, whereas these effects were not found in women interacting with human partners. These findingssupport continued investigation into the possible efficacy of OT as a treatmentfor anxiety disorders.
 In recent years there has been a growing interest in the use of social networkanalysis in biobehavioral research. Despite the well-established importance ofsocial relationships in influencing human behavior and health, little is knownabout how children's perception of their immediate social relationshipscorrelates with biological parameters of stress. In this study we explore theassociation between two measures of children's personal social networks,perceived network size and perceived network density, with two biomarkers ofstress, cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase. Forty children (mean age = 8.30, minage = 5, and max age = 12) were interviewed to collect information about theirfriendships and three samples of saliva were collected. Our results show thatchildren characterized by a lower pre-interview cortisol concentration and alower salivary alpha-amylase reactivity to the interview reported the highestdensity of friendships. We discuss this result in light of the multisystemapproach to the study of children's behavioral outcomes, emphasizing that future work of this kind is needed in order to understand the cognitive and biologicalmechanisms underlying children's and adolescents' social perceptual biases.
 The popular drug 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, "Ecstasy", "the LoveDrug") produces feelings of love and closeness in humans and induces analogousprosocial and antiaggressive effects in laboratory animals. Here we examined the specific brain regions that may be involved in these prosocial effects. MaleWistar rats were pretreated with a moderate dose of MDMA (5 mg/kg) or vehicle andthen either kept alone in a familiar test chamber for 60 min (groups MDMA-ALONEand VEHICLE-ALONE) or allowed to engage in social interaction in the familiartest chamber with an unfamiliar same-sex conspecific for 60 min (groupsMDMA-SOCIAL and VEHICLE-SOCIAL). Rats in the MDMA-SOCIAL group showed muchgreater overall social interaction than rats in the VEHICLE-SOCIAL group, withmicroanalysis revealing increased general investigation of other rats butdecreased anogenital sniffing. Analysis of neural activation across 39 brainregions using Fos immunohistochemistry showed the following results: (1)VEHICLE-SOCIAL and VEHICLE-ALONE groups did not differ in Fos expression,indicating that a social context per se did not affect Fos expression, (2)MDMA-treated groups showed significantly increased Fos expression relative toVEHICLE treated groups in 30 brain regions, (3) the MDMA-SOCIAL group showedaugmented Fos expression relative to the MDMA-ALONE group in six brain regionsincluding the caudate-putamen (medial), medial preoptic area, paraventricularthalamic nucleus, central amygdala, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, and themedial amygdala (posterodorsal), and (4) the MDMA-SOCIAL group (but not theMDMA-ALONE group) showed augmented Fos expression relative to the VEHICLE groups in the nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area and periaqueductal grey. Theseresults indicate that a moderate dose of MDMA given in a social context causesconsiderably greater brain activation than the same dose given to solitary rats. This activation involves specific neural circuits that are known to regulateaffiliative behavior, perhaps by modulating the incentive value of socialstimuli. A possible role for the neuropeptide oxytocin in mediating the prosocialeffects of MDMA is discussed.
 Limited information is available regarding predictors of psychosocialdifficulties in children following stroke. This study aimed to (i) compare socialcompetence of children with arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) to those with chronic illness and healthy controls and (ii) investigate the contribution of strokepathology, neurological outcome and environment. Thirty-six children with AIS >12 months prior to recruitment were compared with children with chronic illness(asthma) (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 43). Children underwent intellectual assessment, and children and parents completed questionnaires to assess socialcompetence. Children with AIS underwent MRI scan and neurological evaluation.Child AIS was associated with poorer social adjustment and participation, andchildren with AIS were rated as having more social problems than controls. Lesionvolume was not associated with social outcome, but subcortical stroke was linked to reduced social participation and younger stroke onset predicted better social interaction and higher self-esteem. Family function was the sole predictor ofsocial adjustment. Findings highlight the risk of social impairment followingpediatric stroke, with both stroke and environmental factors influencingchildren's social competence in the chronic stages of recovery. They indicate thepotential for intervention targeting support at the family level.
 When movements indicate meaningful actions, even nonbiological objects induce theimpression of "having a mind" or animacy. This basic social ability wasinvestigated in adults with high-functioning autism (HFA, n = 13, and matchedcontrols, n = 13) by systematically varying motion properties of simple geometricshapes. Critically, trial-by-trial variations of (1) motion complexity ofstimuli, and of (2) participants' individual animacy ratings were separatelycorrelated with neural activity to dissociate cognitive strategies relying moreclosely on stimulus analysis vs. subjective experience. Increasing motioncomplexity did not yield any significant group differences, and in both groups,it correlated with neural activity in regions involved in perceptual andevaluative processing, including the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC),superior temporal gyrus (STG) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). In contrast, although there were no significant behavioral differences between the groups,increasing animacy ratings correlated with neural activity in the insula, STG,amygdala, dorsal mPFC and PCC more strongly in controls than in HFA. Theseresults indicate that in HFA the evaluation of stimulus properties cuing foranimacy is intact, while increasing subjective ratings do not seem to be robustlyrelated to social processing, including spontaneous mental state inferences andexperience of salience.
 Conflict is a ubiquitous feature of interpersonal relationships, yet many ofthese relationships preserve their value following conflict. Our ability torefrain from punishment despite the occurrence of conflict is a characteristic ofhuman beings. Using a combination of behavioral and neuroimaging techniques, weshow that prosocial decision-making is modulated by relationship closeness. In aniterated social exchange, participants were more likely to cooperate with theirpartner compared to an unknown person by accepting unfair exchanges. Importantly,this effect was not influenced by how resources were actually being shared withone's partner. The medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) was activated when thepartner, rather than the unknown person, behaved unfairly and, in the samecontext, the MPFC demonstrated greater functional connectivity with the dorsalanterior cingulate cortex (DACC). MPFC-DACC connectivity was inversely associatedwith participants' tendency to "forgive" their partner for unfairness as well as performance outside the scanner on a behavioral measure of forgiveness. Weconclude that relationship closeness modulates a neural network comprising theMPFC/DACC during economic exchanges.
 Humans from a very early age are deeply sensitive to issues of justice andfairness, both in their own lives and in the lives of others. Most people arehighly motivated to pursue justice and condemn injustice. Where does this concernfor justice come from? Here we integrate findings in evolution, development,psychology, behavioral economics, and social neuroscience to highlight multiplepotential drivers of justice motivation. We argue that justice motivation arises from complementary rapid heuristics and deliberation, each utilizing distinct andinteracting neural circuitry. This framework is useful for explaining observedsymmetries and asymmetries in responses to experiencing or observing injusticeand may help to explain why individuals vary in their responses to injustice.
 A large proportion of human social neuroscience research has focused on the issueof decision-making. Impaired decision-making is a symptomatic feature of a numberof neurodegenerative diseases, but the nature of these decision-making deficitsdepends on the particular disease. Thus, examining the qualitative differences indecision-making impairments associated with different neurodegenerative diseases could provide valuable information regarding the underlying neural basis ofdecision-making. Nevertheless, few comparative reports of decision-making across patient groups exist. In this Review, we examine the neuroanatomical substratesof decision-making in relation to the neuropathological changes that occur inAlzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson disease and Huntingtondisease. We then examine the main findings from studies of decision-making inthese neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we suggest a number of recommendationsthat future studies could adopt to aid our understanding of decision-makingcognition.
 The present research explored the effect of social empathy on processingemotional facial expressions. Previous evidence suggested a close relationshipbetween emotional empathy and both the ability to detect facial emotions and the attentional mechanisms involved. A multi-measure approach was adopted: weinvestigated the association between trait empathy (Balanced Emotional EmpathyScale) and individuals' performance (response times; RTs), attentional mechanisms(eye movements; number and duration of fixations), correlates of corticalactivation (event-related potential (ERP) N200 component), and facialresponsiveness (facial zygomatic and corrugator activity). Trait empathy wasfound to affect face detection performance (reduced RTs), attentional processes(more scanning eye movements in specific areas of interest), ERP salience effect (increased N200 amplitude), and electromyographic activity (more facialresponses). A second important result was the demonstration of strong, directcorrelations among these measures. We suggest that empathy may function as asocial facilitator of the processes underlying the detection of facial emotion,and a general "facial response effect" is proposed to explain these results. Weassumed that empathy influences cognitive and the facial responsiveness, suchthat empathic individuals are more skilful in processing facial emotion.
 Self-face recognition is crucial for sense of identity and self-awareness.Finding self-face recognition disorders mainly in neurological and psychiatricdiseases suggests that modifying sense of identity in a simple, rapid way remainsa "holy grail" for cognitive neuroscience. By touching the face of subjects whowere viewing simultaneous touches on a partner's face, we induced a novelillusion of personal identity that we call "enfacement": The partner's facialfeatures became incorporated into the representation of the participant's ownface. Subjects reported that morphed images of themselves and their partnercontained more self than other only after synchronous, but not asynchronous,stroking. Therefore, we modified self-face recognition by means of a simplepsychophysical manipulation. While accommodating gradual change in one's own faceis an important form of representational plasticity that may help maintainingidentity over time, the surprisingly rapid changes induced by our proceduresuggest that sense of facial identity may be more malleable than previouslybelieved. "Enfacement" correlated positively with the participant's empathictraits and with the physical attractiveness the participants attributed to their partners. Thus, personality variables modulate enfacement, which may represent a marker of the tendency to be social and may be absent in subjects with defective empathy.
 The capacity and motivation to be social is a key component of the human adaptivebehavioral repertoire. Recent research has identified social behaviors remarkablysimilar to our own in other animals, including empathy, consolation, cooperation,and strategic deception. Moreover, neurobiological studies in humans, nonhumanprimates, and rodents have identified shared brain structures (the so-called'social brain') apparently specialized to mediate such functions. Neuromodulatorsmay regulate social interactions by 'tuning' the social brain, with importantimplications for treating social impairments. Here, we survey recent findings in social neuroscience from a comparative perspective, and conclude that the verysocial behaviors that make us human emerge from mechanisms shared widely withother animals, as well as some that appear to be unique to humans and otherprimates.
 Research on empathy in schizophrenia has relied on dated self-report scales that do not conform to contemporary social neuroscience models of empathy. The currentstudy evaluated the structure and correlates of the recently-developedQuestionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE) in schizophrenia. Thismeasure, whose structure and validity was established in healthy individuals,includes separate scales to assess the two main components of empathy: Cognitive Empathy (assessed by two subscales) and Affective Empathy (assessed by threesubscales). Stable outpatients with schizophrenia (n = 145) and healthyindividuals (n = 45) completed the QCAE, alternative measures of empathy, andassessments of clinical symptoms, neurocognition, and functional outcome.Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses provided consistent support for atwo-factor solution in the schizophrenia group, justifying the use of separatecognitive and affective empathy scales in this population. However, one of thethree Affective Empathy subscales was not psychometrically sound and was excludedfrom further analyses. Patients reported significantly lower Cognitive Empathybut higher Affective Empathy than controls. Among patients, the QCAE scalesshowed significant correlations with an alternative self-report empathy scale,but not with performance on an empathic accuracy task. The QCAE Cognitive Empathysubscales also showed significant, though modest, correlations with negativesymptoms and functional outcome. These findings indicate that structure ofself-reported empathy is similar in people with schizophrenia and healthysubjects, and can be meaningfully compared between groups. They also contributeto emerging evidence that some aspects of empathy may be intact orhyper-responsive in schizophrenia.
 Loneliness is a complex set of feelings encompassing reactions to unfulfilledintimate and social needs. Although transient for some individuals, lonelinesscan be a chronic state for others. Prior research has shown that loneliness is a major risk factor for psychological disturbances and for broad-based morbidityand mortality. We examined differences between lonely and socially embeddedindividuals that might explain differences in health outcomes. Satisfying social relationships were associated with more positive outlooks on life, more secureattachments and interactions with others, more autonomic activation whenconfronting acute psychological challenges, and more efficient restorativebehaviors. Individuals who were chronically lonely were characterized by elevatedmean salivary cortisol levels across the course of a day, suggesting moredischarges of corticotropin-releasing hormone and elevated activation of thehypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocorticol axis. An experimental manipulation ofloneliness further suggested that the way in which people construe their self in relation to others around them has powerful effects on their self concept and,possibly, on their physiology.
 Faces are key social stimuli that convey a wealth of information essential forperson perception and adaptive interpersonal behaviour. Studies in the domain of cognitive, affective, and social neuroscience have put in light that theprocessing of faces recruits specific visual regions and activates a distributed set of brain regions related to attentional, emotional, social, and memoryprocesses associated with the perception of faces and the extraction of thenumerous information attached to them. Studies using neuroimaging techniques suchas functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have allowed localizing thesebrain regions and characterizing their functional properties.Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) techniques arecomplementary to fMRI in that they offer a unique insight into the temporaldynamics of mental processes. In this article, I review the contribution ofneuroimaging techniques to the knowledge on face processing and person perceptionwith the aim of putting in light the extended influence of experience-relatedfactors, particularly in relation with emotions, on the face processing system.Although the face processing network has evolved under evolutionary selectionpressure related to sociality-related needs and is therefore highly conservedthroughout the human species, neuroimaging studies put in light both theextension and the flexibility of the brain network involved in face processing.MEG and EEG allow in particular to reveal that the human brain integratesemotion- and experience-related information from the earliest stage of faceprocessing. Altogether, this emphasizes the diversity of social cognitiveprocesses associated with face perception.
 Philosophers have proposed that laypeople can have deterministic orindeterministic intuitions about the relationship between free will and moralresponsibility. However, the psychophysiological mechanisms that generate theseextreme intuitions are still underexplored. Exogenous oxytocin offers a uniqueopportunity to gain a deeper understanding of these underlying mechanisms, since this neuropeptide influences a wide range of outcomes related to social cognitionand prosociality. This study investigated the effects of intranasal oxytocin onintuitions about the relationship between free will and moral responsibility byapplying a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subject design. Healthy male participants rated the moral responsibility of a hypotheticaloffender, who committed crimes in either a primed deterministic or anindeterministic universe. Under placebo, participants held the offender moremorally responsible when acting in an indeterministic compared to a deterministicuniverse, which could be accredited to recognition of the offender's freelychosen action to commit the crimes. Under oxytocin, participants rated theoffender's actions with greater leniency and similarly assigned lower moralresponsibility in both universes. These findings strengthen the assumption that aperson can have different intuitions about the relationship between free will andmoral responsibility, which can be presumably dependent on motivational statesassociated with affiliation.
 Computational approaches have great potential for moving neuroscience towardmechanistic models of the functional integration among brain regions. Dynamiccausal modeling (DCM) offers a promising framework for inferring the effectiveconnectivity among brain regions and thus unraveling the neural mechanisms ofboth normal cognitive function and psychiatric disorders. While the benefit ofsuch approaches depends heavily on their reliability, systematic analyses of the within-subject stability are rare. Here, we present a thorough investigation ofthe test-retest reliability of an fMRI paradigm for DCM analysis dedicated tounraveling intra- and interhemispheric integration among the core regions of the face perception network. First, we examined the reliability of face-specific BOLDactivity in 25 healthy volunteers, who performed a face perception paradigm intwo separate sessions. We found good to excellent reliability of BOLD activitywithin the DCM-relevant regions. Second, we assessed the stability of effectiveconnectivity among these regions by analyzing the reliability of Bayesian modelselection and model parameter estimation in DCM. Reliability was excellent forthe negative free energy and good for model parameter estimation, whenrestricting the analysis to parameters with substantial effect sizes. Third, evenwhen the experiment was shortened, reliability of BOLD activity and DCM resultsdropped only slightly as a function of the length of the experiment. Thissuggests that the face perception paradigm presented here provides reliableestimates for both conventional activation and effective connectivity measures.We conclude this paper with an outlook on potential clinical applications of the paradigm for studying psychiatric disorders.

 The misfortunes of enviable individuals are met by observers with pleasurewhereas those of "average", non-enviable individuals elicit pain. These responsesare mirrored in deservingness judgments, as enviable individuals' misfortunes areperceived as deserved and those of non-enviable individuals perceived asundeserved. However, the neural underpinnings of these deservingness disparities remain unknown. To explore this phenomenon, we utilized fMRI to test thehypotheses that (A) non-enviable targets' misfortunes would be associated withactivation of brain regions that mediate empathic responding (pain matrix,mentalizing network) and not for enviable targets and (B) that activation ofthose regions would predict decreases in deservingness judgments. Supporting our first hypothesis, the misfortunes of non-enviable targets (as opposed to goodfortunes) were associated with activation of the mentalizing network: medialprefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, temporal-parietal junction, andanterior temporal lobes. Supporting our second hypothesis, dorsomedial prefrontalcortex activation from this contrast was negatively correlated with subsequentreports of how much the non-enviable target deserved his/her misfortune. Thesefindings suggest that non-enviable individuals' misfortunes are perceived asunjust due, in part, to the recruitment of the mentalizing network.
 Few aspects of human cognition are more personal than the choices we make. Ourdecisions - from the mundane to the impossibly complex - continually shape thecourses of our lives. In recent years, researchers have applied the tools ofneuroscience to understand the mechanisms that underlie decision making, as part of the new discipline of decision neuroscience. A primary goal of this emergingfield has been to identify the processes that underlie specific decisionvariables, including the value of rewards, the uncertainty associated withparticular outcomes, and the consequences of social interactions. Recent worksuggests potential neural substrates that integrate these variables, potentially reflecting a common neural currency for value, to facilitate value comparisons.Despite the successes of decision neuroscience research for elucidating brainmechanisms, significant challenges remain. These include building new conceptual frameworks for decision making, integrating research findings across disparatetechniques and species, and extending results from neuroscience to shape economictheory. To overcome these challenges, future research will likely focus oninterpersonal variability in decision making, with the eventual goal of creating biologically plausible models for individual choice.
 The present experiment tested the hypothesis that neonatal injury disrupts adult hippocampal functioning and that normal aging or chronic stress during adulthood,which are known to have a negative impact on hippocampal function, exacerbatethese effects. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were given an intraplantarinjection of the inflammatory agent carrageenan (1%) on the day of birth andtheir memory was tested in the hippocampal-dependent spatial water maze inadulthood and again in middle age. We found that neonatal injury impairedhippocampal-dependent memory in adulthood, that the effects of injury on memorywere more pronounced in middle-aged male rats, and that chronic stressaccelerated the onset of these memory deficits. Neonatal injury also decreasedglucocorticoid receptor mRNA in the dorsal CA1 area of middle-aged rats, a brain region critical for spatial memory. Morphine administration at the time of injurycompletely reversed injury-induced memory deficits, but neonatal morphinetreatments in the absence of injury produced significant memory impairments inadulthood. Collectively, these findings are consistent with our hypothesis thatneonatal injury produces long-lasting disruption in adult hippocampalfunctioning.
 This study examined the neural substrates of facial familiarity andperson-knowledge. Based on current neural models of face perception, it washypothesized that distinct extended networks of brain regions differentiate theperception of (a) novel faces, (b) novel faces associated with person-knowledge, (c) perceptually familiar faces and (d) familiar faces for which person-knowledgewas learned. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an event-related functionalmagnetic resonance imaging experiment during which participants viewed facesexperimentally manipulated to represent these different levels of familiarity.Results confirmed that distinct networks of brain regions, particularly themedial prefrontal cortex, underlie the perception of faces for whichperson-knowledge is available.
 The hippocampus is composed of distinct anatomical subregions that participate inmultiple cognitive processes and are differentially affected in prevalentneurological and psychiatric conditions. Advances in high-field MRI allow for thenon-invasive identification of hippocampal substructure. These approaches,however, demand time-consuming manual segmentation that relies heavily onanatomical expertise. Here, we share manual labels and associated high-resolutionMRI data (MNI-HISUB25; submillimetric T1- and T2-weighted images, detailedsequence information, and stereotaxic probabilistic anatomical maps) based on 25 healthy subjects. Data were acquired on a widely available 3 Tesla MRI systemusing a 32 phased-array head coil. The protocol divided the hippocampal formationinto three subregions: subicular complex, merged Cornu Ammonis 1, 2 and 3 (CA1-3)subfields, and CA4-dentate gyrus (CA4-DG). Segmentation was guided by consistent intensity and morphology characteristics of the densely myelinated molecularlayer together with few geometry-based boundaries flexible to overallmesiotemporal anatomy, and achieved excellent intra-/inter-rater reliability(Dice index >/=90/87%). The dataset can inform neuroimaging assessments of themesiotemporal lobe and help to develop segmentation algorithms relevant for basicand clinical neurosciences.
 Activation of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) neurons in theparaventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) is necessary for establishingthe classic endocrine response to stress, while activation of forebrain CRFneurons mediates affective components of the stress response. Previous studieshave reported that mRNA for CRF2 receptor (CRFR2) is expressed in the bed nucleusof the stria terminalis (BNST) as well as hypothalamic nuclei, but little isknown about the localization and cellular distribution of CRFR2 in these regions.Using immunofluorescence with confocal microscopy, as well as electronmicroscopy, we demonstrate that in the BNST CRFR2-immunoreactive fibers representmoderate to strong labeling on axons terminals. Dual-immunofluorescencedemonstrated that CRFR2-fibers co-localize oxytocin (OT), but notarginine-vasopressin (AVP), and make perisomatic contacts with CRF neurons.Dual-immunofluorescence and single cell RT-PCR demonstrate that in thehypothalamus, CRFR2 immunoreactivity and mRNA are found in OT, but not in CRF or AVP-neurons. Furthermore, CRF neurons of the PVN and BNST express mRNA for theoxytocin receptor, while the majority of OT/CRFR2 neurons in the hypothalamus do not. Finally, using adenoviral-based anterograde tracing of PVN neurons, we show that OT/CRFR2-immunoreactive fibers observed in the BNST originate in the PVN.Our results strongly suggest that CRFR2 located on oxytocinergic neurons and axonterminals might regulate the release of this neuropeptide and hence might be acrucial part of potential feedback loop between the hypothalamic oxytocin system and the forebrain CRF system that could significantly impact affective and socialbehaviors, in particular during times of stress.
 The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is an important primate model for socialcognition, and recent studies have begun to explore the impact of oxytocin onsocial cognition and behavior. Macaques have great potential for elucidating the neural mechanisms by which oxytocin modulates social cognition, which hasimplications for oxytocin-based pharmacotherapies for psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Previous attempts to localize oxytocin receptors(OXTR) in the rhesus macaque brain have failed due to reduced selectivity ofradioligands, which in primates bind to both OXTR and the structurally similarvasopressin 1a receptor (AVPR1A). We have developed a pharmacologically-informed competitive binding autoradiography protocol that selectively reveals OXTR andAVPR1A binding sites in primate brain sections. Using this protocol, we describe the neuroanatomical distribution of OXTR in the macaque. Finally, we use in situ hybridization to localize OXTR mRNA. Our results demonstrate that OXTR expressionin the macaque brain is much more restricted than AVPR1A. OXTR is largely limitedto the nucleus basalis of Meynert, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, thesuperficial gray layer of the superior colliculus, the trapezoid body, and theventromedial hypothalamus. These regions are involved in a variety of functionsrelevant to social cognition, including modulating visual attention, processingauditory and multimodal sensory stimuli, and controlling orienting responses tovisual stimuli. These results provide insights into the neural mechanisms bywhich oxytocin modulates social cognition and behavior in this species, which,like humans, uses vision and audition as the primary modalities for socialcommunication.
 Chronic social/emotional deficits are common in moderate to severe traumaticbrain injury (TBI), leading to significant functional difficulties. Objective,quantitative tools for assessing social/emotional competence are an importantadjunct to cognitive assessments. We review existing social/emotional measures,conclude that theory of mind tests are not adequate for clinical assessments ofsocial competence, and explain the development and piloting of novel measures in a small group of moderate to severe TBI patients (N = 16) and non-brain-damagedcontrols (N = 16). The novel measures are the Global Interpersonal Skills Test(GIST), a questionnaire measuring informant-rated social skills; the Assessmentof Social Context (ASC), a video-based task examining understanding of others'emotions, attitudes, and intentions; the Social Interpretations Test, a socialframing task based on Heider and Simmel ( 1944 ); and Awareness of Interoception,a heartbeat-detection paradigm related to physiological self-awareness. In aMANOVA, other-rated social skills (GIST), ASC, and Awareness of Interoceptionscores were significantly lower for TBI patients than controls. ASC, r(31) =.655, and Social Interpretations, r(31) = .460, scores were significantlycorrelated with informant-rated social skills (GIST). We encourage clinicians to add social/emotional measures to assessments of TBI patients.
 Many of the behavioral capacities that distinguish humans from other primatesrely on fronto-parietal circuits. The superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) isthe primary white matter tract connecting lateral frontal with lateral parietalregions; it is distinct from the arcuate fasciculus, which interconnects thefrontal and temporal lobes. Here we report a direct, quantitative comparison ofSLF connectivity using virtual in vivo dissection of the SLF in chimpanzees andhumans. SLF I, the superior-most branch of the SLF, showed similar patterns ofconnectivity between humans and chimpanzees, and was proportionallyvolumetrically larger in chimpanzees. SLF II, the middle branch, and SLF III, theinferior-most branch, showed species differences in frontal connectivity. Inhumans, SLF II showed greater connectivity with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,whereas in chimps SLF II showed greater connectivity with the inferior frontalgyrus. SLF III was right-lateralized and proportionally volumetrically larger in humans, and human SLF III showed relatively reduced connectivity with dorsalpremotor cortex and greater extension into the anterior inferior frontal gyrus,especially in the right hemisphere. These results have implications for theevolution of fronto-parietal functions including spatial attention to observedactions, social learning, and tool use, and are in line with previous researchsuggesting a unique role for the right anterior inferior frontal gyrus in theevolution of human fronto-parietal network architecture.
 Scientists have increasingly turned to the brain and to neuroscience moregenerally to further an understanding of social and emotional judgments andbehavior. Yet, many neuroscientists (certainly not all) do not consider the role of relational context. Moreover, most have not examined the impact of relational context in a manner that takes advantage of conceptual and empirical advances in relationship science. Here we emphasize that: (1) all social behavior takesplace, by definition, within the context of a relationship (even if thatrelationship is a new one with a stranger), and (2) relational context shapes notonly social thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, but also some seemingly non-socialthoughts, feelings, and behaviors in profound ways. We define relational context and suggest that accounting for it in the design and interpretation ofneuroscience research is essential to the development of a coherent,generalizable neuroscience of social behavior. We make our case in two ways: (a) we describe some existing neuroscience research in three substantive areas(perceiving and reacting to others' emotions, providing help, and receiving help)that already has documented the powerful impact of relational context. (b) Wedescribe some other neuroscience research from these same areas that has nottaken relational context into account. Then, using findings from social andpersonality psychology, we make a case that different results almost certainlywould have been found had the research been conducted in a different relationalcontext. We neither attempt to review all evidence that relational context shapesneuroscience findings nor to put forward a theoretical analysis of all the waysrelational context ought to shape neuroscience findings. Our goal is simply tourge greater and more systematic consideration of relational context inneuroscientific research.
 Valence and arousal are primary dimensions of affective stimuli. An interactionof these two factors on affective processing is largely unknown. In this study,the processing of affective pictures was investigated in an orthogonal valence(positive vs. negative) by arousal (high vs. low) task design. Participants were instructed to passively view each presented picture and did not need to make any responses. The valence by arousal interaction was observed on three event-relatedpotential (ERP) components, including the P2 (160-190 ms), N2 (220-320 ms) andlate positive potential (LPP) (400-700 ms). This interaction revealed thatnegative pictures evoked larger neural responses compared with positive pictures (i.e., negative bias) at the high-arousal level, whereas negative pictures evokedsmaller neural responses than positive pictures (i.e., positive offset) at thelow-arousal level. The current results suggest that the effect of emotionalvalence on affective picture perception is modulated by levels of arousal at bothearly and late stages of processing. Finally, the main effect of valence wasevident in the P1 component (90-110 ms) and arousal effect in the N1 component(120-150 ms).
 Philosophy is rife with intractable moral dilemmas. We propose that these debatesoften exist because competing psychological systems yield different answers tothe same problem. Consequently, philosophical debate points to the natural fault lines between dissociable psychological mechanisms, and as such provides a usefulguide for cognitive neuroscience. We present two case studies from recentresearch into moral judgment: dilemmas concerning whether to harm a person inorder to save several others, and whether to punish individuals for harms caused accidentally. Finally, we analyze two features of mental conflict that apparentlycontribute to philosophical discord: the insistence that one answer to a problem must be correct ("non-negotiability") and the absence of an independent means of determining the correct answer ("non-adjudicability"). Fiery Cushman thanks theMind/Brain/Behavior Initiative for its generous support during the preparation ofthis work.
 Less than three decades ago, the fields of cognitive psychology and neuroscience joined forces to form cognitive neuroscience. More recently, neuroscience hascombined with social psychology and with economics to produce social neuroscienceand neuroeconomics. Each of these amalgamations has been revolutionary in its ownway.

 Looming stimuli are processed as threatening and activate basic neural defensesystems. However, it is unclear how animacy information modulates this response. Participants (N = 25) viewed threatening or neutral images that were eitheranimate (animals) or inanimate (objects) and which either approached (loomed) or receded from the participant. The amygdala was responsive to emotional, animacy, and looming information (particularly to looming threats and looming animatestimuli). Periaqueductal gray was also sensitive to emotional information andparticularly responsive to looming threats. The data are interpreted withincategory-specific models of the amygdala and temporal cortex.
 Recent neuroimaging findings suggest a role of the extrastriate body area (EBA)in self/other distinction and in the perception of pain and emotions in others.The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigated whether EBA is modulated by the perception of pain in others. Participants were scannedduring 2 consecutive sessions: 1) a localizer task precisely identifying EBA ineach individual and 2) event-related trials in which participants watchedpictures of pain (needle injections into human hands) inflicted in others orcontrol stimuli showing hands in no pain. The perception of pain recruited large parts of the so-called pain matrix, documenting shared neural representationsbetween the perception of pain in self and other. Both the needle injections and the control stimuli consistently activated bilateral EBA, replicating involvementof this area in the perception of body parts. However, activation during theperception of painful stimuli was not different from signal changes duringperception of the control stimuli. This suggests that EBA is not specificallyinvolved in empathy for pain.
 Understanding the properties of a social environment is important forunderstanding the dynamics of social relationships. Understanding such dynamicsis relevant for multiple fields, ranging from animal behaviour to social andcognitive neuroscience. To quantify social environment properties, recent studieshave incorporated social network analysis. Social network analysis quantifiesboth the global and local properties of a social environment, such as socialnetwork efficiency and the roles played by specific individuals, respectively.Despite the plethora of studies incorporating social network analysis, methods todetermine the amount of data necessary to derive reliable social networks arestill being developed. Determining the amount of data necessary for a reliablenetwork is critical for measuring changes in the social environment, for example following an experimental manipulation, and therefore may be critical for usingsocial network analysis to statistically assess social behaviour. In this paper, we extend methods for measuring error in acquired data and for determining theamount of data necessary to generate reliable social networks. We derived social networks from a group of 10 male rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, for threebehaviours: spatial proximity, grooming and mounting. Behaviours were coded usinga video observation technique, where video cameras recorded the compound wherethe 10 macaques resided. We collected, coded and used 10 h of video data toconstruct these networks. Using the methods described here, we found in our data that 1 h of spatial proximity observations produced reliable social networks.However, this may not be true for other studies due to differences in dataacquisition. Our results have broad implications for measuring and predicting theamount of error in any social network, regardless of species.
 Despite their genetic similarity to humans, our understanding of the role ofgenes on cognitive traits in chimpanzees remains virtually unexplored. Here, weexamined the relationship between genetic variation in the arginine vasopressinV1a receptor gene (AVPR1A) and social cognition in chimpanzees. Studies haveshown that chimpanzees are polymorphic for a deletion in a sequence in the 5'flanking region of the AVPR1A, DupB, which contains the variable RS3 repetitiveelement, which has been associated with variation in social behavior in humans.Results revealed that performance on the social cognition task was significantly heritable. Furthermore, males with one DupB(+) allele performed significantlybetter and were more responsive to socio-communicative cues than males homozygousfor the DupB- deletion. Performance on a non-social cognition task was notassociated with the AVPR1A genotype. The collective findings show that AVPR1Apolymorphisms are associated with individual differences in performance on areceptive joint attention task in chimpanzees.
 What makes possible the co-creation of meaningful action? In this paper, we go insearch of an answer to this question by combining insights from interactionalsociology and enaction. Both research schools investigate social interactions as such, and conceptualize their organization in terms of autonomy. We ask what itcould mean for an interaction to be autonomous, and discuss the structures andprocesses that contribute to and are maintained in the so-called interactionorder. We also discuss the role played by individual vulnerability as well as thevulnerability of social interaction processes in the co-creation of meaningfulaction. Finally, we outline some implications of this interdisciplinaryfraternization for the empirical study of social understanding, in particular in social neuroscience and psychology, pointing out the need for studies based ondynamic systems approaches on origins and references of coordination, andexperimental designs to help understand human co-presence.
 OBJECTIVE: Two hypotheses, gaze aversion and gaze indifference, are commonlycited to explain a diagnostic hallmark of autism: reduced attention to others'eyes. The two posit different areas of atypical brain function, differentpathogenic models of disability, and different possible treatments. Evidence for and against each hypothesis is mixed but has thus far focused on older childrenand adults. The authors evaluated both mechanistic hypotheses in two sets ofexperiments at the time of initial diagnosis. METHOD: Eye-tracking data werecollected in 86 2-year-olds: 26 with autism, tested at initial diagnosis; 38matched typically developing children; and 22 matched developmentally delayedchildren. In two experiments, the authors measured response to direct andimplicit cueing to look at the eyes. RESULTS: When directly cued to look at theeyes, 2-year-olds with autism did not look away faster than did typicallydeveloping children; their latency varied neither categorically nor dimensionallyby degree of eye cueing. Moreover, direct cueing had a stronger sustained effect on their amount of eye-looking than on that of typically developing children.When presented with implicit social cues for eye-looking, 2-year-olds with autismneither shifted their gaze away nor more subtly averted their gaze to peripheral locations. CONCLUSIONS: The results falsify the gaze aversion hypothesis;instead, at the time of initial diagnosis, diminished eye-looking in autism isconsistent with passive insensitivity to the social signals in others' eyes.
 Despite the fact that physical health and cognitive abilities decline with aging,the ability to regulate emotion remains stable and in some aspects improvesacross the adult life span. Older adults also show a positivity effect in theirattention and memory, with diminished processing of negative stimuli relative to positive stimuli compared with younger adults. The current paper reviewsfunctional magnetic resonance imaging studies investigating age-relateddifferences in emotional processing and discusses how this evidence relates totwo opposing theoretical accounts of older adults' positivity effect. Theaging-brain model [Cacioppo et al. in: Social Neuroscience: Toward Understanding the Underpinnings of the Social Mind. New York, Oxford University Press, 2011]proposes that older adults' positivity effect is a consequence of age-relateddecline in the amygdala, whereas the cognitive control hypothesis[Kryla-Lighthall and Mather in: Handbook of Theories of Aging, ed 2. New York,Springer, 2009; Mather and Carstensen: Trends Cogn Sci 2005;9:496-502; Mather andKnight: Psychol Aging 2005;20:554-570] argues that the positivity effect is aresult of older adults' greater focus on regulating emotion. Based on evidencefor structural and functional preservation of the amygdala in older adults andfindings that older adults show greater prefrontal cortex activity than youngeradults while engaging in emotion-processing tasks, we argue that the cognitivecontrol hypothesis is a more likely explanation for older adults' positivityeffect than the aging-brain model.
 Numerous studies have shown that familiarity strongly influences how well humans recognize faces. This is particularly true when faces are encountered across achange in viewpoint. In this situation, recognition may be accomplished bymatching partial or incomplete information about a face to a storedrepresentation of the known individual, whereas such representations are notavailable for unknown faces. Chimpanzees, our closest living relatives, sharemany of the same behavioral specializations for face processing as humans, butthe influence of familiarity and viewpoint have never been compared in the samestudy. Here, we examined the ability of chimpanzees to match the faces offamiliar and unfamiliar conspecifics in their frontal and 3/4 views using acomputerized task. Results showed that, while chimpanzees were able to accuratelymatch both familiar and unfamiliar faces in their frontal orientations,performance was significantly impaired only when unfamiliar faces were presented across a change in viewpoint. Therefore, like in humans, face processing inchimpanzees appears to be sensitive to individual familiarity. We propose thatfamiliarization is a robust mechanism for strengthening the representation offaces and has been conserved in primates to achieve efficient individualrecognition over a range of natural viewing conditions.
 Counterfactual reasoning is a hallmark of human thought, enabling the capacity toshift from perceiving the immediate environment to an alternative, imaginedperspective. Mental representations of counterfactual possibilities (e.g.,imagined past events or future outcomes not yet at hand) provide the basis forlearning from past experience, enable planning and prediction, support creativityand insight, and give rise to emotions and social attributions (e.g., regret and blame). Yet remarkably little is known about the psychological and neuralfoundations of counterfactual reasoning. In this review, we survey recentfindings from psychology and neuroscience indicating that counterfactual thought depends on an integrative network of systems for affective processing, mentalsimulation, and cognitive control. We review evidence to elucidate how thesemechanisms are systematically altered through psychiatric illness andneurological disease. We propose that counterfactual thinking depends on thecoordination of multiple information processing systems that together enableadaptive behavior and goal-directed decision making and make recommendations for the study of counterfactual inference in health, aging, and disease.
 The lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) plays a critical role in inhibitingself-perspective information, which is necessary for theory of mind (ToM)processing. Additionally, previous research has indicated that negative emotions interfere with lPFC activation during executive tasks. In this study, wehypothesized that negative emotions would inhibit lPFC activation during a ToMtask. While female participants performed the director task following theobservation of emotionally laden movies (neutral/negative/positive), theirprefrontal hemodynamic activity was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy.After viewing the neutral movie, bilateral lPFC activity was significantlyenhanced during ToM process compared to the control condition. In contrast, afterviewing the negative movie, left lPFC activity during ToM process wassignificantly impaired. These results were interpreted to support the idea thatnegative emotions interfere with inhibition of self-perspective informationthrough inactivation of the lPFC.
 Several lines of functional neuroimaging studies have attributed a role for theinsula, a critical component of the brain's emotional circuitry, in riskydecision-making. However, very little evidence yet exists as to whether theinsula is necessary for advantageous decision-making under risk, specificallydecisions involving uncertain gains and losses. The present study uses a riskydecision-making task with lesion patients and healthy controls to investigate theeffects of focal insula damage on risk-taking to achieve gains and to avoidlosses. Compared to healthy controls, insula lesion patients showed an altereddecision-making pattern in domains involving both risky gains and risky losses.Specifically, insula damage was associated with insensitivity to differences inexpected value between choice options. Additionally, patients made significantly fewer risky choices than healthy adults in the gain domain. In conjunction withearlier findings, these results suggest that risky decision-making is dependenton the integrity of a neural circuitry that includes several brain regions known to be critical for the experience and expression of emotions, namely the insula, amygdala, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. However, each neural region seemsto provide a distinct contribution to the overall process of decision-making.
 Predictive theories of action observation propose that we use our own motorsystem as a guide for anticipating and understanding other people's actionsthrough the generation of context-based expectations. According to this view,people should be better in predicting and interpreting those actions that arepresent in their own motor repertoire compared to those that are not. We recordedhigh-density event-related potentials (ERPs: P300, N400 and Slow Wave, SW) andsource estimation in 80 subjects separated by their level of expertise (experts, beginners and naives) as they observed realistic videos of Tango steps withdifferent degrees of execution correctness. We also performed path analysis toinfer causal relationships between ongoing anticipatory brain activity, evokedsemantic responses, expertise measures and behavioral performance. We found that anticipatory activity, with sources in a fronto-parieto-occipital network, early discriminated between groups according to their level of expertise. Furthermore, this early activity significantly predicted subsequent semantic integrationindexed by semantic responses (N400 and SW, sourced in temporal and motorregions) which also predicted motor expertise. In addition, motor expertise was agood predictor of behavioral performance. Our results show that neural andtemporal dynamics underlying contextual action anticipation and comprehension canbe interpreted in terms of successive levels of contextual prediction that aresignificantly modulated by subject's prior experience.
 The fields of psychoanalysis and neuroscience use different methods ofdescription, analysis and comprehension of reality, and because each is based on a different methodology, each approach constructs a different representation ofreality. Thus, psychoanalysis could contribute to a general psychology involving neuroscience to the extent that a "psychoanalytical psychology" (the theory ofmental functioning that is extrapolated from psychoanalytical practice) definesnatural objects of study (mind functions) for a multidisciplinary approach.However, the so called "naturalisation" of psychoanalytical concepts(metapsychology) does not imply the reduction of these concepts to biology;rather, it suggests a search for compatibility between psychoanalytical concepts and neuroscientific description. Such compatibility would mean the search forcommon objects that could be described from either a psychoanalytic or aneuroscientific point of view. We suggest that inter-subjectivity, empathy or"co-thinking" processes, from early development to the psychoanalyticrelationship or the interaction between the patient and the analyst, could besuch a common object for cognitive social neuroscience and psychoanalysis.Together, neuroscience and psychoanalysis could then contribute to amultidisciplinary approach of psychic inter- or co-activity.
 Social species, by definition, create emergent organizations beyond theindividual that range in humans from dyads, families, and groups to cities,civilizations, and cultures. These emergent structures evolved hand-in-hand with neural, hormonal, and genetic mechanisms to support them because the consequentsocial behaviors helped these organisms survive, reproduce, and care foroffspring sufficiently long that they too survived to reproduce. Socialneuroscience is concerned with investigating these emergent structures and theunderlying neural, hormonal, and genetic mechanisms that make them possible. Assuch, it represents an interdisciplinary approach devoted to understanding howbiological systems implement social processes and behavior, and to usingbiological concepts and methods to inform and refine theories of social processesand behavior.

 In drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), MRI studies have shown consistentmesiotemporal and neocortical structural alterations when comparing patients tohealthy controls. It remains, however, relatively unclear whether the side ofseizure focus differentially impacts the degree of structural damage. This workperformed a comprehensive surface-based analysis of mesiotemporal and neocorticalmorphology on preoperative 1.5 T MRI in 25/35 LTLE/RTLE patients that achievedseizure freedom after surgery (i.e., Engel-I outcome; 7 +/- 2 years follow-up),an imaging-independent confirmation of focus lateralization. Compared to 46 age- and sex-matched controls, both TLE groups displayed marked ipsilateral atrophy inmesiotemporal regions, while cortical thinning was bilateral. Direct contrastsbetween LTLE and RTLE did not reveal significant differences. Bootstrapsimulations indicated low reproducibility of observing a between-cohortdifference; power analysis revealed that more than 110 patients would benecessary to detect subtle differences. No difference between LTLE and RTLE wasconfirmed when using voxel-based morphometry, an independent proxy of gray mattervolume. Similar results were obtained analyzing a separate 3 T dataset (15/15LTLE/RTLE patients; Engel-I after 4 +/- 2 years follow-up; 42 controls). Ourresults strongly support equivalent gray matter compromise in left and right TLE.The morphological profile of seizure-free patients, presenting with ipsilateralmesiotemporal and bilateral cortical atrophy, motivates the development ofneuromarkers of outcome that consider both mesiotemporal and neocorticalstructures.

 Social support refers to interpersonal exchanges that include the combinations ofaid, affirmation and affection. Perceived social support is a kind of subjective judgment of one's availability of social support. In spite of the importance ofperceived social support to health, however, its neural substrate remainsunknown. To address this question, voxel-based morphometry was employed toinvestigate the neural bases of individual differences in responses to thePerceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) in healthy volunteers (144 men and 203women; mean age = 19.9; SD = 1.33, age range : 17-27). As a result, multipleregression analysis revealed that the PSSS scores were significantly andpositively correlated with gray matter volume in a cluster that mainly includedareas in posterior parts of posterior cingulate cortex, bilateral lingual cortex,left occipital lobe and cuneus. Highly-supported individuals had larger graymatter volume in these brain regions, implying a relatively high level of abilityto engage in self-referential processes and social cognition. Our results providea biological basis for exploring perceived social support particularly inrelationship to various health parameters and outcomes.
 Since the 1990s, several disciplines have emerged at the interface betweenneuroscience and the social and human sciences. For the most part, they aim atcapturing the commonalities that underlay the heterogeneity of human behaviorsand experiences. Neuroanthropology and cultural neuroscience, or the"neurodisciplines of culture," appear different, since their goal is tounderstand specificity rather than commonality and to address how culturaldifferences are inscribed in the brain. After offering an overview of thesedisciplines, and of their relation to endeavors such as cultural psychology andsocial neuroscience, this article discusses some of the most representativestudies in the area in order to explore in which ways they are relevant for anunderstanding of culture.
 Violent offenders with schizophrenia have a particularly poor performance levelin facial affect recognition. Nineteen male schizophrenia patients, who had been committed to psychiatric hospital detention because of violent offences and lack of criminal responsibility, were recruited to receive the Training of AffectRecognition (TAR). Performance in the Pictures of Facial Affect (PFA)-test andevent-related potentials (ERPs) were registered in a pre-post-treatment design.TAR was feasible with a very high treatment effect (Cohen's d = 1.88), whichpersisted for 2 months post-treatment. ERPs remained unchanged post- vs.pre-treatment, while low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA)revealed activation decreases in left-hemispheric parietal-temporal-occipitalregions at 172 msec and activation increases in right dorsolateral prefrontalcortex and anterior cingulate at 250 msec. Possibly, violent offenders withschizophrenia are particularly amenable to TAR because of a high level ofdysfunction at baseline. Post- vs. pre-treatment changes of neural activity(LORETA) may mirror a gain of efficiency in structural face decoding and a shift towards a more reflective mode of emotional face decoding, relying on increasedfrontal brain activity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) -datafrom another study further supports this notion. TAR treatment might enablesubjects with schizophrenia and a disposition to violence to reach a higherdegree of deliberation of their reactive behavior to facial affect stimuli.
 Human society is strongly rooted in people's experiences of agency; that is, the pervasive feeling that one engages in voluntary behavior and causes one's ownactions and resulting outcomes. Rewards and positive affect play an importantrole in the control of voluntary action. However, the role of positive rewardsignals in the sense of agency is poorly understood. This study examined effects of reward-related information on the sense of agency by employing the intentionalbinding paradigm. This paradigm measures the extent to which actions and theireffects subjectively shift together across time, reflecting a crucial componentof people's sense of agency. Results showed that intentional binding is stronger when participants are primed with reward-related information via brief exposureto positive pictures. Interestingly, this positive priming effect was moderatedby baseline eye-blink rates (an indirect marker of striatal dopaminergicfunctioning); reward-related information increased intentional binding mainly forparticipants displaying higher baseline eye-blink rates. These findings suggest apossible role for striatal dopamine activity in the process by whichreward-related information shapes the way people see themselves as agents.
 This fMRI study aimed at investigating how differences in personality traitsaffect the processing of dynamic and natural gestures containing social versusnonsocial intent. We predicted that while processing gestures with social intent extraversion would be associated with increased activity within thereticulothalamic-cortical arousal system (RTCS), while neuroticism would beassociated with increased activity in emotion processing circuits. The obtainedfindings partly support our hypotheses. We found a positive correlation betweenbilateral thalamic activity and extraversion scores while participants viewedsocial (versus nonsocial) gestures. For neuroticism, the data revealed a morecomplex activation pattern. Activity in the bilateral frontal operculum andanterior insula, extending into bilateral putamen and right amygdala, wasmoderated as a function of actor-orientation (i.e., first versus third-personengagement) and face-visibility (actor faces visible versus blurred). Ourfindings point to the existence of factors other than emotional valence that can influence social gesture processing in particular, and social cognitive affectiveprocessing in general, as a function of personality.
 The present study aimed at identifying dysfunctions in brain networks that mayunderlie disturbed empathic behavior in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Duringfunctional magnetic resonance imaging, subjects were asked to identify theemotional state observed in a facial stimulus (other-task) or to evaluate theirown emotional response (self-task). Behaviorally, ASD subjects performed equally to the control group during the other-task, but showed less emotionally congruentresponses in the self-task. Activations in brain regions related to theory ofmind were observed in both groups. Activations of the medial prefrontal cortex(MPFC) were located in dorsal subregions in ASD subjects and in ventral areas in control subjects. During the self-task, ASD subjects activated an additionalnetwork of frontal and inferior temporal areas. Frontal areas previouslyassociated with the human mirror system were activated in both tasks in controlsubjects, while ASD subjects recruited these areas during the self-task only.Activations in the ventral MPFC may provide the basis for one's "emotional bond" with other persons' emotions. Such atypical patterns of activation may underliedisturbed empathy in individuals with ASD. Subjects with ASD may use an atypical cognitive strategy to gain access to their own emotional state in response toother people's emotions.
 Loss or reduction of awareness is common in neuropsychiatric disorders andculturally influenced dissociative phenomena but the underlying brain mechanisms are poorly understood. fMRI was combined with suggestions for automatic writingin 18 healthy highly hypnotically suggestible individuals in a within-subjectsdesign to determine whether clinical alterations in awareness of thought andmovement can be experimentally modelled and studied independently of illness.Subjective ratings of control, ownership, and awareness of thought and movement, and fMRI data were collected following suggestions for thought insertion andalien control of writing movement, with and without loss of awareness. Subjectiveratings confirmed that suggestions were effective. At the neural level, our main findings indicated that loss of awareness for both thought and movement duringautomatic writing was associated with reduced activation in a predominantlyleft-sided posterior cortical network including BA 7 (superior parietal lobuleand precuneus), and posterior cingulate cortex, involved in self-relatedprocessing and awareness of the body in space. Reduced activity in posteriorparietal cortices may underlie specific clinical and cultural alterations inawareness of thought and movement. Clinically, these findings may assistdevelopment of imaging assessments for loss of awareness of psychological origin,and interventions such as neurofeedback.
 Recently, several event-related potential (ERP) studies investigated the impactof sender attributions on language-based social feedback processing. Resultsshowed very early responses to the social context, while interactions or effects of emotional content started later. However, in these studies, sender attributionwas varied across blocks, possibly inducing unspecific, anticipatory effects.Here, who was giving feedback was disclosed simultaneously with the decisionitself. Participants' ERPs differentiated between attributed senders startingwith the early posterior negativity. P3 and late positive potential (LPP)amplitudes were also enlarged for the "human sender". Emotion effects occurred inthe P3 and LPP time windows. Further, we found an interaction on the P3: "Human" emotional feedback was selectively amplified. Source analysis localized enhanced processing of "human"-generated feedback in visual areas from around 300 ms afterfeedback onset and from 400 ms also in temporal regions. Enhancement of "human"emotional feedback resulted from increased activations in the left visual wordform area. These findings highlight that decoding who is giving feedback precedescontent processing, both in blocked and in randomly alternating situations.Further, in quasi-realistic social contexts, processing of emotional content isselectively amplified. Finally, involvement of semantic language processingstructures indicates reintegration of words in a salient context.
 It has been suggested that differential use of configural processing strategiesmay underlie racially based recognition deficits (known as the "other-raceeffect"). By employing a well-known configural manipulation (Thatcherization,i.e., rotating the eyes and mouth by 180 degrees ), we aimed to demonstrate,electrophysiologically, that configural processing is used to a greater extentwhen viewing same-race faces than when viewing other-race faces. Face-relatedevent-related potential (ERP) responses were measured for participants viewingnormal and Thatcherized faces of their own race (Caucasian) and of another race(African-American). The P1 and N170 components were modulated to a greater extentby Thatcherization for same-race faces, suggesting that the processing of thesefaces is, in fact, more reliant on configural information than other-race faces. Thatcherization also affected the P250 component more so for same-race facesindependently of orientation. The race-dependent effects of Thatcherization asearly as P1 suggest that configural encoding may be occurring much earlier thanthe well-cited N170.
 Recent research suggests that prosocial outcomes in sharing games arise fromprefrontal control of self-maximizing impulses. We used continuous theta burststimulation (cTBS) to disrupt the functioning of two prefrontal areas, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex(DMPFC). We used cTBS in the right MT/V5, as a control area. We then testedsubjects' prosocial inclinations with an unsupervised Dictator Game in which theyallocated real money anonymously between themselves and low and highsocioeconomic status (SES) players. cTBS over the two prefrontal sites madesubjects more generous compared to MT/V5. More specifically, cTBS over DLPFCincreased offers to high-SES players, while cTBS over DMPFC caused increasedoffers to low-SES players. These data, the first to demonstrate an effect ofdisruptive neuromodulation on costly sharing, suggest that DLPFC and MPFC exertinhibitory control over prosocial inclinations during costly sharing, though theymay do so in different ways. DLPFC may implement contextual control, while DMPFC may implement a tonic form of control. This study demonstrates that humans'prepotent inclination is toward prosocial outcomes when cognitive control isreduced, even when prosocial decisions carry no strategic benefit and concernsfor reputation are minimized.
 Mental state decoding is the aspect of theory-of-mind (ToM) reasoning thatrequires individuals to make judgments about others' mental states based solelyon immediately available information. We investigated whether individualdifferences in resting, task-independent frontal EEG alpha asymmetries predicted performance on the "Mind in the Eyes" (MIE) task, which is an established measureof mental state decoding skills. Group analyses showed that mental state decodingskills were stronger among those with right-lateralized frontal activation.Individual differences analyses showed that the degree of relative rightmid-frontal activation predicted performance on the task. These findingsestablish a neural correlate of individual differences in one aspect of ToM, and hypotheses about the precise mechanism involved are discussed.
 It is unknown whether measures adapted from social neuroscience linked tospecific neural systems will demonstrate relationships to external variables.Four paradigms adapted from social neuroscience were administered to 173clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia to determine their relationshipsto functionally meaningful variables and to investigate their incrementalvalidity beyond standard measures of social and nonsocial cognition. The 4paradigms included 2 that assess perception of nonverbal social and action cues(basic biological motion and emotion in biological motion) and 2 that involvehigher level inferences about self and others' mental states (self-referentialmemory and empathic accuracy). Overall, social neuroscience paradigms showedsignificant relationships to functional capacity but weak relationships tocommunity functioning; the paradigms also showed weak correlations to clinicalsymptoms. Evidence for incremental validity beyond standard measures of socialand nonsocial cognition was mixed with additional predictive power shown forfunctional capacity but not community functioning. Of the newly adaptedparadigms, the empathic accuracy task had the broadest external validity. Theseresults underscore the difficulty of translating developments from neuroscienceinto clinically useful tasks with functional significance.
 Do 5-month-old infants show differences in processing objects as a function of a prior interaction with an adult? Using a live ERP paradigm we assessed thisquestion utilizing a within-subjects design. Infants saw objects during twopretest phases with an adult experimenter. We recorded event-related potentialsto the presentation of objects following the interactive pretest phases.Experimental conditions differed only in the nature of eye contact between theinfant and the experimenter during the pretests. In one condition theexperimenter engaged the infant with direct eye contact. In a second conditionthe experimenter looked only at the infant's chest. We found that the negativecomponent, related to attentional processes, showed differences betweenexperimental conditions in left fronto-central locations. These data show that5-month-old infants allocate more attention to objects that have been previously seen during direct eye-contact interaction. In addition, these results clarifythe functional nature of the negative component.
 Nowadays there is the hope that neuroscientific findings will contribute to theimprovement of building design in order to create environments which satisfyman's demands. This can be achieved through the understanding ofneurophysiological correlates of architectural perception. To this aim, theelectroencephalographic (EEG) signals of 12 healthy subjects were recorded duringthe perception of three immersive virtual reality environments (VEs). Afterwards,participants were asked to describe their experience in terms of Familiarity,Novelty, Comfort, Pleasantness, Arousal, and Presence using a rating scale from 1to 9. These perceptual dimensions are hypothesized to influence the pattern ofcerebral spectral activity, while Presence is used to assess the realism of thevirtual stimulation. Hence, the collected scores were used to analyze the PowerSpectral Density (PSD) of the EEG for each behavioral dimension in the theta,alpha and mu bands by means of time-frequency analysis and topographicstatistical maps. Analysis of Presence resulted in the activation of thefrontal-midline theta, indicating the involvement of sensorimotor integrationmechanisms when subjects expressed to feel more present in the VEs. Similarpatterns also characterized the experience of familiar and comfortable VEs. Inaddition, pleasant VEs increased the theta power across visuomotor circuits andactivated the alpha band in areas devoted to visuospatial exploration andprocessing of categorical spatial relations. Finally, the de-synchronization ofthe mu rhythm described the perception of pleasant and comfortable VEs, showingthe involvement of left motor areas and embodied mechanisms for environmentappreciation. Overall, these results show the possibility to measure EEGcorrelates of architectural perception involving the cerebral circuits ofsensorimotor integration, spatial navigation, and embodiment. These observations can help testing architectural hypotheses in order to design environmentsmatching the changing needs of humans.
 Much of everyday mental life involves information that we cannot currentlyperceive directly, from contemplating the strengths of friendships to reasoningabout the contents of other minds. Despite their primacy to everyday humanfunctioning, and in particular, to human sociality, the mechanisms that supportabstract thought are poorly understood. An explanatory framework that has gained traction recently in cognitive neuroscience is exaptation, or the re-purposing ofevolutionarily old circuitry to carry out new functions. We argue for the utilityof applying this concept to social cognition. Convergent behavioral andneuroscientific evidence suggests that humans co-opt mechanisms originallydevoted to spatial perception for more abstract domains of cognition (e.g.,temporal reasoning). Preliminary evidence suggests that some aspects of socialcognition also involve the exaptation of substrates originally evolved forprocessing physical space. We discuss the potential for future work to test more directly if cortical substrates for spatial processing were exapted for socialcognition, and in so doing, to improve our understanding of how humans evolvedmechanisms for navigating an exceptionally complex social world.
 Guilt, shame, and embarrassment are quintessential moral emotions with important regulatory functions for the individual and society. Moral emotions are, however,difficult to study with neuroimaging methods because their elicitation is moreintricate than that of basic emotions. Here, using functional MRI (fMRI), weemployed a novel social prejudice paradigm to examine specific brain regionsassociated with real-time moral emotion, focusing on guilt and relatedmoral-negative emotions. The paradigm induced intense moral-negative emotion(primarily guilt) in 22 low-prejudice individuals through preprogrammed feedback indicating implicit prejudice against Black and disabled people. fMRI dataindicated that this experience of moral-negative emotion was associated withincreased activity in anterior paralimbic structures, including the anteriorcingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula, in addition to areas associated with mentalizing, including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulatecortex, and precuneus. Of significance was prominent conflict-related activity inthe supragenual ACC, which is consistent with theories proposing an associationbetween acute guilt and behavioral inhibition. Finally, a significant negativeassociation between self-reported guilt and neural activity in the pregenual ACC suggested a role of self-regulatory processes in response to moral-negativeaffect. These findings are consistent with the multifaceted self-regulatoryfunctions of moral-negative emotions in social behavior.
 Socially correct behavior requires constant observation of the socialenvironment. Behavior that was appropriate a few seconds ago is not guaranteed tobe appropriate now. The brain keeps the eyes focused on the current social space and constantly updates its internal representation of the environment and social context. Monitoring the behavior of others is essential for this updating. Theneural systems involved in perceiving the actions of others have been exploredextensively, but the detailed, quantitative character of the system at thesingle-cell level remains poorly understood. To address this question, we usedthe new technique of multidimensional recording to record neuronal activity inmonkeys simultaneously from ventral premotor cortex (PM) and parietal cortex inthe left hemisphere while they performed a food grab task. Motion-related (MR)response was shown by 35% (52/148) of PM neurons and 54% (94/174) of parietalneurons, meaning their activity increased in response to various combinations of arm motions made by self and/or other. Both areas showed robust lateralizedpreference to Self-Right action. When it came to recognizing the actions of theother monkey, PM-MR neurons showed the same kind of right-arm preference asself-action while parietal-MR neurons, in contrast, did not show arm preference. And while both areas discriminated self-action from other, a significantly largerproportion of PM-MR neurons did so. These results suggest that PM neurons provideinformation about an action's agent and effector as primitives of actioncognition within the mirror neuron network,while parietal neurons representsocial space and participate in the recognition of another agent's actions inrelation to one's own actions within the parieto-prefrontal network.
 The use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) as a form of social interaction has become increasingly prevalent, yet few studies examine individual differencesthat may shed light on implications of CMC for adjustment. The current studyexamined neurocognitive individual differences associated with preferences to usetechnology in relation to social-emotional outcomes. In Study 1 (N = 91), aself-report measure, the Social Media Communication Questionnaire (SMCQ), wasevaluated as an assessment of preferences for communicating positive and negativeemotions on a scale ranging from purely via CMC to purely face-to-face. In Study 2, SMCQ preferences were examined in relation to event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with early emotional attention capture and reactivity (the frontal N1)and later sustained emotional processing and regulation (the late positivepotential (LPP)). Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while 22 participantspassively viewed emotional and neutral pictures and completed an emotionregulation task with instructions to increase, decrease, or maintain theiremotional responses. A greater preference for CMC was associated with reducedsize of and satisfaction with social support, greater early (N1) attentioncapture by emotional stimuli, and reduced LPP amplitudes to unpleasant stimuli inthe increase emotion regulatory task. These findings are discussed in the contextof possible emotion- and social-regulatory functions of CMC.
 Socioeconomic status (SES) has been linked to differences in the degree to which people are attuned to others. Those who are lower in SES also tend to be moreinterpersonally attuned. However, to date, this work has not been demonstratedusing neural measures. In the present electroencephalogram study, we foundevidence that lower SES was linked to stronger Mu-suppression during actionobservation. This finding adds to the growing literature on factors that affectMu-suppression and suggests that the mirror neuron system may be influenced byone's social class.
 Motor skills can be learned by practicing the whole or part of a movement. Inwhole practice (WP), a skill is acquired by practicing the movement in itsentirety, whereas in part practice (PP), a task is learned by practicing itscomponents before combining them. However, the effectiveness of WP and PP inchildren is unclear. We, therefore, examined the effects of WP and PP on thelearning of juggling among first-, third-, and fifth-graders. Children of eachgrade were pseudo-randomly assigned to the WP or PP group to learn cascadejuggling in 6 days. After baseline assessments, the WP learners practicedthree-beanbag juggling. The PP learners practiced one-beanbag juggling on thefirst 2 days, two-beanbag juggling on the following 2 days, and three-beanbagjuggling on the last 2 days. Practice consisted of 40 trials each day. Skillretention and transfer trials (juggling in the opposite direction) were measured 24h after training (number of catches). There was no significant differencebetween WP and PP in skill retention (WP: 1.28 +/- 0.73; PP: 1.42 +/- 046, p =.40) and transfer (WP: 1.31 +/- 0.78; PP: 1.37 +/- 0.55, p = .49). However, atime x grade x group interaction (p < .001) was observed in retention. Childrenof different grades received differential benefits from the WP and PP regimens.The fifth-graders learned better using WP, whereas the first- and third-gradersshowed better learning with PP. We discuss the three possible explanations forthe results (neural maturity, explicit learning, and coordination capabilities).
 Neonatal seizures pose a high risk for adverse outcome in survived infants. Whilethe prognostic value of amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) is well established in neonates with encephalopathy and asphyxia, neonatal seizurestudies focusing on the direct correlation between early aEEG measurement andsubsequent neurologic outcome are scarce. In this study, the prognostic value of aEEG features was systematically analyzed in 143 full-term neonates to identifyprognostic indicators of neurodevelopmental outcome. Neonatal aEEG features ofbackground pattern, cyclicity, and seizure activity, as well as the etiology ofneonatal seizures, were significantly associated with neurodevelopmental outcome at one year of age. aEEG background pattern was highly associated with neurologicoutcomes (chi(2) = 116.9), followed by aEEG cyclicity (chi(2) = 87.2) and seizureetiology (chi(2) = 79.3). Multiple linear regression showed that the fourpredictors explained 71.2% of the variation in neurological outcome, withstandardized beta coefficients of 0.44, 0.24, 0.22, and 0.14 for the predictorsof aEEG background pattern, cyclicity, etiology, and aEEG seizure activity,respectively. This clinically applicable scoring system based on etiology andthree aEEG indices would allow pediatricians to assess the risk forneurodevelopmental impairment and facilitate an early intervention in newbornsdeveloping seizures.
 Evolution has sculpted the incredibly complex human nervous system, among themost complex functions of which extend beyond the individual to an intricatesocial structure. Although these functions are deterministic, those determinants are legion, heavily interacting and dependent on a specific evolutionarytrajectory. That trajectory was directed by the adaptive significance ofquasi-random genetic variations, but was also influenced by chance and caprice.With a different evolutionary pathway, the same neural elements could subservefunctions distinctly different from what they do in extant human brains.Consequently, the properties of higher level neural networks cannot be derivedreadily from the properties of the lower level constituent elements, withoutstudying these elements in the aggregate. Thus, a multi-level approach tointegrative neuroscience may offer an optimal strategy. Moreover, the process of calibrative reductionism, by which concepts and understandings from one level of organization or analysis can mutually inform and 'calibrate' those from otherlevels (both higher and lower), may represent a viable approach to theapplication of reductionism in science. This is especially relevant in socialneuroscience, where the basic subject matter of interest is defined byinteracting organisms across diverse environments.
 To define the cellular mechanisms of up-regulated inflammatory gene expressionand down-regulated antiviral response in people experiencing perceived socialisolation (loneliness), we conducted integrative analyses of leukocyte generegulation in humans and rhesus macaques. Five longitudinal leukocytetranscriptome surveys in 141 older adults showed up-regulation of the sympatheticnervous system (SNS), monocyte population expansion, and up-regulation of theleukocyte conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA). Mechanisticanalyses in a macaque model of perceived social isolation confirmed CTRAactivation and identified selective up-regulation of the CD14(++)/CD16(-)classical monocyte transcriptome, functional glucocorticoid desensitization,down-regulation of Type I and II interferons, and impaired response to infection by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). These analyses identifyneuroendocrine-related alterations in myeloid cell population dynamics as a keymediator of CTRA transcriptome skewing, which may both propagate perceived socialisolation and contribute to its associated health risks.
 Neuroscience has made remarkable progress in understanding the architecture ofhuman intelligence, identifying a distributed network of brain structures thatsupport goal-directed, intelligent behavior. However, the neural foundations ofcognitive flexibility and adaptive aspects of intellectual function remain to be well characterized. Here, we report a human lesion study (n=149) thatinvestigates the neural bases of key competencies of cognitive flexibility (i.e.,mental flexibility and the fluent generation of new ideas) and systematicallyexamine their contributions to a broad spectrum of cognitive and socialprocesses, including psychometric intelligence (Wechsler Adult IntelligenceScale), emotional intelligence (Mayer, Salovey, Caruso Emotional IntelligenceTest), and personality (Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness Personality Inventory).Latent variable modeling was applied to obtain error-free indices of each factor,followed by voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping to elucidate their neuralsubstrates. Regression analyses revealed that latent scores for psychometricintelligence reliably predict latent scores for cognitive flexibility (adjustedR(2)=0.94). Lesion mapping results further indicated that these convergentprocesses depend on a shared network of frontal, temporal, and parietal regions, including white matter association tracts, which bind these areas into anintegrated system. A targeted analysis of the unique variance explained bycognitive flexibility further revealed selective damage within the right superiortemporal gyrus, a region known to support insight and the recognition of novelsemantic relations. The observed findings motivate an integrative framework forunderstanding the neural foundations of adaptive behavior, suggesting that coreelements of cognitive flexibility emerge from a distributed network of brainregions that support specific competencies for human intelligence.
 Psychiatric education is confronted with three barriers to managing stigmaassociated with mental health treatment. First, there are limited evidence-based practices for stigma reduction, and interventions to deal with stigma againstmental health care providers are especially lacking. Second, there is a scarcity of training models for mental health professionals on how to reduce stigma inclinical services. Third, there is a lack of conceptual models for neuroscienceapproaches to stigma reduction, which are a requirement for high-tier competency in the ACGME Milestones for Psychiatry. The George Washington University (GWU)psychiatry residency program has developed an eight-week course on managingstigma that is based on social psychology and social neuroscience research. Thecourse draws upon social neuroscience research demonstrating that stigma is anormal function of normal brains resulting from evolutionary processes in humangroup behavior. Based on these processes, stigma can be categorized according to different threats that include peril stigma, disruption stigma, empathy fatigue, moral stigma, and courtesy stigma. Grounded in social neuroscience mechanisms,residents are taught to develop interventions to manage stigma. Case examplesillustrate application to common clinical challenges: (1) helping patientsanticipate and manage stigma encountered in the family, community, or workplace; (2) ameliorating internalized stigma among patients; (3) conducting effectivetreatment from a stigmatized position due to prejudice from medical colleagues orpatients' family members; and (4) facilitating patient treatment plans whenstigma precludes engagement with mental health professionals. This curriculumaddresses the need for educating trainees to manage stigma in clinical settings. Future studies are needed to evaluate changes in clinical practices and patientoutcomes as a result of social neuroscience-based training on managing stigma.
 Impairments in the mirror neuron system (MNS) have been implicated as a possible underlying neurological basis for deficits in higher-level social cognition inschizophrenia. Previous work testing this hypothesis has used theelectroencephalographic mu rhythm as an index of MNS activity, with studiesshowing mixed results. Here we investigated the role that reward plays inmodulating the mu rhythm, and its association with empathy and emotional mentalstate reasoning. A group of schizophrenia patients and a healthy control groupcompleted an action observation paradigm in which they watched actions that were financially rewarding, punishing, or neutral. Patients showed intactreward-related modulation of the mu rhythm, and greater mu suppression wasassociated with greater negative symptoms. There was also a trend for reduced mu suppression in patients. Furthermore, both empathy and emotional mental statereasoning were associated with the degree of mu suppression, but only in healthy controls. These findings confirm the association between the mu suppression andhigh-level social cognition. It is possible that schizophrenia patients utilizedifferent cognitive routes to infer mental states. The demonstration that reward influences the degree of mu suppression in schizophrenia patients may help toaccount for previous conflicting findings in the literature.
 Sound categorization is essential for auditory behaviors like acousticcommunication, but its genesis within the auditory pathway is not wellunderstood-especially for learned natural categories like vocalizations, whichoften share overlapping acoustic features that must be distinguished (e.g.,speech). We use electrophysiological mapping and single-unit recordings in miceto investigate how representations of natural vocal categories within coreauditory cortex are modulated when one category acquires enhanced behavioralrelevance. Taking advantage of a maternal mouse model of acoustic communication, we found no long-term auditory cortical map expansion to represent a behaviorallyrelevant pup vocalization category-contrary to expectations from the corticalplasticity literature on conditioning with pure tones. Instead, we observedplasticity that improved the separation between acoustically similar pup andadult vocalization categories among a physiologically defined subset oflate-onset, putative pyramidal neurons, but not among putative interneurons.Additionally, a larger proportion of these putative pyramidal neurons in maternalanimals compared with nonmaternal animals responded to the individual pup callexemplars having combinations of acoustic features most typical of that category.Together, these data suggest that higher-order representations of acousticcategories arise from a subset of core auditory cortical pyramidal neurons thatbecome biased toward the combination of acoustic features statisticallypredictive of membership to a behaviorally relevant sound category.
 Many decisions people make can be described as decisions under risk.Understanding the mechanisms that drive these decisions is an important goal indecision neuroscience. Two competing classes of risky decision making models havebeen proposed to describe human behavior, namely utility-based models andrisk-return models. Here we used a novel investment decision task that usesstreams of (past) returns as stimuli to investigate how consistent the twoclasses of models are with the neurobiological processes underlying investmentdecisions (where outcomes usually follow continuous distributions). By showing(a) that risk-return models can explain choices behaviorally and (b) that thecomponents of risk-return models (value, risk, and risk attitude) are representedin the brain during choices, we provide evidence that risk-return models describethe neural processes underlying investment decisions well. Most importantly, the observed correlation between risk and brain activity in the anterior insuladuring choices supports risk-return models more than utility-based models becauserisk is an explicit component of risk-return models but not of the utility-based models.
 The present study explored cortical correlates of gesture execution andobservation in peripersonal space, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy(fNIRS). Moreover, a direct comparison was realized between resting statecondition and execution/observation. Meaningful gestures produced in the presence(transitive action) or in the absence (intransitive action) of the object wereconsidered in a real context (situated representation of gestures). Subjects wererequired to execute or observe transitive versus intransitive gestures duringfNIRS registration. Gesture execution was related to higher brain activity(increased oxygenated hemoglobin levels) with respect to observation in motorareas (premotor cortex, PMC; supplementary motor cortex, SM1). In contrast, theposterior parietal cortex was similarly activated in case of both execution andobservation task. Moreover, both tasks showed increased brain activity withinthese areas compared to resting state. Finally, it was shown that actionexecution and observation of transitive gestures was supported by similarparietal posterior areas. These findings support the hypothesis of a partialcommon network for observation and execution of gestures within peripersonalspace, mainly in transitive condition.
 When we are learning to associate novel cues with outcomes, learning is moreefficient if we take advantage of previously learned associations and therebyavoid redundant learning. The blocking effect represents this sort of efficiency mechanism and refers to the phenomenon in which a novel stimulus is blocked from learning when it is associated with a fully predicted outcome. Although there is sufficient evidence that this effect manifests itself when individuals learnabout their own rewards, it remains unclear whether it also does when they learn about others' rewards. We employed behavioral and neuroimaging methods to addressthis question. We demonstrate that blocking does indeed occur in the socialdomain and it does so to a similar degree as observed in the individual domain.On the neural level, activations in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) show aspecific contribution to blocking and learning-related prediction errors in thesocial domain. These findings suggest that the efficiency principle that applies to reward learning in the individual domain also applies to that in the socialdomain, with the mPFC playing a central role in implementing it.
 The coppery titi monkey (Callicebus cupreus) is a socially monogamous New Worldprimate that has been studied in the field and the laboratory to investigate the behavioral neuroendocrinology of primate pair bonding and parental care. Argininevasopressin has been shown to influence male titi monkey pair-bonding behavior,and studies are currently underway to examine the effects of oxytocin on titimonkey behavior and physiology. Here, we use receptor autoradiography to identifythe distribution of arginine vasopressin 1a receptor (AVPR1a) and oxytocinreceptors (OXTR) in hemispheres of titi monkey brain (n=5). AVPR1a are diffuseand widespread throughout the brain, but the OXTR distribution is much morelimited, with the densest binding being in the hippocampal formation (dentategyrus, CA1 field) and the presubiculum (layers I and III). Moderate OXTR binding was detected in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, pulvinar, superior colliculus,layer 4C of primary visual cortex, periaqueductal gray (PAG), pontine gray,nucleus prepositus, and spinal trigeminal nucleus. OXTR mRNA overlapped with OXTRradioligand binding, confirming that the radioligand was detecting OXTR protein. AVPR1a binding is present throughout the cortex, especially in cingulate,insular, and occipital cortices, as well as in the caudate, putamen, nucleusaccumbens, central amygdala, endopiriform nucleus, hippocampus (CA4 field),globus pallidus, lateral geniculate nucleus, infundibulum, habenula, PAG,substantia nigra, olivary nucleus, hypoglossal nucleus, and cerebellum.Furthermore, we show that, in the titi monkey brain, the OXTR antagonistALS-II-69 is highly selective for OXTR and that the AVPR1a antagonist SR49059 is highly selective for AVPR1a. Based on these results and the fact that bothALS-II-69 and SR49059 are non-peptide, small-molecule antagonists that should be capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, these two compounds emerge asexcellent candidates for the pharmacological manipulation of OXTR and AVPR1a infuture behavioral experiments in titi monkeys and other primate species.
 Love of money (LOM) is concerned with the attitude toward money, which can bemeasured by the LOM scale through affective, behavioral, and cognitivedimensions. Research has observed that monetary attitude was tightly related toreward processing and could affect economic behavior. This study examined howmonetary attitude modulated risky behavior and the underlying neural mechanismsof reward processing using event-related potential (ERP) technique. We comparedboth the risk level and brain responses of a high-level LOM (HLOM) group to alow-level LOM (LLOM) group using a simple gambling task. The behavioral resultsshowed that the HLOM group was more risky than the LLOM group, particularly afterloss. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) was measured as the difference wave(gain-related ERP was subtracted from loss-related ERP). The FRN difference wave was larger in the HLOM group than that in the LLOM group. The P3 in the HLOMgroup was more positive than that in the LLOM group. These results suggest thatmonetary attitude can modulate both the underlying neural mechanisms andbehavioral performance in a reward-related task. The HLOM participants are moresensitive to gain/loss than the LLOM participants.
 BACKGROUND: There are no drugs that specifically target the social deficits ofautism spectrum disorders (ASD). This may be due to a lack of behavioralparadigms in animal models relevant to ASD. Partner preference formation in theprairie vole represents a social cognitive process involving socially reinforced learning. D-cycloserine (DCS) is a cognitive enhancer that acts at theN-methyl-D-aspartate receptor to promote learning. If DCS enhances sociallyreinforced learning in the partner preference paradigm, it may be useful incombination with behavioral therapies for enhancing social functioning in ASD.METHODS: Female prairie and meadow voles were given DCS either peripherally ordirectly into one of three brain regions: nucleus accumbens, amygdala, or caudateputamen. Subjects were then cohabited with a male vole under conditions that donot typically yield a partner preference. The development of a preference forthat stimulus male vole over a novel male vole was assessed using a partnerpreference test. RESULTS: A low dose of DCS administered peripherally enhancedpreference formation in prairie voles but not meadow voles under conditions inwhich it would not otherwise occur. These effects were replicated in prairievoles by microinfusions of DCS into the nucleus accumbens, which is involved inreinforcement learning, and the amygdala, which is involved in social informationprocessing. CONCLUSIONS: Partner preference in the prairie vole may provide abehavioral paradigm with face, construct, and predictive validity for identifyingprosocial pharmacotherapeutics. D-cycloserine may be a viable treatment strategy for social deficits of ASD when paired with social behavioral therapy.
 The melanocortin receptor (MCR) system has been studied extensively for its role in feeding and sexual behavior, but effects on social behavior have receivedlittle attention. alpha-MSH interacts with neural systems involved in sociality, including oxytocin, dopamine, and opioid systems. Acute melanotan-II (MTII), anMC3/4R agonist, potentiates brain oxytocin (OT) release and facilitatesOT-dependent partner preference formation in socially monogamous prairie voles.Here we examined the long-term impact of early-life MCR stimulation onhypothalamic neuronal activity and social development in prairie voles. Male and female voles were given daily subcutaneous injections of 10 mg/kg MTII or saline between postnatal days (PND) 1-7. Neonatally-treated males displayed a reduction in initiated play fighting bouts as juveniles compared to control males. Neonatalexposure to MTII facilitated partner preference formation in adult females, butnot males, after a brief cohabitation with an opposite-sex partner. Acute MTIIinjection elicited a significant burst of the immediate early gene EGR-1immunoreactivity in hypothalamic OT, vasopressin, and corticotrophin releasingfactor neurons, when tested in PND 6-7 animals. Daily neonatal treatment with 1mg/kg of a more selective, brain penetrant MC4R agonist, PF44687, promoted adult partner preferences in both females and males compared with vehicle controls.Thus, developmental exposure to MCR agonists lead to a persistent change insocial behavior, suggestive of structural or functional changes in the neuralcircuits involved in the formation of social relationships.
 OBJECTIVES: The present research explored the effect of reward sensitivity biasand metacognitive deficits on substance use disorder (SUD) in the decision-makingprocess. METHODS: The behavioral activation system (BAS) was used as a predictivemarker of dysfunctional behavior during the Iowa gambling task (IGT). We alsotried to relate this motivational system bias to self-reported metacognitivemeasures (self-knowledge, strategic planning, flexibility, and efficacy) in thedecision processes. Thirty-four SUD participants (cocaine dependent) and 39participants in the control group underwent the IGT. RESULTS: The SUD group wasassociated with a poorer performance on the IGT and a dysfunctional metacognitionability (unrealistic representation). An increase in the reward sensitivity(higher BAS, BAS reward responsiveness, and BAS reward) was observed in the SUDgroup compared with the control group and explained (through a regressionanalysis) the main behavioral deficits. More generally, an increase in the BASreward responsiveness may be considered a predictive measure of risk-taking anddysfunctional behavior, not only in pathological (SUD) individuals, but also insubclinical individuals (controls). CONCLUSIONS: We discuss the likely cognitive,brain, and neurotransmitter contributions to this phenomenon.
 This paper proposes an empirical hypothesis that in some cases of socialinteraction we have an immediate perceptual access to others' minds in theperception of their embodied intentionality. Our point of departure is thephenomenological insight that there is an experiential difference in theperception of embodied intentionality and the perception of non-intentionality.The other's embodied intentionality is perceptually given in a way that isdifferent from the givenness of non-intentionality. We claim that thephenomenological difference in the perception of embodied intentionality andnon-intentionality translates into an account of how, in some cases of socialcognition, we perceive mental properties in the perception of embodiedintentionality. The hypothesis derives support from a host of recent empiricalstudies in social neuroscience which demonstrate the importance of embodiedengagements in understanding other minds. These studies reveal that embodiedintersubjective interaction often builds on our ability to understand other mindsin an immediate perceptual way not adequately investigated by theory-theory (TT) and simulation theories (ST) of mind-reading. We argue that there is a genuine,nontrivial difference in the informational content of the perception of embodied intentionality and the perception of non-intentionality which leads to a further difference in the way information is processed in the case of perception ofembodied intentionality as opposed to the perception of non-intentionality. Thefull significance of such difference is appreciated only within an account ofperception which views perception and action as tightly coupled. Thus, we proposean "action-oriented account of social perception" to develop a neurophilosophicalaccount of the perceptual knowledge of other minds.
 During the past half century of research with preclinical animal models,affective neuroscience has helped identify and illuminate the functionalneuroanatomies and neurochemistries of seven primary process, i.e., geneticallyprovided emotional systems of mammalian brains. All are subcortically localized, allowing animal models to guide the needed behavioral and neuroscientificanalyses at levels of detail that cannot be achieved through human research,including modern brain imaging. They consist of the following neuronal processes:SEEKING/Enthusiasm, RAGE/Anger, FEAR/Anxiety, sexual LUST/Passion, maternalCARE/Nurturance, separation-distress PANIC/Grief and PLAY/Social Joy. Several of these systems figure heavily in social bonding. I will focus here especially onthe genesis of depression. Its genesis is significantly influenced by (i)sustained overactivity of the separation-distress PANIC system reflecting severedsocial bonds and the excessive "psychological pain" of loneliness that can, ifsustained, lead to a downward cascade known as psychological despair, and (ii)the despair phase that follows the acute PANIC response, which is characterizedby abnormally low activity of the SEEKING, the so-called brain reward networks,leading to amotivational states that characterize depression. Depressive affectis promoted by such brain affective mechanisms of social attachments and socialloss as well as diminished arousability of the SEEKING system, leading to chronicdysphoria. To understand why depression feels so bad, we must understand theneural mechanisms that mediate such social feelings.
 Infant faces elicit early, specific activity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), akey cortical region for reward and affective processing. A test of the causalrelationship between infant facial configuration and OFC activity is provided by naturally occurring disruptions to the face structure. One such disruption iscleft lip, a small change to one facial feature, shown to disrupt parenting.Using magnetoencephalography, we investigated neural responses to infant faceswith cleft lip compared with typical infant and adult faces. We found activity inthe right OFC at 140 ms in response to typical infant faces but diminishedactivity to infant faces with cleft lip or adult faces. Activity in the rightfusiform face area was of similar magnitude for typical adult and infant facesbut was significantly lower for infant faces with cleft lip. This is the firstevidence that a minor change to the infant face can disrupt neural activitypotentially implicated in caregiving.
 Neuroscientific explanations of gambling disorder can help people make sense oftheir experiences and guide the development of psychosocial interventions.However, the societal perceptions and implications of these explanations are not always clear or helpful. Two workshops in 2013 and 2014 brought togethermultidisciplinary researchers aiming to improve the clinical and policy-relatedeffects of neuroscience research on gambling. The workshops revealed thatneuroscience can be used to improve identification of the dangers of productsused in gambling. Additionally, there was optimism associated with the diagnosticand prognostic uses of neuroscience in problem gambling and the provision ofnovel tools (eg, virtual reality) to assess the effectiveness of new policyinterventions before their implementation. Other messages from these workshopswere that neuroscientific models of decision making could provide a strongrationale for precommitment strategies and that interdisciplinary collaborations are needed to reduce the harms of gambling.
 In this paper we suggest that differing approaches to the science of socialcognition mirror the arguments between radical embodied and traditionalapproaches to cognition. We contrast the use in social cognition of theoreticalinference and mental simulation mechanisms with approaches emphasizing a directperception of others' mental states. We build from a recent integrative frameworkunifying these divergent perspectives through the use of dual-process theory and supporting social neuroscience research. Our elaboration considers twocomplementary notions of direct perception: one primarily stemming fromecological psychology and the other from enactive cognition theory. We use thisas the foundation from which to offer an account of the informational basis forsocial information and assert a set of research propositions to further thescience of social cognition. In doing so, we point out how perception of theminds of others can be supported in some cases by lawful information, supporting direct perception of social affordances and perhaps, mental states, and in other cases by cues that support indirect perceptual inference. Our goal is to extendaccounts of social cognition by integrating advances across disciplines toprovide a multi-level and multi-theoretic description that can advance this fieldand offer a means through which to reconcile radical embodied and traditionalapproaches to cognitive neuroscience.
 Recent research has examined the effects of oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP)on human social behavior and brain function. However, most participants have beenmale, while previous research in our lab demonstrated sexually differentiatedeffects of OT and AVP on the neural response to reciprocated cooperation. Here weextend our previous work by significantly increasing the number of participantsto enable the use of more stringent statistical thresholds that permit moreprecise localization of OT and AVP effects in the brain. In a double-blind,placebo-controlled study, 153 men and 151 women were randomized to receive 24 IU intranasal OT, 20 IU intranasal AVP or placebo. Afterwards, they were imaged withfMRI while playing an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game with same-sex partners.Sex differences were observed for effects of OT on the neural response toreciprocated cooperation, such that OT increased the caduate/putamen responseamong males, whereas it decreased this response among females. Thus, 24 IU OT mayincrease the reward or salience of positive social interactions among men, while decreasing their reward or salience among women. Similar sex differences werealso observed for AVP effects within bilateral insula and right supramarginalgyrus when a more liberal statistical threshold was employed. While our findings support previous suggestions that exogenous nonapeptides may be effectivetreatments for disorders such as depression and autism spectrum disorder, theycaution against uniformly extending such treatments to men and women alike.
 The two studies reported in this article are an extension of the neuroimagingstudy by Ganis et al. (2003), which provided evidence that different types oflies arise from different cognitive processes. We examined the initial responsetimes (IRTs) to questions answered both deceptively and truthfully. We consideredfour types of deceptive responses: a coherent set of rehearsed, memorized liesabout a life experience; a coherent set of lies spontaneously created about alife experience; a set of isolated lies involving self-knowledge; and a set ofisolated lies involving knowledge of another person. We assessed the differencebetween truthful and deceptive IRTs. Scores from cognitive tasks included in the MiniCog Rapid Assessment Battery (MRAB) were significant predictors of IRTdifferences. Each type of lie was predicted by a distinct set of MRAB scores.These results provide further evidence that deception is a multifaceted processand that different kinds of lies arise from the operation of different cognitive processes.
 This study tested the hypothesis that individual differences in the activity ofthe orbitofrontal cortex, a region implicated in value-based decision-making, areassociated with the preference for a person with a partner, which could lead tomate poaching. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), maleparticipants were presented with facial photographs of (a) attractive femaleswith a partner, (b) attractive females without a partner, (c) unattractivefemales with a partner, and (d) unattractive females without a partner. Theparticipants were asked to rate the degree to which they desired a romanticrelationship with each female using an 8-point scale. The participants ratedattractive females higher than unattractive females, and this effect wasassociated with ventral striatum activation. The participants also indicatedlower ratings for females with a partner than for females without a partner, and this effect was associated with parietal cortex activation. As predicted, theparticipants characterized by higher orbitofrontal activity demonstrated agreater willingness to engage in a romantic relationship with females who have a partner compared with females who do not have a partner. These results are thefirst to provide a possible neural explanation for why certain individuals arewilling to engage in mate poaching.
 Recent research indicates that the neuropeptide oxytocin and the gene for theoxytocin receptor (OXTR) have been implicated in the modulation of various socialbehaviors, including those related to empathy and sensitivity to others. In this study, we examine the hypothesis that genetic variation in OXTR is associatedwith autonomic reactions when perceiving others in distress. We also explore the possibility that individual disposition in empathic concern would differ by OXTR genotype. To address these questions, 51 male participants (18-35 years of age), genotyped for OXTR rs53576, viewed a social interaction containing high levels ofindividual distress and apparent physical pain. Electrodermal activity, a measureof sympathetic nervous system activity, was collected during the presentation of the stimuli. Participants also completed a self-report dispositional measure ofempathy prior to starting the study and provided ratings of arousal while viewingthe stimuli. OXTR variant rs53576 GG individuals showed increased levels ofsympathetic and subjective arousal in response to the stimuli compared to Aallele carriers. GG homozygotes also expressed greater levels of empathicconcern. These findings support the importance of the oxytocin receptor variationin emotional and physiological reactions to the affective experiences of otherconspecifics.
 Due to its fast temporal evolution and its representation and integration amongcomplex and widespread neural networks, the emotion perception process shouldpreferably be examined by means of multimethodological approach. Indeed theindubitable vantage of acquiring both the autonomic (arousal-related) and thecentral (cortical-related) activities stands in the possibility to betterelucidate the reciprocal interplay of the two compartments. In the present study EEG (frequency band analysis), systemic SCR and heart rate (HR) were all recordedsimultaneously with hemodynamic (NIRS, Near-Infrared Spectroscopy) measurementsas potential biological markers of emotions, related to both central andperipheral systems. These multiple measures were then related to the self-report correlates, that is the subjective appraisal in term of valence (positive vs.negative) and arousal (high vs. low) by using SAM rating. Twenty subjects weresubmitted to emotional cues processing (IAPS) when fNIRS, frequency bands (alpha,beta, delta, theta), SCR and HR were recorded. As shown by O2Hb increasing withinthe right hemisphere, the contribution of prefrontal cortex was elucidated, bypointing out a relevant lateralization effect (more right-PFC activity) inducedby the specific valence (negative) of the emotional patterns. Secondly, EEGactivity (mainly low-frequency theta and delta bands) was intrinsicallyassociated with the cortical hemodynamic responsiveness to the negative emotionalpatterns, within the right side. Finally SCR increased mainly in response tonegative patterns, and the autonomic behavior was related to explicit (SAM) andcortical (NIRS; EEG) activity. The intrinsic relationships between these threedifferent levels are discussed.
 We begin by illustrating that long before the cognitive revolution, socialpsychology focused on topics pertaining to what is now known as social cognition:people's subjective interpretations of social situations and the concepts andcognitive processes underlying these interpretations. We then examine twoquestions: whether social cognition entails characteristic concepts and cognitiveprocesses, and how social processes might themselves shape and constraincognition. We suggest that social cognition relies heavily on generic cognitionbut also on unique concepts (e.g., agent, intentionality) and unique processes(e.g., projection, imitation, joint attention). We further suggest that socialprocesses play a prominent role in the development and unfolding of severalgeneric cognitive processes, including learning, attention, and memory. Finally, we comment on the prospects of a recently developing approach to the study ofsocial cognition (social neuroscience) and two potential future directions(computational social cognition and social-cognitive robotics).
 Self-construals are different between Western and East Asian cultures in that theWestern self emphasizes self-focused attention more, whereas the East Asian self stresses the fundamental social connections between people more. To investigatewhether such cultural difference in self-related processing extends to facerecognition, we recorded event-related potentials from British and Chinesesubjects while they judged head orientations of their own face or a familiar facein visual displays. For the British, the own-face induced faster responses and a larger negative activity at 280-340 ms over the frontal-central area (N2)relative to the familiar face. In contrast, the Chinese showed weakenedself-advantage in behavioral responses and reduced anterior N2 amplitude to theown-face compared with the familiar face. Our findings suggest that enhancedsocial salience of one's own face results in different neurocognitive processesof self-recognition in Western and Chinese cultures.
 MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine or "ecstasy") is a recreationally useddrug with remarkable and characteristic prosocial effects. In spite of abundantattention in the scientific literature, the mechanism of its prosocial effectshas not been elucidated in humans. Recently, research in animals has suggestedthat the neuropeptide oxytocin may induce these effects. In a double blind,randomized, crossover, and placebo-controlled study in 15 healthy volunteers weassessed blood oxytocin and MDMA concentrations and subjective prosocial effects after oral administration of 100 mg MDMA or placebo. MDMA induced a robustincrease of blood oxytocin concentrations and an increase of subjective prosocialfeelings. Within subjects, the variations in these feelings were significantlyand positively correlated with variation in oxytocin levels, and the correlationsbetween these feelings and oxytocin were significantly stronger than thosebetween these feelings and blood MDMA levels. MDMA induces oxytocin release inhumans, which may be involved in the characteristic prosocial effects of ecstasy.
 Human automation interaction (HAI) systems have thus far failed to live up toexpectations mainly because human users do not always interact with theautomation appropriately. Trust in automation (TiA) has been considered a centralinfluence on the way a human user interacts with an automation; if TiA is toohigh there will be overuse, if TiA is too low there will be disuse. However, eventhough extensive research into TiA has identified specific HAI behaviors, ortrust outcomes, a unique mapping between trust states and trust outcomes has yet to be clearly identified. Interaction behaviors have been intensely studied inthe domain of HAI and TiA and this has led to a reframing of the issues ofproblems with HAI in terms of reliance and compliance. We find the behaviorallydefined terms reliance and compliance to be useful in their functionality forapplication in real-world situations. However, we note that once an inappropriateinteraction behavior has occurred it is too late to mitigate it. We thereforetake a step back and look at the interaction decision that precedes the behavior.We note that the decision neuroscience community has revealed that decisions are fairly stereotyped processes accompanied by measurable psychophysiologicalcorrelates. Two literatures were therefore reviewed. TiA literature wasextensively reviewed in order to understand the relationship between TiA andtrust outcomes, as well as to identify gaps in current knowledge. We note that aninteraction decision precedes an interaction behavior and believe that we canleverage knowledge of the psychophysiological correlates of decisions to improve joint system performance. As we believe that understanding the interactiondecision will be critical to the eventual mitigation of inappropriate interactionbehavior, we reviewed the decision making literature and provide a synopsis ofthe state of the art understanding of the decision process from a decisionneuroscience perspective. We forward hypotheses based on this understanding that could shape a research path toward the ability to mitigate interaction behaviorin the real world.
 Christianity strongly encourages its believers to surrender to God and to judgethe self from God's perspective. We used functional MRI to assess whether thisreligious belief is associated with neural correlates of self-referentialprocessing distinct from that of non-religious people. Non-religious andChristian participants were scanned while performing tasks of personal-traitjudgments regarding the self or public persons. We found that, whileself-judgment was linked to better memory of traits related to the self than toothers, self-referential processing induced increased activity in the ventralmedial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) for non-religious participants but in the dorsal MPFC for Christian participants. In addition, the dorsal MPFC activity waspositively correlated with the rating scores of the importance of Jesus' judgmentin subjective evaluation of a person's personality. Because the ventral anddorsal MPFC are respectively engaged in representation of stimulus self-relevanceand evaluation of self-referential stimuli, our findings suggest that Christianbeliefs result in weakened neural coding of stimulus self-relatedness butenhanced neural activity underlying evaluative processes applied toself-referential stimuli.
 Eyes are key social features providing a wealth of information about theattention, interest, emotion, and intention of others. Humans are typically very adept at detecting gaze direction, but there is a large decrement in gazediscrimination ability when eye images change from positive to negative polarity.This is thought to show an expert system for gaze perception that applies acontrast-specific heuristic to determine where someone else is looking. Autismspectrum conditions (ASC) are characterized by social deficits includingdifficulties in face-processing and in the social use of gaze. People with ASCare thought to have less expertise for gaze processing compared to typicalcontrols, though little research has tested this. We investigated gaze direction perception in typical males and females, and males with ASC using facial stimuli with positive or negative polarity of the eyes. Results showed that the ASC groupwas worse at judging gaze direction with positive stimuli, and showed less of adecrement in performance when eye stimuli changed from positive to negativepolarity. The differences in gaze perception for the ASC group were most evident when information from the eyes was more difficult and ambiguous. Typical females performed better at gaze direction detection with positive polarity than typical males, who in turn performed better than males with ASC. This latter finding isconsistent with the extreme male brain theory of autism, and with the idea thatpeople with ASC have less gaze expertise.
 Social science and neuroscience perspectives represent two ends of a continuum oflevels of organization studied in psychology. Human behavior as a whole unfoldsat social levels of organization, whereas much of the research in psychology has focused on cognitive and biological pieces of this whole. Recent evidenceunderscores the complementary nature of social, cognitive, and biological levels of analysis and how research integrating these levels can foster morecomprehensive theories of the mechanisms underlying complex behavior and themind. This research underscores the unity of psychology and the importance ofretaining multilevel integrative research that spans molar and molecular levelsof analysis.
 BACKGROUND: Heightened impulsivity has been suggested as a possible risk factorfor bipolar disorder (BD). However, studies on high-risk populations are scarceand have mainly focused on individuals with a genetic risk. The present studyinvestigated two high-risk samples for BD with regard to several aspects of theimpulsivity construct. METHODS: Unaffected relatives of BD patients (genetically defined high-risk group, N=29) and participants scoring high on the HypomanicPersonality Scale (psychometrically defined high-risk sample, N=25) were beingcompared to respective control groups (N=27 and N=25) using a multi-methodapproach. Participants were accessed on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11(BIS-11, trait impulsivity), the Stop Signal Task (response inhibition), and the Cambridge Gambling Task (impulsive behavior in decision-making processes).RESULTS: Both high-risk groups reported heightened impulsivity on the BIS-11, as well as impulsive decision-making, whereas no significant group differences inresponse inhibition were observed. LIMITATIONS: Limitations were the lack inspecificity of the results for BD and the cross-sectional study design, whichdoes not allow conclusions about the influence of impulsivity on the development of or resilience for BD in risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support theassumption that increased trait impulsivity and impulsive decision-making are avulnerability marker for and an endophenotype of BD.
 Neural oscillations are the intrinsic characteristics of brain activities.Traditional electrophysiological techniques (e.g., the steady-state evokedpotential, SSEP) have provided important insights into the mechanisms of neuraloscillations in the high frequency ranges (>1 Hz). However, the neuraloscillations within the low frequency ranges (<1 Hz) and deep brain areas arerarely examined. Based on the advantages of the low frequency blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fluctuations, we expected that the steady-state BOLD responses(SSBRs) would be elicited and modulate low frequency neural oscillations. Twenty six participants completed a simple reaction time task with the constant stimuli frequencies of 0.0625 Hz and 0.125 Hz. Power analysis and hemodynamic responsefunction deconvolution method were used to extract SSBRs and recover neural levelsignals. The SSEP-like waveforms were observed at the whole brain level and atseveral task-related brain regions. Specifically, the harmonic phenomenon of SSBRwas task-related and independent of the neurovascular coupling. These findingssuggested that the SSBRs represent non-linear neural oscillations but not brainactivations. In comparison with the conventional general linear model, the SSBRs provide us novel insights into the non-linear brain activities, low frequencyneural oscillations, and neuroplasticity of brain training and cognitiveactivities.
 During social interactions, there is a tendency for people to mimic the gestures and mannerisms of others, which increases liking and rapport. Psychologists have extensively studied the antecedents and consequences of mimicry at the sociallevel, but the neural basis of this behavior remains unclear. Many researchershave speculated that mimicry is related to activity in the human mirror system(HMS), a network of parietofrontal regions that are involved in both actionexecution and observation. However, activity of the HMS during reciprocal social interactions involving mimicry has not been demonstrated. Here, we took anelectroencephalographic (EEG) index of mirror activity-mu-suppression duringaction observation-in a pretest/post-test design with 1 of 3 interveningtreatments: 1) social interaction in which the participant was mimicked, 2)social interaction without mimicry, or 3) an innocuous computer task, notinvolving another human agent. The change in mu-suppression from pre- topost-test varied as a function of the intervening treatment, with participantswho had been mimicked showing an increase in mu-suppression during thepost-treatment action observation session. We propose that this specificmodulation of HMS activity as a function of mimicry constitutes the first direct evidence for mirror system involvement in real social mimicry.
 This systematic review aims to examine growing evidence linkingcognitive-executive functions with addiction treatment outcomes, and to discusssignificant cognitive predictors drawing upon addiction neuroscience theory. Weconducted a systematic search to identify studies using measures of generalcognition and executive functions in patients with substance use disorders forthe purpose of predicting two treatment outcomes: therapeutic adherence andrelapse. Forty-six studies were selected, and sample characteristics, timing ofassessments, and cognitive measures were analyzed. We observed significantmethodological differences across studies, resulting in substantial variabilityin the relationships between cognitive-executive domains and treatment outcomes. Notwithstanding this variability, we found evidence of associations, of mediumeffect size, between general cognition and treatment adherence, and betweenreward-based decision-making and relapse. The link between general cognition and treatment adherence is consistent with emerging evidence linking limitedcognitive-executive resources with less ability to benefit from talk therapies.The link between reward-based decision-making and relapse accords with decisionneuroscience models of addiction. Findings may inform preclinical and clinicalresearch concerning addiction treatment mechanisms.
 Emotion processing difficulties are observed in antisocial individuals exhibitingserious antisocial behavior. This study examined emotion processing in 40 malejuvenile offenders (JOs) and 52 male controls by measuring startle reflexresponses to aversive sounds during the passive viewing of affective and neutral images. JOs as a group exhibited reduced startle-elicited blinks across all slidecategories compared to normal controls. Moreover, within the offender group thosewith more conduct disorder symptoms and higher levels of psychopathic traitsdisplayed reduced startle amplitudes compared to lower-scoring offenders. Thefinding that startle magnitudes were inversely related to severity of conductproblems supports a dimensional or continuous approach to understandingexternalizing disorders. Reductions in amygdala activity could lead to bluntedstartle magnitudes. The current findings not only provide further evidence thatantisocial children have a general defensive motivational system dysfunction and present with impairments in neural systems that subserve emotion processing, but also show for the first time that those with more severe conduct problems havereduced startle responses compared to those who are less severely affected. Theimplications of these findings for interventions with JOs are discussed.
 Oxytocin receptors (OXTR) in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) promote alloparentalbehavior and partner preference formation in female prairie voles. Within theNAcc there is significant individual variation in OXTR binding and virginjuvenile and adult females with a high density of OXTR in the NAcc display anelevated propensity to engage in alloparental behavior toward novel pups.Over-expression of OXTR in the NAcc of adult female prairie voles using viralvector gene transfer facilitates partner preference formation, but has no effect on alloparental behavior, even though OXTR antagonists infused into the NAccblocks both behaviors. We therefore hypothesized that long-term increases in OXTRsignaling during development may underlie the relationship between adult OXTRdensity in the NAcc and alloparental behavior. To test this hypothesis, we usedviral vector gene transfer to increase OXTR density in the NAcc of prepubertal,21day old female prairie voles and tested for both alloparental behavior andpartner preference formation as adults. Consistent with a developmental impact ofOXTR signaling, adults over-expressing OXTR from weaning display both increasedalloparental behavior and partner preference formation. Thus, the relativelyacute impact of elevated OXTR signaling in the NAcc on partner preferenceformation previously reported appears to be dissociable from the effects oflonger term, developmentally relevant OXTR signaling necessary for modulatingalloparental behavior. These results are consistent with the hypothesis thatoxytocin can have both long-term "organizational" effects as well as acute"activational" effects on affiliative behaviors.
 Meditation is often associated with a relaxed state of the body. However,meditation can also be regarded as a type of mental task and training, associatedwith mental effort and physiological arousal. The cardiovascular effects ofmeditation may vary depending on the type of meditation, degree of mental effort,and amount of training. In the current study we assessed heart rate (HR),high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) and subjective ratings of effortand likeability during three types of meditation varying in their cognitive andattentional requirements, namely breathing meditation, loving-kindness meditationand observing-thoughts meditation. In the context of the ReSource project, aone-year longitudinal mental training study, participants practiced eachmeditation exercise on a daily basis for 3 months. As expected HR and effort werehigher during loving-kindness meditation and observing-thoughts meditationcompared to breathing meditation. With training over time HR and likeabilityincreased, while HF-HRV and the subjective experience of effort decreased. Theincrease in HR and decrease in HF-HRV over training was higher forloving-kindness meditation and observing-thoughts meditation compared tobreathing meditation. In contrast to implicit beliefs that meditation is alwaysrelaxing and associated with low arousal, the current results show that coremeditations aiming at improving compassion and meta-cognitive skills requireeffort and are associated with physiological arousal compared to breathingmeditation. Overall these findings can be useful in making more specificsuggestions about which type of meditation is most adaptive for a given contextand population.
 To identify the brain regions involved in the interpretation of intentionalmovement by patients with schizophrenia, we investigated the association between cerebral gray matter (GM) volumes and performance on a theory of mind (ToM) task using voxel-based morphometry. Eighteen patients with schizophrenia and thirtyhealthy controls participated in the study. Participants were given a movingshapes task that employs the interpretation of intentional movement. Verbaldescriptions were rated according to intentionality. ToM performance deficits in patients were found to be positively correlated with GM volume reductions in the superior temporal sulcus and medial prefrontal cortex. Our findings confirm that divergent brain regions contribute to mentalizing abilities and that GM volumereductions impact behavioral deficits in patients with schizophrenia.
 BACKGROUND: In some fields of fMRI data analysis, using correct methods fordealing with noise is crucial for achieving meaningful results. This paperprovides a quantitative assessment of the effects of different preprocessing and noise filtering strategies on psychophysiological interactions (PPI) methods for analyzing fMRI data where noise management has not yet been established. METHODS:Both real and simulated fMRI data were used to assess these effects. Four regionsof interest (ROIs) were chosen for the PPI analysis on the basis of theirengagement during two tasks. PPI analysis was performed for 32 differentpreprocessing and analysis settings, which included data filtering with RETROICORor no such filtering; different filtering of the ROI "seed" signal with anuisance data-driven time series; and the involvement of these data-driven timeseries in the subsequent PPI GLM analysis. The extent of the statisticallysignificant results was quantified at the group level using simple descriptivestatistics. Simulated data were generated to assess statistical improvement ofdifferent filtering strategies. RESULTS: We observed that different approachesfor dealing with noise in PPI analysis yield differing results in real data. Insimulated data, we found RETROICOR, seed signal filtering and the addition ofdata-driven covariates to the PPI design matrix significantly improves results.CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the use of RETROICOR, and data-driven filtering of the whole data, or alternatively, seed signal filtering with data-driven signals and the addition of data-driven covariates to the PPI design matrix.
 Conforming to the majority can be seen as a heuristic type of judgment, as itallows the individual to easily choose the most accurate or most sociallyacceptable type of behavior. People who process the currently to-be-judged items in a superficial, heuristic way should tend to conform to group judgment morethan people processing these items in a systematic and elaborate way. Weinvestigated this hypothesis using electroencephalography (EEG), analyzingwhether the strength of neural encoding of faces was related to the tendency toadopt a group's evaluative judgments regarding these faces. As expected, we foundthat the amplitude of the N170, a specific neural correlate of face encoding, wasinversely related to conformity across participants: The weaker the faces wereencoded, the more the majority response regarding the faces' attractiveness wasadopted instead of relying on the actual qualities of the faces. Applyingneurophysiological methodology, we thus provide support for previous claims,based on behavioral data and theorizing, that social conformity is a heuristictype of judgment. We propose that weak encoding of judgment-relevant information is a typical, possibly even necessary, precursor of socially adjusted judgments, irrespective of one's current motivational goal (i.e., to be accurate oraccepted).
 The detection of one's deviance from social norms is an essential mechanism ofindividual adjustment to group behavior and, thus, for the perpetuation of norms within groups. It has been suggested that error signals in mediofrontal cortexprovide the neural basis of such deviance detection, which contributes to lateradjustment to the norm. In the present study, we used event-related potentials(ERPs) to demonstrate that, across participants, the strength of mediofrontalbrain correlates of the detection of deviance from a peer group's norms wasnegatively related to attentive processing of the same group's judgments in alater task. We propose that an individual's perception of social deviance mightbias basic cognitive processing during further interaction with the group.Strongly perceiving disagreement with a group could cause an individual to avoid or inhibit this group's judgments.
 The waking mind is often occupied with mental contents that are minimallyconstrained by events in the here and now. These self-generated thoughts-e.g.,mind-wandering or daydreaming-interfere with external task performance and can bea marker for unhappiness and even psychiatric problems. They also occupy ourthoughts for upwards of half of the time, and under non-demanding conditions they(i) allow us to connect our past and future selves together, (ii) help us makesuccessful long-term plans and (iii) can provide a source of creativeinspiration. The lengths that the mind goes to self-generate thought, coupledwith its apparent functionality, suggest that the mind places a higher priorityon such cognition than on many other mental acts. Although mind-wandering may be unpleasant for the individual who experiences it and disruptive to the tasks ofthe moment, self-generated thought allows consciousness freedom from the here andnow and so reflects a key evolutionary adaptation for the mind. Here wesynthesize recent literature from cognitive and clinical psychology and proposetwo formal hypotheses that (1) highlight task context and thought content ascritical factors that constrain the costs and benefits of self-generated thought and (2) provide direction on ways to investigate the costs and benefits from animpartial perspective.
 Tendency to mimic others' emotional facial expressions predicts empathy and mayrepresent a physiological marker of psychopathy. Anatomical connectivity between amygdala, cingulate motor cortex (M3, M4), and facial nucleus demonstrates apotential neuroanatomical substrate for mimicry, though pharmacologicalinfluences are largely unknown. Norepinephrine modulation selectively impairsnegative emotion recognition, reflecting a potential role in processingempathy-eliciting facial expressions. We examined effects of single doses ofpropranolol (beta-adrenoceptor blocker) and reboxetine (selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) on automatic facial mimicry of sadness, anger, and happiness,and the relationship between mimicry and empathy. Forty-five healthy volunteerswere randomized to 40 mg propranolol or 4 mg reboxetine. Two hours after drugsubjects viewed and rated facial expressions of sadness, anger, and happiness,while corrugator, zygomatic, and mentalis EMG were recorded. Trait emotionalempathy was measured using the Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale. EMG confirmedemotion-specific mimicry and the relationship between corrugator mimicry andempathy. Norepinephrine modulation did not alter mimicry to any expression orinfluence the relationship between mimicry and empathy. Corrugator but notzygomaticus mimicry predicts trait empathy, consistent with greater anatomicalconnectivity between amygdala and M3 coding upper facial muscle representations. Although influencing emotion perception, norepinephrine does not influenceemotional facial mimicry or its relationship with trait empathy.
 Santiago Ramon y Cajal (1852-1934) did not only contribute to neurobiology andneurohistology. At the end of the 19th century, he published one of the firstclinical reports on the employment of hypnotic suggestion to induce analgesia(hypnoanalgesia) in order to relieve pain in childbirth. Today, the clinicalapplication of hypnoanalgesia is considered an effective technique for thetreatment of pain in medicine, dentistry, and psychology. However, the knowledge we have today on the neural and cognitive underpinnings of hypnotic suggestionhas increased dramatically since Cajal's times. Here we review the maincontributions of Cajal to hypnoanalgesia and the current knowledge we have about hypnoanalgesia from neural and cognitive perspectives.
 The weighing of intentions and consequences is inconsistent in adult's moraljudgments, and this is particularly prominent when assigning blame to the immoralintentions in the absence of negative outcomes. The current study extendsprevious research by examining how individual differences in moral judgmentcompetence are reflected in the cortical network when making judgments aboutimmoral intentions. Twenty-four participants were scanned, using functionalmagnetic resonance imaging, while making judgments about three kinds of moralscenarios: a neutral condition, an immoral intention condition, and an immoralcondition. The result showed that comparing with making judgments about the othertwo conditions, making judgments about the immoral intentions takes longer timeand was associated with significantly elevated activity in the dorsolateralprefrontal cortex and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Additionally, moraljudgment competence scores were inversely correlated with activity in the rightdorsolateral prefrontal cortex when assigning blame to the immoral intentions.Greater activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in participants withlower moral judgment competence possibly reflected increased recruitment ofcognitive resource applied to control impulsive response and integratecompetitive information in making judgments about the immoral intention.
 Cognitive neuroscience, as a discipline, links the biological systems studied by neuroscience to the processing constructs studied by psychology. By mapping theserelations throughout the literature of cognitive neuroscience, we visualize thesemantic structure of the discipline and point to directions for future research that will advance its integrative goal. For this purpose, network text analyseswere applied to an exhaustive corpus of abstracts collected from five majorjournals over a 30-month period, including every study that used fMRI toinvestigate psychological processes. From this, we generate network maps thatillustrate the relationships among psychological and anatomical terms, along withcentrality statistics that guide inferences about network structure. Threeterms--prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex--dominate thenetwork structure with their high frequency in the literature and the density of their connections with other neuroanatomical terms. From network statistics, weidentify terms that are understudied compared with their importance in thenetwork (e.g., insula and thalamus), are underspecified in the language of thediscipline (e.g., terms associated with executive function), or are imperfectlyintegrated with other concepts (e.g., subdisciplines like decision neurosciencethat are disconnected from the main network). Taking these results as the basisfor prescriptive recommendations, we conclude that semantic analyses provideuseful guidance for cognitive neuroscience as a discipline, both by illustrating systematic biases in the conduct and presentation of research and by identifying directions that may be most productive for future research.
 The neurophysiological study of emotion regulation focused on the strategy ofreappraisal-i.e., the cognitive reinterpretation of a stimulus. Reappraisalreduces emotional expression, the experience of both negative and positivefeelings, and the amplitude of an event-related potential (ERP)-the late positivepotential (LPP). In contrast, the strategy of expressive suppression (ES), being the inhibition of emotional expression, has been reported to reduce subjectivefeelings of positive, but not negative emotion, and has not yet been investigatedwith ERPs. We focused on the LPP to assess the correlates of ES in the context ofhumor perception. Twenty-two female participants rated sequences of humorous (H) and non-humorous (NH) pictures, while their zygomaticus muscle was recorded. Aspontaneous (SP) condition, in which participants attended naturally to thepictures, resulted in higher ratings of funniness, increased smiling, andincreased LPP amplitude for H compared to NH stimuli. An ES condition, in whichparticipants suppressed their facial reactions, resulted in reduced smiling,without affecting subjective ratings. LPP amplitude did not differ between H and NH stimuli during ES, suggesting equal allocation of processing resources to bothstimuli. These results suggest that, similarly to reappraisal, ES modifies theway the brain processes positive emotional stimuli.
 Monitoring one's own errors is a fundamental ability in terms of guiding andimproving behavior, with specific neural substrates in the anterior cingulatecortex (ACC). Similarly, we can monitor others' actions and learn by observingtheir errors. The mirror neuron system may subserve the formation of sharedrepresentations for self-generated and observed actions, and recent researchsuggests that monitoring mechanisms also react to errors made by others. However,it remains unknown how these responses are modified when interpersonal contextimplies different goals for the actor and the observer. To investigate whetherdifferences in social context can influence brain response to observed actionerrors, we manipulated competition vs. cooperation between two participantstaking turns in a go/no-go task. Event-related potentials simultaneously recordedfrom both participants showed a typical negativity over frontocentral regions to self-generated errors, irrespective of interpersonal context, but earlydifferential responses to other-generated errors only during cooperation, withsources in precuneus and medial premotor areas. Competition produced a distincterror-related negativity in ACC at later latencies. We conclude that errormonitoring for others' actions depends on their congruence with personal goals,and recruits brain systems involved in self-referential processing specificallyduring cooperation.
 Gambling is a harmless, recreational pastime that is ubiquitous across cultures. However, for some, gambling becomes a maladaptive and compulsive, and thissyndrome is conceptualized as a behavioural addiction. Laboratory models thatcapture the key cognitive processes involved in gambling behaviour, and that can be translated across species, have the potential to make an importantcontribution to both decision neuroscience and the study of addictive disorders. The Iowa gambling task has been widely used to assess human decision-making underuncertainty, and this paradigm can be successfully modelled in rodents. Similarneurobiological processes underpin choice behaviour in humans and rats, and thus,a preference for the disadvantageous "high-risk, high-reward" options may reflectmeaningful vulnerability for mental health problems. However, the choicebehaviour operationalized by these tasks does not necessarily approximate thevulnerability to gambling disorder (GD) per se. We consider a number ofpsychological challenges that apply to modelling gambling in a translational way,and evaluate the success of the existing models. Heterogeneity in the structureof gambling games, as well as in the motivations of individuals with GD, ishighlighted. The potential issues with extrapolating too directly fromestablished animal models of drug dependency are discussed, as are the inherentdifficulties in validating animal models of GD in the absence of any approvedtreatments for GD. Further advances in modelling the cognitive biases endemic in human decision-making, which appear to be exacerbated in GD, may be a promisingline of research.
 Asymmetrical frontal electroencephalography (EEG) activity is associated withmotivational neural systems of approach/withdrawal behaviors. Greater leftfrontal EEG has been linked to increased appetitive tendencies whereas increased right frontal activity is related to the activation of avoidance mechanisms.Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic condition characterized by a highly sociable personality manifested by a propensity to approach strangers and decreased socialfear. Consequently, the current study was designed to investigate the frontalcortical activity during resting state, indexed by relative alpha power, inadults with WS as compared to typically developing (TD) controls, and a subgroup of TD extraverts. Results indicated that participants with WS produced attenuatedleft frontal activity relative to TD peers, or TD extraverts in particular; yet, no groups differed in their degree of right frontal activity. Finally, while bothTD group and the extravert subset showed trends of greater left over rightfrontal activity, the WS participants demonstrated opposing effect of increasedright over left frontal EEG. Importantly, individuals with WS produced deviating frontal activity patterns compared to TD extraverts despite exhibiting commonsocial-affiliative tendencies, underscoring that neural mechanisms that give riseto extraversion in WS may not function similarly to those subserving thispersonality trait expressed in TD.
 Interoceptive body awareness (IA) is crucial for psychological well-being andplays an important role in many contemplative traditions. However, untilrecently, standardized self-report measures of IA were scarce, not comprehensive,and the effects of interoceptive training on such measures were largely unknown. The Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) questionnairemeasures IA with eight different scales. In the current study, we investigatedwhether and how these different aspects of IA are influenced by a 3-monthscontemplative intervention in the context of the ReSource project, in which 148subjects engaged in daily practices of "Body Scan" and "Breath Meditation." Wedeveloped a German version of the MAIA and tested it in a large and diversesample (n = 1,076). Internal consistencies were similar to the English version(0.56-0.89), retest reliability was high (rs: 0.66-0.79), and the MAIA showedgood convergent and discriminant validity. Importantly, interoceptive trainingimproved five out of eight aspects of IA, compared to a retest control group.Participants with low IA scores at baseline showed the biggest changes. Whereaspractice duration only weakly predicted individual differences in change,self-reported liking of the practices and degree of integration into daily lifepredicted changes on most scales. Interestingly, the magnitude of observedchanges varied across scales. The strongest changes were observed for theregulatory aspects of IA, that is, how the body is used for self-regulation indaily life. No significant changes were observed for the Noticing aspect(becoming aware of bodily changes), which is the aspect that is predominantlyassessed in other IA measures. This differential pattern underscores theimportance to assess IA multi-dimensionally, particularly when interested inenhancement of IA through contemplative practice or other mind-bodyinterventions.
 The present research explored the relationship between different measures ofdisorders of consciousness (DOC), that is electrophysiological measures (ERPN400, event-related potentials) and clinical measures (Coma Near Coma, CNC;Disability Rating Scale, DRS). This analysis aimed to verify the preservation of semantic linguistic processes in eighteen patients with DOC. Patients inminimally conscious state (MCS) and in vegetative state (VS) were compared withrespect of N400 amplitude and latency measures. They were submitted to anassociative auditory task that included congruous (related final words) orincongruous (unrelated final words) word sequences. Firstly, an increased N400peak amplitude within the fronto-central cortical areas was revealed in response to incongruous sequences for all patients. Moreover, this peak was temporallydelayed in response to incongruous conditions in these cortical sites. Inaddition, patients in VS showed a delayed N400 in comparison with patients in MCSin incongruous condition. Secondly, a direct correlation was found between theclinical scales and the ERP modulation, in terms of peak amplitude and latency.Thus the present results were discussed taking into account the significance ofN400 as a marker of semantic processes in patients with DOC. Secondly it wasunderlined that this cognitive covert process may be demonstrated also inpatients who show significant impairment in overt behavior (as in VS or MCS).Finally it was suggested to use ERP measure to improve the diagnostic profile in cases of DOC.
 The discovery of mirror neurons in monkeys, and the finding of motor activityduring action observation in humans are generally regarded to support motortheories of action understanding. These theories take motor resonance to beessential in the understanding of observed actions and the inference of actiongoals. However, the notions of "resonance," "action understanding," and "actiongoal" appear to be used ambiguously in the literature. A survey of the literatureon mirror neurons and motor resonance yields two different interpretations of theterm "resonance," three different interpretations of action understanding, andagain three different interpretations of what the goal of an action is. Thisentails that, unless it is specified what interpretation is used, the meaning of any statement about the relation between these concepts can differ to a greatextent. By discussing an experiment we will show that more precise definitionsand use of the concepts will allow for better assessments of motor theories ofaction understanding and hence a more fruitful scientific debate. Lastly, we willprovide an example of how the discussed experimental setup could be adapted totest other interpretations of the concepts.
 Although neuroscience has made remarkable progress in understanding theinvolvement of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in human memory, the necessity ofdorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) for key competencies of working memory remains largelyunexplored. We therefore studied human brain lesion patients to determine whetherdlPFC is necessary for working memory function, administering subtests of theWechsler Memory Scale, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and the N-Back Taskto three participant groups: dlPFC lesions (n=19), non-dlPFC lesions (n=152), andno brain lesions (n=54). DlPFC damage was associated with deficits in themanipulation of verbal and spatial knowledge, with left dlPFC necessary formanipulating information in working memory and right dlPFC critical formanipulating information in a broader range of reasoning contexts. Our findingselucidate the architecture of working memory, providing key neuropsychologicalevidence for the necessity of dlPFC in the manipulation of verbal and spatialknowledge.
 Causal reasoning is a ubiquitous feature of human cognition. We continuously seekto understand, at least implicitly and often explicitly, the causal scenarios in which we live, so that we may anticipate what will come next, plan a potentialresponse and envision its outcome, decide among possible courses of action inlight of their probable outcomes, make midstream adjustments in our goal-related activities as our situation changes, and so on. A considerable body of researchshows that the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) is crucial for causal reasoning,but also that there are significant differences in the manner in whichventrolateral PFC, dorsolateral PFC, and anterolateral PFC support causalreasoning. We propose, on the basis of research on the evolution, architecture,and functional organization of the lateral PFC, a general framework forunderstanding its roles in the many and varied sorts of causal reasoning carried out by human beings. Specifically, the ventrolateral PFC supports the generation of basic causal explanations and inferences; dorsolateral PFC supports theevaluation of these scenarios in light of some given normative standard (e.g., ofplausibility or correctness in light of real or imagined causal interventions);and anterolateral PFC supports explanation and inference at an even higher level of complexity, coordinating the processes of generation and evaluation withfurther cognitive processes, and especially with computations of hedonic valueand emotional implications of possible behavioral scenarios - considerations thatare often critical both for understanding situations causally and for decidingabout our own courses of action.
 Humans are frequently confronted with goal-directed tasks that can not beaccomplished alone, or that benefit from co-operation with other agents. Therelatively new field of social cognitive neuroscience seeks to characterizefunctional neuroanatomical systems either specifically or preferentially engaged during such joint-action tasks. Based on neuroimaging experiments conducted oncritical components of joint action, the current paper outlines the functionalnetwork upon which joint action is hypothesized to be dependant. This networkincludes brain areas likely to be involved in interpersonal co-ordination at the action, goal, and intentional levels. Experiments focusing specifically onjoint-action situations similar to those encountered in real life are required tofurther specify this model.
 With its ease of availability during adolescence, sweetened ethanol ('alcopops') is consumed within many contexts. We asked here whether genetically baseddifferences in social motivation are associated with how the adolescent socialenvironment impacts voluntary ethanol intake. Mice with previously describeddifferences in sociability (BALB/cJ, C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ and MSM/MsJ strains) wereweaned into isolation or same-sex pairs (postnatal day, PD, 21), and then givencontinuous access to two fluids on PDs 34-45: one containing water and the other containing an ascending series of saccharin-sweetened ethanol (3-6-10%). Prior tothe introduction of ethanol (PDs 30-33), increased water and food intake wasdetected in some of the isolation-reared groups, and controls indicated thatisolated mice also consumed more 'saccharin-only' solution. Voluntary drinking of'ethanol-only' was also higher in a subset of the isolated groups on PDs 46-49.However, sweetened ethanol intake was increased in all isolated strain x sexcombinations irrespective of genotype. Surprisingly, blood ethanol concentration (BEC) was not different between these isolate and socially housed groups 4 h intothe dark phase. Using lickometer-based measures of intake in FVB mice, weidentified that a predominance of increased drinking during isolation transpired outside of the typical circadian consumption peak, occurring approximately 8.5 h into the dark phase, with an associated difference in BEC. These findingscollectively indicate that isolate housing leads to increased consumption ofrewarding substances in adolescent mice independent of their genotype, and thatfor ethanol this may be because of when individuals drink during the circadiancycle.
 The topics of emotion, decision-making, and consciousness have been traditionallydealt with in the humanities and social sciences. With the dissemination ofnoninvasive human neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI and the advancement ofcognitive science, neuroimaging studies focusing on emotions, social cognition,and decision-making have become established. I overviewed the history of socialneurosciences. The emerging field of social brain research or social neurosciencewill greatly contribute to clinical psychiatry. In the first part. I introducedour early fMRI studies on social emotions such as guilt, embarrassment, pride,and envy. Dysfunction of social emotions can be observed in various forms ofpsychiatric disorder, and the findings should contribute to a betterunderstanding of the pathophysiology of psychiatric conditions. In the secondpart, I introduced our recent interdisciplinary neuroscience approach combiningmolecular neuroimaging techniques(positron emission tomography: PET), cognitivesciences, and economics to understand the neural as well as molecular basis ofaltered decision-making in neuropsychiatric disorders. An interdisciplinaryapproach combing molecular imaging techniques and cognitive neuroscience andclinical psychiatry will provide new perspectives for understanding theneurobiology of impaired decision-making in neuropsychiatric disorders and drugdevelopment.
 Previous studies suggest the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is involvedin processing of empathic concern. This has not been experimentally tested todate. We tested the hypotheses that electrical potentiation in the right DLPFCwould be associated with increased empathic concern and prosocial behavior.Participants were randomly allocated to one of three transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) conditions: (a) relative right potentiation, (b) relative leftpotentiation, and (c) sham. Participants viewed images of African children indistressing circumstances, and completed measures of empathic concern pre- andpost-tDCS manipulation. Contrary to our prediction, neither effects, norinteractions of heightened empathic concern were observed. These results conflictwith previous studies using this bilateral tDCS montage. Explanations could bethat stimulation used in this study had been simply too weak (1.5 mA).Alternatively, the area of the DLPFC involved in emotion regulation is closer to the cortex than the area involved in empathic concern, and more easilypotentiated by tDCS. Therefore, the DLPFC potentiation in the present study mayhave linked empathic concern with adaptive emotion regulation strategies. Future research could examine this possibility using measures of emotion regulation and higher fidelity neurostimulation (e.g., repetitive Transcranial MagneticStimulation [rTMS]).
 The aim of this study was to investigate if and how temporal context influencessubjective affective responses to emotional images. To do so, we examined whetherthe subjective evaluation of a target image is influenced by the valence of itspreceding image, and/or its overall position in a sequence of images.Furthermore, we assessed if these potentially confounding contextual effects can be moderated by a common procedural control: randomized stimulus presentation.Four groups of participants evaluated the same set of 120 pictures from theInternational Affective System (IAPS) presented in four different sequences. Our data reveal strong effects of both aspects of temporal context in allpresentation sequences, modified only slightly in their nature and magnitude.Furthermore, this was true for both valence and arousal ratings. Subjectiveratings of negative target images were influenced by temporal context moststrongly across all sequences. We also observed important gender differences:females expressed greater sensitivity to temporal-context effects and designmanipulations relative to males, especially for negative images. Our results haveimportant implications for future emotion research that employs normative picturestimuli, and contributes to our understanding of context effects in general.
 The motive to achieve success (MAS) and motive to avoid failure (MAF) are twodifferent but classical kinds of achievement motivation. Though many functionalmagnetic resonance imaging studies have explored functional activation inmotivation-related conditions, research has been silent as to the brainstructures associated with individual differences in achievement motivation,especially with respect to MAS and MAF. In this study, the voxel-basedmorphometry method was used to uncover focal differences in brain structuresrelated to MAS and MAF measured by the Mehrabian Achieving Tendency Scale in 353 healthy young Chinese adults. The results showed that the brain structuresassociated with individual differences in MAS and MAF were distinct. MAS wasnegatively correlated with regional gray matter volume (rGMV) in the medialprefrontal cortex (mPFC)/orbitofrontal cortex while MAF was negatively correlatedwith rGMV in the mPFC/subgenual cingulate gyrus. After controlling for mutualinfluences of MAS and MAF scores, MAS scores were found to be related to rGMV in the mPFC/orbitofrontal cortex and another cluster containing the parahippocampal gyrus and precuneus. These results may predict that compared with MAF, thegeneration process of MAS may be more complex and rational, thus in the realworld, perhaps MAS is more beneficial to personal growth and guaranteeing thequality of task performance.
 In the neurosciences, two alternative regimes of visualization can bedifferentiated: anatomical preparations for morphological images andphysiological studies for functional representations. Adapting a distinctionproposed by Peter Galison, this duality of visualization regimes is analyzed hereas the contrast between an imaging and a writing approach: the imaging approach, focusing on mimetic representations, preserving material and spatial relations,and the writing approach as used in physiological studies, retaining functionalrelations. After a dominance of morphological images gathering iconicrepresentations of brains and architectural brain theories, the advent ofelectroencephalography advanced writing approaches with their indexical signs.Addressing the brain allegedly at its mode of operation, electroencephalographywas conceived as recording the brain's intrinsic language, extending the writing approach to include symbolic signs. The availability of functional neuroimagingsignaled an opportunity to overcome the duality of imaging and writing, butrevived initially a phrenological conflation of form and function, suppressingthe writing approach in relation to imaging. More sophisticated visualizationmodes, however, converted this reductionism to the ontological productivity ofsocial neuroscience and recuperated the theorizing from the writing approach. In light of the ongoing instrumental mediations between brains, data and theories,the question of how we may think, once proposed by Vannevar Bush as a prospect ofenhanced human-machine interaction, has become the state of affairs in theentanglements of instruments and organic worlds.
 The present study examined possible neural mechanisms underlying increased socialinterest in persons with Williams syndrome (WS). Visual event-related potentials (ERPs) during passive viewing were used to compare incidental memory traces forrepeated vs. single presentations of previously unfamiliar social (faces) andnonsocial (houses) images in 26 adults with WS and 26 typical adults. Resultsindicated that participants with WS developed familiarity with the repeated facesand houses (frontal N400 response), but only typical adults evidenced theparietal old/new effect (previously associated with stimulus recollection) forthe repeated faces. There was also no evidence of exceptional salience of social information in WS, as ERP markers of memory for repeated faces vs. houses werenot significantly different. Thus, while persons with WS exhibit behavioralevidence of increased social interest, their processing of social information in the absence of specific instructions may be relatively superficial. The ERPevidence of face repetition detection in WS was independent of IQ and the earlierperceptual differentiation of social vs. nonsocial stimuli. Large individualdifferences in ERPs of participants with WS may provide valuable information for understanding the WS phenotype and have relevance for educational and treatmentpurposes.
 Functional brain imaging has been considered a new and better technique for thedetection of deception. The reasoning is that there is a neural locus or circuit for lying that is sensitive, specific, generalizable across individuals andmeasurement contexts, and robust to countermeasures. To determine the extent towhich the group results predicted lying at the level of the individual, wereanalyzed data on 14 participants from a study that had previously identifiedregions involved in lying (thus satisfying the criterion for sensitivity). Weassessed the efficacy of functionally determined brain regions based on thelie-truth contrast for N-1 participants to detect deception in the Nthindividual. Results showed that no region could be used to correctly detectdeception across all individuals. The best results were obtained for medialprefrontal cortex (mPFC), correctly identifying 71% of participants as lying withno false alarms. Lowering the threshold for a response increased hits and falsealarms. The results suggest that although brain imaging is a more direct index ofcognition than the traditional polygraph, it is subject to many of the samecaveats and thus neuroimaging does not appear to reveal processes that arenecessarily unique to deception.
 We examined how individual differences in mood and anxiety in the earlypostpartum period are related to brain response to infant stimuli during fMRI,with particular focus on regions implicated in both maternal behavior andmood/anxiety, that is, the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) and theamygdala. At approximately 3 months postpartum, 22 mothers completed anaffect-rating task (ART) during fMRI, where their affective response to infantstimuli was explicitly probed. Mothers viewed/rated four infant face conditions: own positive (OP), own negative (ON), unfamiliar positive (UP), and unfamiliarnegative (UN). Mood and anxiety were measured by the Edinburgh PostnatalDepression Scale (EDPS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Version(STAI-T); maternal factors related to parental stress and attachment were alsoassessed. Brain-imaging data underwent a random-effects analysis, andcluster-based statistical thresholding was applied to the following contrasts:OP-UP, ON-UN, OP-ON, and UP-UN. Our main finding was that poorer quality ofmaternal experience was significantly related to reduced amygdala response to OP compared to UP infant faces. Our results suggest that, in human mothers,infant-related amygdala function may be an important factor in maternalanxiety/mood, in quality of mothering, and in individual differences in themotivation to mother. We are very grateful to the staff at the Imaging ResearchCenter of the Brain-Body Institute for their contributions to this project. This work was supported by an Ontario Mental Health Foundation operating grant awardedto Alison Fleming and a postdoctoral fellowship awarded to Jennifer Barrett.
 Recent research in social neuroscience proposes a link between mirror neuronsystem (MNS) and social cognition. The MNS has been proposed to be the neuralmechanism underlying action recognition and intention understanding and morebroadly social cognition. Pre-motor MNS has been suggested to modulate the motor cortex during action observation. This modulation results in an enhancedcortico-motor excitability reflected in increased motor evoked potentials (MEPs) at the muscle of interest during action observation. Anomalous MNS activity hasbeen reported in the autistic population whose social skills are notablyimpaired. It is still an open question whether traits of autism in the normalpopulation are linked to the MNS functioning. We measured TMS-induced MEPs innormal individuals with high and low traits of autism as measured by the autisticquotient (AQ), while observing videos of hand or mouth actions, static images of a hand or mouth or a blank screen. No differences were observed between the twowhile they observed a blank screen. However participants with low traits ofautism showed significantly greater MEP amplitudes during observation ofhand/mouth actions relative to static hand/mouth stimuli. In contrast,participants with high traits of autism did not show such a MEP amplitudedifference between observation of actions and static stimuli. These results arediscussed with reference to MNS functioning.
 This article reviews research on cognition, language, organizational culture,brain, behavior, and evolution to posit the value of operating with a stablereference point based on cognitive accuracy and a rational bias. Drawing onrational-emotive behavioral science, social neuroscience, and cognitiveorganizational science on the one hand and a general model of brain and frontallobe executive function on the other, I suggest implications for organizationalsuccess. Cognitive thought processes depend on specific brain structuresfunctioning as effectively as possible under conditions of cognitive accuracy.However, typical cognitive processes in hierarchical business structures promote the adoption and application of subjective organizational beliefs and, thus,cognitive inaccuracies. Applying informed frontal lobe executive functioning tocognition, emotion, and organizational behavior helps minimize the negativeeffects of indiscriminate application of personal and cultural belief systems to business. Doing so enhances cognitive accuracy and improves communication andcooperation. Organizations operating with cognitive accuracy will tend to respondmore nimbly to market pressures and achieve an overall higher level ofperformance and employee satisfaction.
 Consolation behavior toward distressed others is common in humans and great apes,yet our ability to explore the biological mechanisms underlying this behavior is limited by its apparent absence in laboratory animals. Here, we provide empiricalevidence that a rodent species, the highly social and monogamous prairie vole(Microtus ochrogaster), greatly increases partner-directed grooming towardfamiliar conspecifics (but not strangers) that have experienced an unobservedstressor, providing social buffering. Prairie voles also match the fear response,anxiety-related behaviors, and corticosterone increase of the stressed cagemate, suggesting an empathy mechanism. Exposure to the stressed cagemate increasesactivity in the anterior cingulate cortex, and oxytocin receptor antagonistinfused into this region abolishes the partner-directed response, showingconserved neural mechanisms between prairie vole and human.
 UNLABELLED: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative brain disorderthat affects the frontal and temporal lobes predominantly. Impaired emotionrecognition has been reported in two FTD subtypes: behavioral-variant FTD (bvFTD)and semantic dementia (SD), but has not been investigated in the third subtype:progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). METHODS: Recognition of six basic facialemotions (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise, and happiness) wasinvestigated in 41 FTD patients (bvFTD = 16; SD = 12; PNFA = 13) and 37 age- and education-matched controls, using two tests. In one task, intensity of emotional expression was increased to identify cognitive components contributing to emotionrecognition performance. RESULTS: All patient groups demonstrated impairedoverall facial emotion recognition compared to controls. Performance, however,improved with increased emotion intensity in bvFTD and PNFA groups, the effect ofintensity on emotion recognition being particularly pronounced for negativeemotions. In contrast, increased intensity of facial emotion did not changeperformance in SD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SD demonstrate a primary emotionprocessing impairment, whereas PNFA and bvFTD patients' emotional disturbance is in part mediated by attentional deficits. These findings indicate that a subsetof FTD patients may benefit from enhanced emotional intensity that willfacilitate facial emotion recognition.
 Although we often seek social feedback (SFB) from others to help us makedecisions, little is known about how SFB affects decisions under risk,particularly from a close peer. We conducted two experiments using an establishedframing task to probe how decision-making is modulated by SFB valence (positive, negative) and the level of closeness with feedback provider (friend,confederate). Participants faced mathematically equivalent decisions framed aseither an opportunity to keep (gain frame) or lose (loss frame) part of aninitial endowment. Periodically, participants were provided with positive (e.g., "Nice!") or negative (e.g., "Lame!") feedback about their choices. Such feedback was provided by either a confederate (Experiment 1) or a gender-matched closefriend (Experiment 2). As expected, the framing effect was observed in bothexperiments. Critically, an individual's susceptibility to the framing effect wasmodulated by the valence of the SFB, but only when the feedback provider was aclose friend. This effect was reflected in the activation patterns ofventromedial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, regions involvedin complex decision-making. Taken together, these results highlight socialcloseness as an important factor in understanding the impact of SFB on neuralmechanisms of decision-making.
 Social psychology and psychobiology have a rich historical connection, althoughover the last half century these two disciplines have seemingly become estranged.To a significant extent, that alienation arose from an archaic and nonviablemodel of behavioral biology that retarded the development of both disciplines.With the emergence of modern biological perspectives, this impediment no longerlimits fruitful collaborations among social psychologists and psychobiologists.Indeed, some of the most exciting contemporary developments are emerging from theareas of social neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, and behavioralneuroscience. We review the history of links between social psychology andpsychobiology, the factors that led to the segregation of these subdisciplines,and the modern biological perspectives that provide the basis for reintegrationof these disciplines.
 According to the neuronal recycling hypothesis, brain circuits can gain newfunctions through cultural learning, which are distinct from their evolutionarilyestablished functions, creating competition between processes such as facial and identifiable character processing. In the present study, event-related potential (ERP) recording was used to examine electrophysiological correlates ofidentification levels of Chinese characters as well as the competition betweenfacial and Chinese character processing after the characters were learnt. Twenty volunteers performed a lateralized face detection task, and N170 responses wererecorded when the participants viewed only Chinese characters (identifiable orunidentifiable in Xiaozhuan font), or Chinese characters and faces concurrently. Viewing identifiable Chinese characters bilaterally elicited larger N170amplitudes than viewing unidentifiable ones. N170 amplitudes in response to facesbilaterally declined when identifiable Chinese characters and faces were viewedconcurrently as compared to viewing unidentifiable Chinese characters and facesconcurrently. These results indicate that the N170 component is modulated by the observer's identification level of Chinese characters, and that identifiableChinese characters compete with faces during early visual processing.
 Dysfunction of cognitive control often leads to impulsive decision-making inclinical and healthy populations. Some research suggests that a generalizedcognitive control mechanism underlies the ability to modulate various types ofimpulsive behavior, while other evidence suggests different forms of impulsivity are dissociable, and rely on distinct neural circuitry. Past researchconsistently implicates several brain regions, such as the striatum and portions of the prefrontal cortex, in impulsive behavior. However the ventral and dorsalstriatum are distinct in regards to function and connectivity. Nascent evidencepoints to the importance of frontostriatal white matter connectivity inimpulsivity, yet it remains unclear whether particular tracts relate to differentcontrol behaviors. Here we used probabilistic tractography of diffusion imagingdata to relate ventral and dorsal frontostriatal connectivity to reward and motorimpulsivity measures. We found a double dissociation such that individualdifferences in white matter connectivity between the ventral striatum and theventromedial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was associated with reward impulsivity, as measured by delay discounting, whereas connectivitybetween dorsal striatum and supplementary motor area was associated with motorimpulsivity, but not vice versa. Our findings suggest that (a) structuralconnectivity can is associated with a large amount of behavioral variation; (b)different types of impulsivity are driven by dissociable frontostriatal neuralcircuitry.
 Seeing or imagining others in pain may activate both the sensory and affectivecomponents of the neural network (pain matrix) that is activated during thepersonal experience of pain. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), provedadept at highlighting the sensorimotor side of empathy for pain in studies where mere observation of needles penetrating body parts of a human model brought abouta clear corticospinal motor inhibition. By using TMS, we investigated whetherinferring the sensory properties of the pain of a model influenced thesomatomotor system of an onlooker. Moreover, we tested the possiblelateralization of the motor substrates underlying this reading process. Werecorded motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) to left and right motor cortexstimulation during the observation of "flesh and bone" painful stimulations ofright and left hands respectively. We found a significant reduction of onlookers'MEPs amplitudes specific to the muscle penetrated in the model. Subjectiveinferences about localization and intensity of the observed pain were associated with specific patterns of motor modulation with larger inhibitory effectsfollowing stimulation of the left motor cortex. Thus, results indicate that themental simulation of the sensory qualities of others' pain may be lateralized to the left hemisphere.
 Experimental evidence suggests an impairment in emotion perception in numerouspsychiatric disorders. The results to date are primarily based on research using static displays of emotional facial expressions. However, our natural environmentis dynamic and multimodal, comprising input from various communication channelssuch as facial expressions, emotional prosody, and emotional semantics, to namebut a few. Thus, one critical open question is whether alterations in emotionperception in psychiatric populations are confirmed when testing patients indynamic and multimodal naturalistic settings. Furthermore, the impact taskdemands may exert on results also needs to be reconsidered. Focusing onschizophrenia and depression, we review evidence on how emotions are perceivedfrom faces and voices in these disorders and examine how experimental taskdemands, stimulus dynamics, and modality may affect study results.
 Research over the last several decades has shown that the health of the body isintimately tied to the strength of our social connections, but why? This article reviews evidence from affective and social neuroscience suggesting that, because of the importance of social ties for mammalian survival, threats to socialconnection are processed by some of the same neural regions that process basicthreats to survival and consequently trigger physiological threat responses that have negative health implications. Likewise, social support is processed by some of the same neural regions that process safety or protection from basic threatsand inhibit these same health-relevant physiological threat responses.
 As a social species, humans have a fundamental need to belong that encouragesbehaviors consistent with being a good group member. Being a good group memberrequires the capacity for self-regulation, which allows people to alter orinhibit behaviors that would place them at risk for group exclusion.Self-regulation requires four psychological components. First, people need to be aware of their behavior so as to gauge it against societal norms. Second, people need to understand how others are reacting to their behavior so as to predict howothers will respond to them. This necessitates a third mechanism, which detectsthreat, especially in complex social situations. Finally, there needs to be amechanism for resolving discrepancies between self-knowledge and socialexpectations or norms, thereby motivating behavior to resolve any conflict thatexists. This article reviews recent social neuroscience research on thepsychological components that support the human capacity for self-regulation.
 Enactive approaches foreground the role of interpersonal interaction inexplanations of social understanding. This motivates, in combination with arecent interest in neuroscientific studies involving actual interactions, thequestion of how interactive processes relate to neural mechanisms involved insocial understanding. We introduce the Interactive Brain Hypothesis (IBH) inorder to help map the spectrum of possible relations between social interactionand neural processes. The hypothesis states that interactive experience andskills play enabling roles in both the development and current function of socialbrain mechanisms, even in cases where social understanding happens in the absenceof immediate interaction. We examine the plausibility of this hypothesis against developmental and neurobiological evidence and contrast it with the widespreadassumption that mindreading is crucial to all social cognition. We describe theelements of social interaction that bear most directly on this hypothesis anddiscuss the empirical possibilities open to social neuroscience. We propose that the link between coordination dynamics and social understanding can be bestgrasped by studying transitions between states of coordination. These transitionsform part of the self-organization of interaction processes that characterize thedynamics of social engagement. The patterns and synergies of thisself-organization help explain how individuals understand each other. Variouspossibilities for role-taking emerge during interaction, determining a spectrumof participation. This view contrasts sharply with the observational stance that has guided research in social neuroscience until recently. We also introduce the concept of readiness to interact to describe the practices and dispositions that are summoned in situations of social significance (even if not interactive). Thislatter idea links interactive factors to more classical observational scenarios.
 Numerous studies explore consumer perception of brands in a more or less passive way. This may still be representative for many situations or decisions we makeeach day. Nevertheless, sometimes we often actively search for and useinformation to make informed and reasoned choices, thus implying a rational andthinking consumer. Researchers suggested describing this distinction as lowrelative to high involvement consumer behavior. Although the involvement concept has been widely used to explain consumer behavior, behavioral and neuralcorrelates of this concept are poorly understood. The current study aims todescribe a behavioral measure that is associated with high involvement, thelength of search behavior. A second aim of this study was to explore brainactivations associated with involvement by employing functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI). We presented participants information cues fordifferent products and told them that they had to answer questions with respectto these products at the end of the experiment. Participants were free to stopthe information search if they think they gathered enough information or tocontinue with collecting information. Behavioral results confirmed our hypothesisof a relationship between searching behavior and personal involvement bydemonstrating that the length of search correlated significantly with the degree of personal involvement of the participants. fMRI data revealed that personalinvolvement was associated with activation in BA44. Since this brain region isknown to be involved in semantic memory, the results of this pilot study suggest that high involvement consumer behavior may be linked to cognitive load andattention towards a product.
 Autism and Asperger syndrome are diagnostic entities in a family ofneurodevelopmental disorders disrupting fundamental processes of socialization,communication and learning, collectively known as pervasive developmentaldisorders. This group of conditions is among the most common developmentaldisorders, affecting 1 in every 200 or so individuals. They are also the moststrongly genetically related among developmental disorders, with recurrence riskswithin sibships of the order of 2 to 15% if a broader definition of affectedness is adopted. Their early onset, symptom profile, and chronicity implicatefundamental biological mechanisms involved in social adaptation. Advances intheir understanding are leading to a new social neuroscience perspective ofnormative socialization processes and specific disruptions thereof. Theseprocesses may lead to the emergence of the highly heterogeneous phenotypesassociated with autism, the paradigmatic pervasive developmental disorder, andits variants. This overview focuses on the history, nosology, and the clinicaland associated features of the two most well-known pervasive developmentaldisorders - autism and Asperger syndrome.
 We explore the neural underpinnings of gender differences in cooperation andtheir modulation by intensive media watching. We compared cooperative decisionsand electroencephalograph data between genders from who participated in repeated rounds of the public goods game (PGG) and investigated within groups changes thatoccurred after watching a TV program known as "investigative reporting" thatdenounces unfair advantages taken by free-riders against the public. Women tendedto be more cooperative than men during early rounds of PGG, mostly because theyreact differently to the defection of others; women also had greater beta andgamma band activity in regions estimated to be associated with social cognition. These gender differences disappeared after participants watched the TV programs: women were more likely to choose free-riding in response to the defection ofothers that elicits significant increases in gamma band activities that wereestimated to be right insula. Greater activity in social cognition leads women tomake decisions considering the motives of others, while men tend to make adecision by complying with the social norm. Watching the investigative TV reportsproduced a greater negative emotion to the defection and led women, in a similar manner as men, to opt for a "tit-for-tat" strategy.
 A growing body of behavioral studies has demonstrated that women's hemisphericspecialization varies as a function of their menstrual cycle, with hemisphericspecialization enhanced during their menstruation period. Our recent high-densityelectroencephalogram (EEG) study with lateralized emotional versus neutral words extended these behavioral results by showing that hemispheric specialization inmen, but not in women under birth-control, depends upon specific EEG restingbrain states at stimulus arrival, suggesting that hemispheric specialization may be pre-determined at the moment of the stimulus onset. To investigate whether EEGbrain resting state for hemispheric specialization could vary as a function ofthe menstrual phase, we tested 12 right-handed healthy women over differentphases of their menstrual cycle combining high-density EEG recordings and thesame lateralized lexical decision paradigm with emotional versus neutral words.Results showed the presence of specific EEG resting brain states, associated withhemispheric specialization for emotional words, at the moment of the stimulusonset during the menstruation period only. These results suggest that thepre-stimulus EEG pattern influencing hemispheric specialization is modulated bythe hormonal state.
 Social neuroscience studies the neurobiological underpinnings of people makingsense of people. Due to both conceptual and methodological constraints, themajority of studies in this field of research, however, has employed experimentalparadigms that focus on social cognition from an observer's rather than from aninteractor's point of view (offline vs. online social cognition). This calls for an increased effort to systematically investigate the neural bases ofparticipation in real-time social interaction. In light of the ontogeneticprimacy of social interaction over observation and the idea that neural networks established during social interaction may be "re-used" during observation, other important objectives of the field will be to relate new findings into the neural bases of social interaction to previous work investigating the neural bases ofsocial observation as well as to find ways to directly compare the two.
 This article proposes a framework for theory and research on risk-taking that is informed by developmental neuroscience. Two fundamental questions motivate thisreview. First, why does risk-taking increase between childhood and adolescence?Second, why does risk-taking decline between adolescence and adulthood?Risk-taking increases between childhood and adolescence as a result of changesaround the time of puberty in the brain's socio-emotional system leading toincreased reward-seeking, especially in the presence of peers, fueled mainly by adramatic remodeling of the brain's dopaminergic system. Risk-taking declinesbetween adolescence and adulthood because of changes in the brain's cognitivecontrol system - changes which improve individuals' capacity for self-regulation.These changes occur across adolescence and young adulthood and are seen instructural and functional changes within the prefrontal cortex and itsconnections to other brain regions. The differing timetables of these changesmake mid-adolescence a time of heightened vulnerability to risky and recklessbehavior.
 Converging evidence shows that the prefrontal cortex is involved in moraldecision-making. Individuals who have suffered injury to the ventromedialprefrontal cortex are more willing to endorse personal moral transgressions(e.g., make their decisions faster, and have attenuated sympathetic responses to those violations). We examined whether university students who have experienced amild head injury (MHI), and are asymptomatic, present with a similar pattern ofresponding to moral dilemmas. Students reporting a history of MHI responded more quickly when making moral choices and exhibited less reticence toward theendorsement of personal moral transgressions than their non-MHI counterparts. Ourresults are consistent with studies involving persons with more serious, andevident, neuronal injury, and emphasize the important relationship between headinjury and moral decision-making.
 Our own name, due to its high social relevance, is supposed to have a uniquestatus in our information processing. However, demonstrating this phenomenonempirically proves difficult as famous and unknown names, to which self-name isoften compared in the studies, may differ from self-name not only in terms of the'me vs. not-me' distinction, but also as regards their emotional content andfrequency of occurrence in everyday life. In this fMRI study, apart from famousand unknown names we used the names of the most important persons in oursubjects' lives. When compared to famous or unknown names recognition, self-name recognition was associated with robust activations in widely distributedbilateral network including fronto-temporal, limbic and subcortical structures,however, when compared to significant other's name, the activations were present specifically in the right inferior frontal gyrus. In addition, the significantother's name produced a similar pattern of activations to the one activated byself-name. These results suggest that the differences between own and other'sname processing may rather be quantitative than qualitative in nature.
 Recent advances in social neuroscience suggest a link between empathy and themirror neuron system (MNS). Impaired empathy is one of the core diagnosticfeatures of psychopathic personality disorder. In the present study, weinvestigated whether psychopathic personality traits in a non-psychiatric sample were related to MNS function. Healthy participants viewed short videos known toactivate the sensorimotor MNS for pain (a needle penetrating a human hand) while transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced motor evoked potentials (MEP)were recorded as a measure of motor cortex excitability. Individual psychopathic personality traits were assessed using the Psychopathic Personality Inventory(PPI) and correlated with the MEP findings. Consistent with previous data,observation of the painful stimulus was associated with a significant reductionin the amplitude of the TMS-induced MEP. Interestingly, the level ofcorticospinal excitability modulation was positively correlated with individualscores on the coldheartedness subscale of the PPI, such that individuals with thegreatest MEP reduction were the ones scoring highest on the coldheartednessmeasure. These data suggest the existence of a functional link between 'motorempathy' and psychopathy.
 Some neural properties of "motor resonance"--the subliminal activation of themotor system when observing actions performed by others--are investigated inhumans. Two actions performed with the right hand are observed by experimentalsubjects: a finalized (transitive) action (reaching for and grasping a ball) and an intransitive action (cyclic up-and-down oscillation of the hand), while theH-reflex and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation techniques are utilized to testthe excitability of the observer's motor pathways to hand and forearm muscles(first dorsal interosseus, flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor carpiradialis). Results indicate that motor resonance: (1) is mainly mediated by theprimary motor cortex; (2) involves the same forearm muscles as used in theexecution of the observed movement; (3) is also recorded in the homologousmuscles of the arm contralateral to the one observed; and (4) is evoked by bothtransitive and intransitive movements of the human hand, but not by similarmovements of inanimate objects. The similarities and discrepancies between theresonant response in humans and the properties of monkey "mirror neurons" arediscussed.
 Recent evidence implicates the arginine vasopressin (AVP) system in complexneuropsychological disorders which are characterized by deficits in executivefunctioning (EF). Despite the genetic contribution to EF, little is currentlyknown about its molecular genetic basis. Drawing on research from socialneuroscience and the role of related physiological systems in psychopathology,the current study hypothesized that variability in the AVP receptor 1a gene(AVPR1A) would be associated with EF in an epidemiological sample of 323 normallydeveloping preschool-aged children. Using a family-based association design, the current study found that variability in the rs7298346 marker, located in the5'-flanking region, was significantly related to a composite measure of EF in4-year-old children after controlling for a variety of covariates and children's theory of mind. The converse association between AVPR1A and theory of mind (aftercontrolling for EF) was not significant, suggesting a level of specificity inthis relationship. The results are discussed in terms of the difficulties facedby genetic association studies in teasing apart the behavioral phenotypes thatcharacterize complex psychological diseases and the involvement of multiplephysiological systems in human behavior.
 While empathy has been widely studied in philosophical and psychologicalliteratures, recent advances in social neuroscience have shed light on the neuralcorrelates of this complex interpersonal phenomenon. In this review, we providean overview of brain imaging studies that have investigated the neural substratesof human empathy. Based on existing models of the functional architecture ofempathy, we review evidence of the neural underpinnings of each main component,as well as their development from infancy. Although early precursors of affectivesharing and self-other distinction appear to be present from birth, recentfindings also suggest that even higher-order components of empathy such asperspective-taking and emotion regulation demonstrate signs of development duringinfancy. This merging of developmental and social neuroscience literature thussupports the view that ontogenic development of empathy is rooted in earlyinfancy, well before the emergence of verbal abilities. With age, the refinement of top-down mechanisms may foster more appropriate empathic responses, thuspromoting greater altruistic motivation and prosocial behaviors.
 Our prior research showed that faces and bodies activate overlapping regions ofthe ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOTC). However, faces and bodies werenonetheless discriminable in these same overlapping regions when their spatialpatterns of activity were classified using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA).Here we investigated whether these spatial patterns and their time courses wereinfluenced by different categorization tasks. Participants viewed pictures offaces or headless bodies depicting a happy or fearful emotion. In one task, they categorized the picture as a face or a body regardless of emotion. In the othertask, they categorized the emotion regardless of whether it was depicted by aface or body. Using a classifier trained on independent data, we found higherface-body classification accuracy for the emotion categorization task. Theclassifier was applied to each post-stimulus time-point to characterize thetemporal course of classification. Accuracy initially rose equivalently abovechance for both tasks, but then increased over a longer duration whenparticipants categorized emotions. Thus, the temporal course of patterndifferences between faces and bodies in VOTC was modulated by the behavioral goalof the observer, suggesting the top-down modulatory effect of task context on thecategory-selectivity activity in the VOTC.
 The bond between a parent and an infant often appears to form effortlessly andintuitively, and this relationship is fundamental to infant survival anddevelopment. Parenting is considered to depend on specific brain networks thatare largely conserved across species and in place even before parenthood. Effortsto understand the neural basis of parenting in humans have focused on theoverlapping networks implicated in reward and social cognition, within which the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is considered to be a crucial hub. This reviewexamines emerging evidence that the OFC may be engaged in several phases ofparent-infant interactions, from early, privileged orienting to infant cues, toongoing monitoring of interactions and subsequent learning. Specifically, wereview evidence suggesting that the OFC rapidly responds to a range of infantcommunicative cues, such as faces and voices, supporting their efficientprocessing. Crucially, this early orienting response may be fundamental insupporting adults to respond rapidly and appropriately to infant needs. Wesuggest a number of avenues for future research, including investigating neuralactivity in disrupted parenting, exploring multimodal cues, and consideration of neuroendocrine involvement in responsivity to infant cues. An increasedunderstanding of the brain basis of caregiving will provide insight into ourgreatest challenge: parenting our young.
 Fathering plays an important role in infants' socioemotional and cognitivedevelopment. Previous studies have identified brain regions that are importantfor parenting behavior in human mothers. However, the neural basis of parentingin human fathers is largely unexplored. In the current longitudinal study, weinvestigated structural changes in fathers' brains during the first 4 monthspostpartum using voxel-based morphometry analysis. Biological fathers (n = 16)with full-term, healthy infants were scanned at 2-4 weeks postpartum (time 1) andat 12-16 weeks postpartum (time 2). Fathers exhibited increase in gray matter(GM) volume in several neural regions involved in parental motivation, including the hypothalamus, amygdala, striatum, and lateral prefrontal cortex. On the otherhand, fathers exhibited decreases in GM volume in the orbitofrontal cortex,posterior cingulate cortex, and insula. The findings provide evidence for neural plasticity in fathers' brains. We also discuss the distinct patterns ofassociations among neural changes, postpartum mood symptoms, and parentingbehaviors among fathers.
 Power is thought to increase discrimination toward subordinate groups, yet itseffect on different forms of implicit bias remains unclear. We tested whetherpower enhances implicit racial stereotyping, in addition to implicit prejudice(i.e., evaluative associations), and examined the effect of power on theautomatic processing of faces during implicit tasks. Study 1 showed thatmanipulated high power increased both forms of implicit bias, relative to lowpower. Using a neural index of visual face processing (the N170 component of the ERP), Study 2 revealed that power affected the encoding of White ingroup vs.Black outgroup faces. Whereas high power increased the relative processing ofoutgroup faces during evaluative judgments in the prejudice task, it decreasedthe relative processing of outgroup faces during stereotype trait judgments. Anindirect effect of power on implicit prejudice through enhanced processing ofoutgroup versus ingroup faces suggested a potential link between face processing and implicit bias. Together, these findings demonstrate that power can affectimplicit prejudice and stereotyping as well as early processing of racial ingroupand outgroup faces.
 Although it has been shown that adults with attention-deficit hyperactivitydisorder (ADHD) have impaired social cognition, no previous study has reportedthe brain correlates of face valence processing. This study looked forbehavioral, neuropsychological, and electrophysiological markers of emotionprocessing for faces (N170) in adult ADHD compared to controls matched by age,gender, educational level, and handedness. We designed an event-related potential(ERP) study based on a dual valence task (DVT), in which faces and words werepresented to test the effects of stimulus type (faces, words, or face-wordstimuli) and valence (positive versus negative). Individual signatures ofcognitive functioning in participants with ADHD and controls were assessed with acomprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, including executive functioning (EF)and theory of mind (ToM). Compared to controls, the adult ADHD group showeddeficits in N170 emotion modulation for facial stimuli. These N170 impairmentswere observed in the absence of any deficit in facial structural processing,suggesting a specific ADHD impairment in early facial emotion modulation. Thecortical current density mapping of N170 yielded a main neural source of N170 at posterior section of fusiform gyrus (maximum at left hemisphere for words andright hemisphere for faces and simultaneous stimuli). Neural generators of N170(fusiform gyrus) were reduced in ADHD. In those patients, N170 emotion processingwas associated with performance on an emotional inference ToM task, and N170 fromsimultaneous stimuli was associated with EF, especially working memory. This isthe first report to reveal an adult ADHD-specific impairment in the corticalmodulation of emotion for faces and an association between N170 cortical measuresand ToM and EF.
 The neuroscience of decision making is a rapidly evolving multidisciplinaryresearch area that employs neuroscientific techniques to explain variousparameters associated with decision making behavior. In this chapter, weemphasize the role of multiple disciplines such as psychology, economics,neuroscience, and computational approaches in understanding the phenomenon ofdecision making. Further, we present a theoretical approach that suggestsunderstanding the building blocks of decision making as bottom-up processes andintegrate these with top-down modulatory factors. Relevant neurophysiological andneuroimaging findings that have used the building-block approach are reviewed. A unifying framework emphasizing multidisciplinary views would bring furtherinsights into the active research area of decision making. Pointing to futuredirections for research, we focus on the role of computational approaches in sucha unifying framework.
 Self-related stimuli such as the own name have been used to investigateself-awareness. The present study investigates a novel paradigm employingpersonal and possessive self-referential and non-self-referential pronouns (SRPs and NSRPs). Going beyond previous research, the robustness of the previouslydemonstrated self-reference effect was investigated for personal as well aspossessive SRPs under passive and active processing conditions usingevent-related brain potentials (ERPs) as outcome measures. ERPs were recordedfrom 33 healthy participants during the presentation of SRPs "ich" and "mein"(German for "I"/"my") and NSRPs "er" and "sein" ("he"/"his"). Additionally, therole of the second person perspective (2PP) pronouns "du" and "dein"("you"/"your") was explored. Stimuli were presented in a rapid serial visualpresentation (RSVP) design at frequencies of 2.5 and 1 Hz including a passivereading and two active counting instructions. The results demonstrate that SRPswere spontaneously processed preferentially compared to NSRPs during an initialprocessing stage. SRPs moreover specifically benefitted from allocation ofattention during later processing stages. These results suggest that processesduring which a stimulus is related to oneself or others take place very early.Differences in temporal processing of personal and possessive pronouns were notfound.
 Social cognitive skills are indispensable for successful communication withothers. Substantial research has determined deficits in these abilities inpatients with mental disorders. In neurobiological development and continuinginto adulthood, cross-cultural differences in social cognition have beendemonstrated. Moreover, symptomatic patterns in mental disorders may varyaccording to the cultural background of an individual. Cross-cultural studies canthus help in understanding underlying (biological) mechanisms and factors thatinfluence behavior in health and disease. In addition, studies that apply novelparadigms assessing the impact of culture on cognition may benefit and advanceneuroscience research. In this review, the authors give an overview ofcross-cultural research in the field of social cognition in health and in mental disorders and provide an outlook on future research directions, taking aneuroscience perspective.
 Oxytocin has repeatedly been shown to influence human behavior in socialcontexts; also, a relationship between oxytocin and the pathophysiology of autismspectrum disorder (ASD) has been suggested. In the present study, we investigatedsingle-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the oxytocin gene (OXT) and the genesfor single-minded 1 (SIM1), aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator 2(ARNT2) and cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) in a population of 1771 childrenfrom the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS). Statistical analyses were performed to investigate any association between SNPs and autistic-liketraits (ALTs), measured through ASD scores in the Autism-Tics, ADHD and otherCo-morbidities inventory. Firstly, we found a statistically significantassociation between the SIM1 SNP rs3734354 (Pro352Thr) and scores for languageimpairment (p = .0004), but due to low statistical power this should beinterpreted cautiously. Furthermore, nominal associations were found between ASD scores and SNPs in OXT, ARNT2 and CD38. In summary, the present study lendssupport to the hypothesis that oxytocin and oxytocin neuron development may have an influence on the development of ALTs and suggests a new candidate gene in the search for the pathophysiology of ASD.
 Mere familiarization with a stimulus increases liking for it or similar stimuli("mere exposure" effects) as well as perceptual fluency, indexed by the speed andaccuracy of categorizing it or similar stimuli ("priming" effects). Candidatemechanisms proposed to explain mere exposure effects include both increasedpositive affect associated with greater perceptual fluency, and reduced negative affect associated with diminished apprehensiveness of novel stimuli. Althoughthese two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, it is difficult for behavioralmeasures to disentangle them, since increased liking or other indices of greater positive affect toward exposed stimuli could result from increases in positivefeelings or decreases in negative feelings or both. The present study sought toclarify this issue by building on research showing a dissociation at the neurallevel in which the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (LOFC) is activated more bynegatively valenced than by neutral or positively valenced stimuli, with thereverse effect for medial orbitofrontal cortex (MOFC). Supporting the reducedapprehensiveness hypothesis, we found lower LOFC activation to familiarized facesand objects (repetition suppression). We did not find evidence to support thepositive affect hypothesis in increased activation to familiarized stimuli inMOFC or in other parts of the reward circuit that respond more to positivelyvalenced stimuli (repetition enhancement), although enhancement effects wereshown in some regions.
 The current study measured adults' P350 and N170 ERPs while they interacted with a character in a virtual reality paradigm. Some participants believed thecharacter was controlled by a human ("avatar" condition, n = 19); others believedit was controlled by a computer program ("agent" condition, n = 19). In eachtrial, participants initiated joint attention in order to direct the character's gaze toward a target. In 50% of trials, the character gazed toward the target(congruent responses), and in 50% of trials the character gazed to a differentlocation (incongruent response). In the avatar condition, the character'sincongruent gaze responses generated significantly larger P350 peaks atcentro-parietal sites than congruent gaze responses. In the agent condition, the P350 effect was strikingly absent. Left occipitotemporal N170 responses weresignificantly smaller in the agent condition compared to the avatar condition forboth congruent and incongruent gaze shifts. These data suggest that beliefs abouthuman agency may recruit mechanisms that discriminate the social outcome of agaze shift after approximately 350 ms, and that these mechanisms may modulate theearly perceptual processing of gaze. These findings also suggest that theecologically valid measurement of social cognition may depend upon paradigms thatsimulate genuine social interactions.
 We present a neural network implementation of central components of the iterativereprocessing (IR) model. The IR model argues that the evaluation of socialstimuli (attitudes, stereotypes) is the result of the IR of stimuli in ahierarchy of neural systems: The evaluation of social stimuli develops andchanges over processing. The network has a multilevel, bidirectional feedbackevaluation system that integrates initial perceptual processing and laterdeveloping semantic processing. The network processes stimuli (e.g., anindividual's appearance) over repeated iterations, with increasingly higherlevels of semantic processing over time. As a result, the network's evaluationsof stimuli evolve. We discuss the implications of the network for a number ofdifferent issues involved in attitudes and social evaluation. The success of the network supports the IR model framework and provides new insights into attitudetheory.
 Partly due to the failure of anthropology to productively engage the fields ofpsychology and neuroscience, investigations in cultural neuroscience haveoccurred largely without the active involvement of anthropologists oranthropological theory. Dramatic advances in the tools and findings of socialneuroscience have emerged in parallel with significant advances in anthropologythat connect social and political-economic processes with fine-graineddescriptions of individual experience and behavior. We describe four domains ofinquiry that follow from these recent developments, and provide suggestions forintersections between anthropological tools - such as social theory, ethnography,and quantitative modeling of cultural models - and cultural neuroscience. Thesedomains are: the sociocultural construction of emotion, status and dominance, theembodiment of social information, and the dual social and biological nature ofritual. Anthropology can help locate unique or interesting populations andphenomena for cultural neuroscience research. Anthropological tools can also help"drill down" to investigate key socialization processes accountable forcross-group differences. Furthermore, anthropological research points atmeaningful underlying complexity in assumed relationships between social forcesand biological outcomes. Finally, ethnographic knowledge of cultural content can aid with the development of ecologically relevant stimuli for use in experimentalprotocols.
 Numerous cortical regions respond to aspects of the human form and its actions.What is the contribution of the extrastriate body area (EBA) to this network? In particular, is the EBA involved in constructing a dynamic representation ofobserved actions? We scanned 16 participants with fMRI while they viewed twokinds of stimulus sequences. In the coherent condition, static frames from amovie of a single, intransitive whole-body action were presented in the correctorder. In the incoherent condition, a series of frames from multiple actions(involving one actor) were presented. ROI analyses showed that the EBA, unlikearea MT + and the posterior superior temporal sulcus, responded more to theincoherent than to the coherent conditions. Whole brain analyses revealedincreased activation to the coherent sequences in parietal and frontal regionsthat have been implicated in the observation and control of movement. We suggest that the EBA response adapts when succeeding images depict relatively similarpostures (coherent condition) compared to relatively different postures(incoherent condition). We propose that the EBA plays a unique role in theperception of action, by representing the static structure, rather than dynamicaspects, of the human form.
 Successful human social interaction depends on our capacity to understand otherpeople's mental states and to anticipate how they will react to our actions.Despite its importance to the human condition, the exact mechanisms underlyingour ability to understand another's actions, feelings, and thoughts are still amatter of conjecture. Here, we consider this problem from philosophical,psychological, and neuroscientific perspectives. In a critical review, wedemonstrate that attempts to draw parallels across these complementarydisciplines is premature: The second-person perspective does not map directly to Interaction or Simulation theories, online social cognition, or shared neuralnetwork accounts underlying action observation or empathy. Nor does thethird-person perspective map onto Theory-Theory (TT), offline social cognition,or the neural networks that support Theory of Mind (ToM). Moreover, we argue thatimportant qualities of social interaction emerge through the reciprocal interplayof two independent agents whose unpredictable behavior requires that models oftheir partner's internal state be continually updated. This analysis drawsattention to the need for paradigms in social neuroscience that allow twoindividuals to interact in a spontaneous and natural manner and to adapt theirbehavior and cognitions in a response contingent fashion due to the inherentunpredictability in another person's behavior. Even if such paradigms wereimplemented, it is possible that the specific neural correlates supporting suchreciprocal interaction would not reflect computation unique to social interactionbut rather the use of basic cognitive and emotional processes combined in aunique manner. Finally, we argue that given the crucial role of socialinteraction in human evolution, ontogeny, and every-day social life, a moretheoretically and methodologically nuanced approach to the study of real socialinteraction will nevertheless help the field of social cognition to evolve.
 Values are motivational constructs that determine what is important to us andwhich goals we choose to pursue. Cross-cultural research suggests that thestructure of the human value system is universal, but people and cultures differ in terms of relative value priorities. Differences in psychological valuehierarchies can be parsimoniously described using the orthogonal dimensionsself-interest and openness to change. Using fMRI, we investigated whetherindividual differences in these universal dimensions are reflected in basicneural reward mechanisms during a donation task and a GO/NOGO-task. Individualswith high self-interest value sacrificed less money for charitable donations and showed higher activation of the ventral striatum when receiving monetary rewards.Furthermore, individuals with high openness to change value showed a greatersensitivity of the dorsal striatum when trying to inhibit habitual prepotentresponses. Our findings suggest that context-dependent neural reward sensitivity biases reflect (and may even determine) differences in individual valuehierarchies and underlie the effects of values on decisions and behaviors.
 Although motivation is a well-established field of study in its own right, andhas been fruitfully studied in connection with attribution theory and beliefformation under the heading of "motivated thinking," its powerful and pervasiveinfluence on specifically explanatory processes is less well explored. Where one has a strong motivation to understand some event correctly, one is therebymotivated to adhere as best one can to normative or "epistemic" criteria forcorrect or accurate explanation, even if one does not consciously formulate orapply such criteria. By contrast, many of our motivations to explain introducebias into the processes involved in generating, evaluating, or givingexplanations. Non-epistemic explanatory motivations, or following Kunda's usage, "directional" motivations, include self-justification, resolution of cognitivedissonance, deliberate deception, teaching, and many more. Some of thesemotivations lead to the relaxation or violation of epistemic norms; othersenhance epistemic motivation, so that one engages in more careful and thoroughgenerational and evaluative processes. We propose that "real life" explanatoryprocesses are often constrained by multiple goals, epistemic and directional,where these goals may mutually reinforce one another or may conflict, and whereour explanations emerge as a matter of weighing and satisfying those goals. Wereview emerging evidence from psychology and neuroscience to support thisframework and to elucidate the central role of motivation in human thought andexplanation.
 Decades of research have demonstrated strong links between social ties andhealth. Although considerable evidence has shown that social support canattenuate downstream physiological stress responses that are relevant to health, the neurocognitive mechanisms that translate perceptions of social ties intoaltered physiological responses are still not fully understood. This reviewintegrates research from social and affective neuroscience to illuminate some of the neural mechanisms involved in social support processes, which may further ourunderstanding of the ways in which social support influences health. This review focuses on two types of social support that have been shown to relate to health: receiving and giving social support. As the neural basis of receiving support,this article reviews the hypothesis that receiving support may benefit healththrough the activation of neural regions that respond to safety and inhibitthreat-related neural and physiological responding. This article will then reviewneuroimaging studies in which participants were primed with or received supportduring a negative experience as well as studies in which self-reports ofperceived support were correlated with neural responses to a negative experience.As the neural basis of giving support, this article reviews the hypothesis thatneural regions involved in maternal caregiving behavior may be critical for thehealth benefits of support-giving through the inhibition of threat-related neuraland physiological responding. Neuroimaging studies in which participants providedsupport to others or engaged in other related forms of prosocial behavior willthen be reviewed. Implications of these findings for furthering our understandingof the relationships between social support and health are discussed.
 The psychological construct of empathy refers to an intersubjective inductionprocess by which positive and negative emotions are shared, without losing sight of whose feelings belong to whom. Empathy can lead to personal distress or toempathic concern (sympathy). The goal of this paper is to address the underlying cognitive processes and their neural underpinnings that constitute empathy withina developmental neuroscience perspective. In addition, we focus on how theseprocesses go awry in developmental disorders marked by impairments in socialcognition, such as autism spectrum disorder, and conduct disorder. We argue that empathy involves both bottom-up and top-down information processing, underpinned by specific and interacting neural systems. We discuss data from developmentalpsychology as well as cognitive neuroscience in support of such a model, andhighlight the impact of neural dysfunctions on social cognitive developmentalbehavior. Altogether, bridging developmental science and cognitive neurosciencehelps approach a more complete understanding of social cognition. Synthesizingthese two domains also contributes to a better characterization of developmental psychopathologies that impacts the development of effective treatment strategies.
 Every day we encounter new people, interact with them, and form personimpressions based on quick and automatic inferences from minimal contextualinformation. Previous studies have identified an extensive network of brain areasinvolved in familiar face recognition, but there is little evidence to dateconcerning the neural bases of negative vs. positive person impressions. In thepresent study, participants were repeatedly exposed to 16 unfamiliar faceidentities within a pseudo-interactive game context to generate a perception ofeither "friends" or "foes". Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was thenperformed during an old/new memory task to assess any difference in brainresponses to these now familiar face identities, relative to unfamiliar faces.Importantly, whereas facial expressions were always emotional (either smiling or angry) during the encoding phase, they were always neutral during the memorytask. Our results reveal that several brain regions involved in familiar facerecognition, including fusiform cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, and amygdala, plus additional areas involved in motivational control such as caudate andanterior cingulate cortex, were differentially modulated as a function of aprevious encounter, and generally more activated when faces were perceived as"foes" rather than "friends". These findings underscore that a key dimension ofsocial judgments, based on past impressions of who may be supportive or hostile, may lead to long-lasting effects on memory for faces and thus influence affectivereactions to people during a subsequent encounter even in a different (neutral)context.
 Intranasal oxytocin (OT) can modulate social-emotional functioning and relatedbrain activity in humans. Consequently, OT has been discussed as a potentialtreatment for psychiatric disorders involving social behavioral deficits.However, OT effects are often heterogeneous across individuals. Here we exploreindividual differences in OT effects on the neural response to social cooperationas a function of the rs53576 polymorphism of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR).Previously, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in whichhealthy men and women were randomized to treatment with intranasal OT or placebo.Afterwards, they were imaged with functional magnetic resonance imaging whileplaying an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game with same-sex partners. Within theleft ventral caudate nucleus, intranasal OT treatment increased activation toreciprocated cooperation in men, but tended to decrease activation in women.Here, we show that these sex differences in OT effects are specific toindividuals with the rs53576 GG genotype, and are not found for other genotypes(rs53576 AA/AG). Thus, OT may increase the reward or salience of positive social interactions for male GG homozygotes, while decreasing those processes for femaleGG homozygotes. These results suggest that rs53576 genotype is an importantvariable to consider in future investigations of the clinical efficacy ofintranasal OT treatment.
 For future interplanetary manned spaceflight, mental issues, as well asphysiological problems, must inevitably be considered and solved. Mars500 is ahigh-fidelity ground simulation experiment that involved 520 days of confinedisolation for six multinational crewmembers. This experiment provided a goodopportunity to perform psycho-physiological and psycho-social researches on such missions. To investigate emotional responses and psychological adaptation overlong-term confinement, the International Affective Pictures System (IAPS) wasselected as the visual emotional stimuli in this study. Additional data collectedand analyzed included the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire and thelevels of four types of plasma hormones: cortisol, 5-hydroxy tryptamine,dopamine, and norepinephrine. The results demonstrated an obvious bias on valencerating for unpleasant stimuli with time (p<0.05), and the correlation betweenpsychological and biochemical data was identified (p<0.05). Overall, we concludedthat the confined crew tended to assign positive ratings to negative pictureswith time, which might be driven by a defensive system. There was astage-changing pattern of psychological adaptation of the Mars500 crew, which is similar to the third-quarter phenomenon.
 Affective neuroscience has helped guide research and theory development injudgment and decision-making by revealing the role of emotional processes inchoice behavior, especially when risk is involved. Evidence is emerging thatqualitatively and quantitatively different processes may be involved in riskydecision-making for gains and losses. We start by reviewing behavioral work byKahneman and Tversky (1979) and others, which shows that risk-taking differs for potential gains and potential losses. We then turn to the literature in decision neuroscience to support the gain versus loss distinction. Relying in part on datafrom a new task that separates risky decision-making for gains and losses, wetest a neural model that assigns unique mechanisms for risky decision-makinginvolving potential losses. Included are studies using patients with lesions tobrain areas specified as important in the model and studies with healthyindividuals whose brains are scanned to reveal activation in these and otherareas during risky decision-making. In some cases, there is evidence that gainsand losses are processed in different regions of the brain, while in other cases the same region appears to process risk in a different manner for gains andlosses. At a more general level, we provide strong support for the notion thatdecisions involving risk-taking for gains and decisions involving risk-taking forlosses represent different psychological processes. At a deeper level, we presentmounting evidence that different neural structures play different roles inguiding risky choices in these different domains. Some structures aredifferentially activated by risky gains and risky losses while others responduniquely in one domain or the other. Taken together, these studies support aclear functional dissociation between risk-taking for gains and risk-taking forlosses, and further dissociation at the neural level.
 Using a technique for measuring brain activity simultaneously from two people,known as hyperscanning, we can calculate inter-brain neural effects that appearonly in interactions between individuals. Hyperscanning studies using fMRI areadvantageous in that they can precisely determine the region(s) involved ininter-brain effects. However, it is almost impossible to record inter-braineffects in daily life. By contrast, hyperscanning EEG studies have high temporal resolution and could be used to capture moment-to-moment interactions. Inaddition, EEG instrumentation is portable and easy to wear, offering theopportunity to record inter-brain effects during daily-life interactions.However, the disadvantage of this approach is that it is difficult to localizethe epicenter of the inter-brain effect. fNIRS has better temporal resolution andportability than fMRI, but has limited spatial resolution and a limited abilityto record deep brain structures. Future studies should employ hyperscanningEEG-fMRI, because this approach combines the high temporal resolution of EEG withthe high spatial resolution of fMRI. Hyperscanning EEG-fMRI allows us to useinter-brain effects as neuromarkers of the properties of social interactions indaily life. We also wish to emphasize the need to develop a mathematical modelexplaining how two brains can exhibit synchronized activity.
 Neuroanthropology is a new field of research that can make two distinctivecontributions to our understanding of the brain-culture nexus. The firstcontribution has to do with the question of how socially shared meanings andpractices are reflected in brain function and structure - the culture in thebrain problem. Neuroanthropology's second contribution relates to the neuralprocesses that generate socially shared meanings and practices - the brain inculture problem. Research in cultural neuroscience has focused on the firstquestion while research in social neuroscience has a bearing on the second. Aneuroanthropological perspective is vital to integrate these two most importantdimensions of the human condition. In this paper we review research from culturalanthropology, primatology, and developmental psychology, in addition to socialand cultural neuroscience, that deals with these two core neuroanthropologicalissues. Regarding the brain in culture problem, the review reveals thatrelational recoding is the basis of a host of cognitive functions that enable theformation of socially shared meanings and practices. The review also shows thatrelational recoding corresponds to the processing style characteristic of theprefrontal cortex (PFC). With respect to the culture in the brain problem, themost salient finding is the extent and breadth of the influence of culture on thebrain: literally all brain areas, cortical and subcortical, respond toregularities in the cultural stream of experience. Furthermore, culture not only shapes preexisting patterns of neural activity but it may also determine whether a pattern is at all present. In addition to influencing brain function culturealso changes the structure of the brain. The review finally indicates thatcultural regularities can modulate cognitive function both implicitly andexplicitly. Overall, the PFC can be regarded as the structure that establishesrelationships between things and events that are represented in the differentareas distributed across the brain. These areas become in this manner morereadily available for modulation or constitution by (cultural) experience.However, the PFC is the structure that stands first to be modified or constitutedby cultural experience as it is the structure that lays culture's foundations.
 Although consciousness can be brought to bear on both perceptual and internallygenerated information, little is known about how these different cognitive modes are coordinated. Here we show that between-participant variance in thoughtsunrelated to the task being performed (known as task unrelated thought, TUT) isassociated with longer response times (RT) when target presentation occurs duringperiods when baseline Pupil Diameter (PD) is increased. As behavioralinterference due to high baseline PD can reflect increased tonic activity in the norepinephrine system (NE), these results might implicate high tonic NE activity in the facilitation of TUTs. Based on these findings, it is hypothesised thathigh tonic mode NE leads to a generalised de-amplification of task relevantinformation that prioritses internally generated thought and insulates it fromthe potentially disruptive events taking place in the external environment.
 Emotions elicited by interpersonal versus non-interpersonal experiences havedifferent effects on neurobiological functioning in both animals and humans.However, the extent to which the brain circuits underlying interpersonal andnon-interpersonal emotions are distinct still remains unclear. The goal of ourstudy was to assess whether different neural circuits are implicated in theprocessing of arousal and valence of interpersonal versus non-interpersonalemotions. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants imaginedthemselves in emotion-eliciting interpersonal or non-interpersonal situations andthen rated the arousal and valence of emotions they experienced. We identified(1) separate neural circuits that are implicated in the arousal and valencedimensions of interpersonal versus non-interpersonal emotions, (2) circuits that are implicated in arousal and valence for both types of emotion, and (3) circuitsthat are responsive to the type of emotion, regardless of the valence or arousal level of the emotion. We found extensive recruitment of limbic (for arousal) and temporal-parietal (for valence) systems associated with processing ofspecifically interpersonal emotions compared to non-interpersonal ones. Theneural bases of interpersonal and non-interpersonal emotions may, therefore, belargely distinct.
 When acting and attending together, we take each other's perceptual andintentional relations to the environment into account. The present studyinvestigated whether people are also sensitive to a co-actor's attentionalrelation to jointly attended events. Two participants sat next to each other and performed a two-choice Navon task, responding to the identity of letters formedby identical (congruent) or different (incongruent) smaller letters while EEG wasrecorded. Crucially, participants either held the same focus of attention (e.g., both attending to local stimulus features) or different foci of attention (e.g., one attending to local and the other to global features). Results revealed asignificant slow-down of responses when participants focused on differentfeatures. Amplitudes of the occipital P1 and parietal occipital P3 decreased whenattentional foci differed. The amplitude of the fronto-central N2 increased when the other attended to local as compared to global features. These results suggestthat representations of a co-actor's task can include a specification of his orher focus of attention. Taking into account the other's different attentionalrelation to stimuli likely induces a conflict at the level of task selection,impairing early allocation of attention (P1) and enhancing the need to monitorresponse initiation (P3).
 This review provides an overview of the field of social neuroscience from aEuropean perspective and focuses mainly on outlining research topics whichoriginated in European laboratories. After a brief historical synopsis of theemergence of this young field, the most relevant findings related to theinvestigation of the neural networks underlying our capacity to understand theminds of others are summarized. More specifically, three routes of socialcognition are distinguished: (1) our capacity to mentalize, or to inferintentions and beliefs of others, (2) our capacity to mimic and understandother's motor actions, and (3) our capacity to empathize, or to share andunderstand the feelings of others. More recent studies focusing on socialemotions such as love, compassion, revenge or our sense of fairness will bediscussed linking the field of social neuroscience to the even younger field ofneuroeconomics, with the focus on the study of human social interactions usinggame theoretical paradigms. Finally, the use of a multi-method andmulti-disciplinary research approach combining genetic, pharmacological,computational and developmental aspects is advocated and future directions forthe study of interactive minds are discussed.
 Morality is a fundamental component of human cultures and has been defined asprescriptive norms regarding how people should treat one another, includingconcepts such as justice, fairness, and rights. Using fMRI, the current studyexamined the extent to which dispositions in justice sensitivity (i.e., howindividuals react to experiences of injustice and unfairness) predict behavioral ratings of praise and blame and how they modulate the online neural response and functional connectivity when participants evaluate morally laden (good and bad)everyday actions. Justice sensitivity did not impact the neuro-hemodynamicresponse in the action-observation network but instead influenced higher-ordercomputational nodes in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), rightdorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (rdlPFC, dmPFC) that processmental states understanding and maintain goal representations. Activity in these regions predicted praise and blame ratings. Further, the hemodynamic response in rTPJ showed a differentiation between good and bad actions 2 s before theresponse in rdlPFC. Evaluation of good actions was specifically associated withenhanced activity in dorsal striatum and increased the functional couplingbetween the rTPJ and the anterior cingulate cortex. Together, this study providesimportant knowledge in how individual differences in justice sensitivity impactneural computations that support psychological processes involved in moraljudgment and mental-state reasoning.
 The anterior portion of the inferior parietal cortex possesses comprehensiverepresentations of actions embedded in behavioural contexts. Mirror neurons,which respond to both self-executed and observed actions, exist in this brainregion in addition to those originally found in the premotor cortex. We foundthat parietal mirror neurons responded differentially to identical actionsembedded in different contexts. Another type of parietal mirror neuron representsan inverse and complementary property of responding equally to dissimilar actionsmade by itself and others for an identical purpose. Here, we propose a hypothesisthat these sets of inferior parietal neurons constitute a neural basis forencoding the semantic equivalence of various actions across different agents and contexts. The neurons have mirror neuron properties, and they encodedgeneralization of agents, differentiation of outcomes, and categorization ofactions that led to common functions. By integrating the activities of thesemirror neurons with various codings, we further suggest that in the ancestralprimates' brains, these various representations of meaningful action led to thegradual establishment of equivalence relations among the different types ofactions, by sharing common action semantics. Such differential codings of thecomponents of actions might represent precursors to the parts of protolanguage,such as gestural communication, which are shared among various members of asociety. Finally, we suggest that the inferior parietal cortex serves as aninterface between this action semantics system and other higher semantic systems,through common structures of action representation that mimic language syntax.
 The objective of this investigation was to examine the cognitive characteristics of individuals who demonstrate successful and unsuccessful self-regulation ofphysical activity behavior. In Study 1, participants articulated 1-weekintentions for physical activity and wore a triaxial accelerometer over thesubsequent 7 days. Among those who were motivated to increase their physicalactivity, those who were most and least successful were administered an IQ test. In Study 2, a second sample of participants completed the same protocol and asmaller subset of matched participants attended a functional imaging (fMRI)session. In Study 1, successful self-regulators (SSRs) scored significantlyhigher than unsuccessful self-regulators (USRs) on a test of general cognitiveability, and this difference could not be accounted for by favorability ofattitudes toward physical activity or conscientiousness. In Study 2, the IQeffect was replicated, with SSRs showing a full standard deviation advantage overUSRs. In the imaging protocol, USRs showed heavier recruitment of cognitiveresources relative to SSRs in the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortexduring performance of a Stroop task; SSRs showed heavier recruitment in the rightdorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
 Verbal social interaction plays an important role both in the etiology andtreatment of psychiatric disorders. However, the neural basis of socialinteraction has primarily been studied in the individual brain, neglecting theinter-individual perspective. Here, we show inter-individual neuronal coupling ofbrain activity during live verbal interaction, by investigating 11 pairs of good female friends who were instructed to speak about autobiographical life eventsduring simultaneous fMRI acquisition. The analysis revealed that the time course of neural activity in areas associated with speech production was coupled withthe time course of neural activity in the interlocutor's auditory cortex. Thisshows the feasibility of the new methodology, which may help elucidate basicreciprocal mechanisms of social interaction and the underpinnings of disorderedcommunication. In particular, it may serve to study the process of psychotherapy on a neuronal level.
 Social species create emergent organizations beyond the individual. Theseemergent structures evolved hand in hand with neural, hormonal, cellular, andgenetic mechanisms to support them because the consequent social behaviors helpedthese organisms survive, reproduce, and care for offspring sufficiently long thatthey too reproduced. Social neuroscience seeks to specify the neural, hormonal,cellular, and genetic mechanisms underlying social behavior, and in so doing tounderstand the associations and influences between social and biological levelsof organization. Success in the field, therefore, is not measured in terms of thecontributions to social psychology per se, but rather in terms of thespecification of the biological mechanisms underlying social interactions andbehavior-one of the major problems for the neurosciences to address in the 21stcentury.
 The false belief task commonly used in the study of theory of mind (ToM) requiresparticipants to select among competing responses and inhibit prepotent responses,giving rise to three possibilities: (1) the false belief tasks might require onlyexecutive function abilities and there may be no domain-specific component; (2)executive control might be necessary for the emergence of ToM in development but play no role in adult mental state inferences; and (3) executive control anddomain-specific ToM abilities might both be implicated. We used fMRI in healthyadults to dissociate these possibilities. We found that non-overlapping brainregions were implicated selectively in response selection and belief attribution,that belief attribution tasks recruit brain regions associated with responseselection as much as well-matched control tasks, and that regions associated withToM (e.g., the right temporo-parietal junction) were implicated only in thebelief attribution tasks. These results suggest that both domain-general anddomain-specific cognitive resources are involved in adult ToM.
 By its 20th anniversary, social neuroscience has witnessed an incredible rise in the number of studies demonstrating the effects of perceived social isolation(e.g., loneliness, ostracism), and inversely, the beneficial effects of socialbonding (e.g., love, desire, attachment) on social perception, cognition, andbehavior and on mental and physical health. The current review underscores theimportance of two factors in this literature: (1) where an individual falls alongthe continuum of isolation/bonding from feelings of rejection and neglect tofeelings of strong, stable, trusted social bonds, and (2) whether gauging anindividual's general feeling of social isolation/bonding or the specific feeling of isolation/bonding toward the person with whom the individual is interacting.Evidence shows that these factors are related to brain and cognition, includingembodied social cognition-a system integrating past self-related actions fromwhich simulation mechanisms can be used to access other people's minds andanticipate their actions. The neurophysiological mechanisms underlyingsensorimotor mapping between interacting individuals offers an empiricalopportunity to investigate the interpersonal forces that operate on individualsat a distance. This multilevel integrative approach provides a valuable tool for investigating the brain networks responsible for understanding acute and chronic social disorders.
 Research with violent offenders and delinquent adolescents suggests thatendogenous testosterone concentrations have the strongest positive correlationswith violence among men who have low concentrations of cortisol. The presentstudy tested the hypothesis that testosterone and cortisol would similarlyinteract to determine neural activation in regions supporting self-regulation in response to anger provocation. Nineteen healthy Asian male participants wereinsulted and asked to control their anger during functional magnetic resonanceimaging (fMRI). When cortisol levels were low, testosterone positively correlatedwith activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and thalamus, butnot when cortisol levels were high. During induced anger control, functionalconnectivity was increased between the amygdala and a top-down prefrontalcortical control network. Moreover, the amygdala-PFC connectivity was strongestamong those high in testosterone and low in cortisol. This research highlights a possible neural mechanism by which testosterone and cortisol may influence anger control.
 People give widely varying estimates for the amount of genetic overlap thatexists between humans. While some laypeople believe that humans are highlygenetically similar to one another, others believe that humans share very little genetic overlap. These studies examine how beliefs about genetic overlap affectneural and evaluative reactions to racially-ambiguous and biracial targets. InStudy 1, we found that lower genetic overlap estimates predicted a strongerneural avoidance response to biracial compared to monoracial targets. In Study 2,we found that lower genetic overlap estimates predicted longer response times to classify biracial (vs. monoracial) faces into racial categories. In Study 3, wemanipulated genetic overlap beliefs and found that participants in the lowoverlap condition explicitly rated biracial targets more negatively than those inthe high overlap condition. Taken together, these data suggest that geneticoverlap beliefs influence perceivers' processing fluency and evaluation ofbiracial and racially-ambiguous individuals.
 Perception of dispositions of others revealed by movement is an essentialingredient of adaptive daily-life social behavior. Brain imaging points toseveral brain regions involved in visual processing of social interactionrepresented by motion of geometric shapes. However, temporal interrelations amongthese regions remain unknown. Keeping in mind that successful visual socialperception depends on intact communication throughout the brain, we focus here onanalysis of the induced gamma neuromagnetic response to social interactionrevealed by motion. A peak of induced gamma activity of 62 Hz was found at 1 sfrom the stimulus onset over the right parieto-temporal junction. Two furtherenhancements in gamma response of lower frequency of 44 Hz occurred at 1.4 s overthe medial prefrontal and posterior temporal cortices in the right hemisphere.Subsequent boosts of 44 Hz were found at 1.6 s over the left temporal and rightposterior temporal cortices. For the first time, the findings identify thecortical network engaged in visual processing of social interaction revealed bymotion and help to better understand proper functioning of the social braincircuitry.
 Humans have the ability to reflect upon their perception, thoughts, and actions, known as metacognition (MC). The brain basis of MC is incompletely understood,and it is debated whether MC on different processes is subserved by common ordivergent networks. We combined behavioral phenotyping with multi-modalneuroimaging to investigate whether structural substrates of individualdifferences in MC on higher-order cognition (MC-C) are dissociable from thoseunderlying MC on perceptual accuracy (MC-P). Motivated by conceptual worksuggesting a link between MC and cognitive perspective taking, we furthermoretested for overlaps between MC substrates and mentalizing networks. In a largesample of healthy adults, individual differences in MC-C and MC-P did notcorrelate. MRI-based cortical thickness mapping revealed a structural basis ofthis independence, by showing that individual differences in MC-P related toright prefrontal cortical thickness, while MC-C scores correlated with measuresin lateral prefrontal, temporo-parietal, and posterior midline regions.Surface-based superficial white matter diffusivity analysis revealed substratesresembling those seen for cortical thickness, confirming the divergence of bothMC faculties using an independent imaging marker. Despite their specificity,substrates of MC-C and MC-P fell clearly within networks known to participate in mentalizing, confirmed by task-based fMRI in the same subjects, previousmeta-analytical findings, and ad-hoc Neurosynth-based meta-analyses. Ourintegrative multi-method approach indicates domain-specific substrates of MC;despite their divergence, these nevertheless likely rely on component processesmediated by circuits also involved in mentalizing.

 Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes survival and synapticplasticity in the human brain. The Val66Met polymorphism of the BDNF geneinterferes with intracellular trafficking, packaging, and regulated secretion of this neurotrophin. The human prefrontal cortex (PFC) shows lifelong neuroplastic adaption implicating the Val66Met BDNF polymorphism in the recovery ofhigher-order executive functions after traumatic brain injury (TBI). In thisstudy, we examined the effect of this BDNF polymorphism on the preservation ofgeneral intelligence following TBI. We genotyped a sample of male Vietnam combat veterans (n = 156) consisting of a frontal lobe lesion group with focalpenetrating head injuries for the Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Val/Met did notdiffer from Val/Val genotypes in general cognitive ability before TBI. However,we found substantial average differences between these groups in generalintelligence ( approximately half a standard deviation or 8 IQ points), verbalcomprehension (6 IQ points), perceptual organization (6 IQ points), workingmemory (8 IQ points), and processing speed (8 IQ points) after TBI. These resultssupport the conclusion that Val/Met genotypes preserve general cognitivefunctioning, whereas Val/Val genotypes are largely susceptible to TBI.
 First- and third-person experiences of bodily sensations, like pain and touch,recruit overlapping neural networks including sensorimotor, insular, and anteriorcingulate cortices. Here we illustrate the peculiar role of these structures incoding the sensory and affective qualities of the observed bodily sensations.Subsequently we show that such neural activity is critically influenced by arange of social, emotional, cognitive factors, and importantly byinter-individual differences in the separate components of empathic traits.Finally we suggest some fundamental issues that social neuroscience has toaddress for providing a comprehensive knowledge of the behavioral, functional andanatomical brain correlates of empathy.
 Guided by influential models of face processing, efforts have been expended touncover the neural substrates subserving the many facets of face perception.Extending this work, the present study used functional brain imaging (fMRI) toexplore the relationship between the operations supporting the explicitextraction of sex and gaze-related information from faces. The brain imaging datashowed the right superior temporal sulcus to be preferentially involved duringassessments of gaze direction and a region of the left fusiform gyrus to beinvolved during sex categorization. These results provide support for thedistributed face-processing model advanced by Haxby and colleagues (2000).
 Compared with other psychiatric disorders, diagnosis of factitious disorders israre, with identification largely dependent on the systematic collection ofrelevant information, including a detailed chronology and scrutiny of thepatient's medical record. Management of such disorders ideally requires ateam-based approach and close involvement of the primary care doctor. Asdeception is a key defining component of factitious disorders, diagnosis hasimportant implications for young children, particularly when identified in women and health-care workers. Malingering is considered to be rare in clinicalpractice, whereas simulation of symptoms, motivated by financial rewards, isregarded as more common in medicolegal settings. Although psychometricinvestigations (eg, symptom validity testing) can inform the detection of illnessdeception, such tests need support from converging evidence sources, includingdetailed interview assessments, medical notes, and relevant non-medicalinvestigations. A key challenge in any discussion of abnormal health-care-seekingbehaviour is the extent to which a person's reported symptoms are considered tobe a product of choice, or psychopathology beyond volitional control, or perhaps both. Clinical skills alone are not typically sufficient for diagnosis or todetect malingering. Medical education needs to provide doctors with theconceptual, developmental, and management frameworks to understand and deal with patients whose symptoms appear to be simulated. Central to the understanding offactitious disorders and malingering are the explanatory models and beliefs used to provide meaning for both patients and doctors. Future progress in managementwill benefit from an increased appreciation of the contribution of non-medicalfactors and a greater awareness of the conceptual and clinical findings fromsocial neuroscience, occupational health, and clinical psychology.
 Several studies have demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia showimpairments in social cognition and current evidence indicate that this deficitis associated with abnormal activity in specific brain regions. In addition tofunctional imaging studies, we believe that the identification of structuralcorrelates of social cognitive processes may help to better understand the neuralunderpinnings of these specific skills. The main objective of this study was toinvestigate the relationship between gray matter density and social cognitivedeficits in first episode of schizophrenia spectrum psychosis, using acomprehensive assessment that we previously demonstrated to be a highly sensitivemeasure of social cognitive deficits in this population. Thirty-eight patientswith a first episode of psychosis participated in this study, and the Four FactorTest of Social Intelligence was used as a measure of social cognition. Socialcognitive impairments in first episode psychosis were significantly correlatedwith reduced gray-matter density in the left middle frontal gyrus other regionswithin the mirror neuron system network (MSN), namely the right supplementarymotor cortex, the left superior temporal gyrus and the left inferior parietallobule. We concluded that structural abnormalities within the MSN may account forthe social cognitive deficits present in some psychiatric disorders, such asschizophrenia.
 False belief reasoning is a key Theory of Mind (ToM) competence. By four years ofage children understand that a person's behaviour can be based on a false belief about reality. Children cannot understand that a person's emotion can also bebased on a false belief before the age of six. In order to generate hypothesis onbasic processes distinguishing these two types of belief reasoning, the presentfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in adults directly comparesfunctional activity associated with these two false belief tasks. Both tasks wereassociated with activity in the ToM network including the medial prefrontalcortex (MPFC) and the left temporo-parietal junction (LTPJ). Differentialactivity was observed in the anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for false belief-based emotion relative to behaviour attribution. Contrary to falsebelief behaviour attribution, false belief-based emotion attribution requires theprocessing of two different mental states: a belief and an emotion and theirrelation to each other. The activity pattern may reflect the differential demandson cognitive processes associated with the two different belief-based attributionprocesses. These results shed new light on the still ongoing debate about thenature of the developmental lag between the two false belief tasks.
 We outline general theoretical and practical implications of what we promote asenactive cinema for the neuroscientific study of online socio-emotionalinteraction. In a real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI)setting, participants are immersed in cinematic experiences that simulate social situations. While viewing, their physiological reactions-including brainresponses-are tracked, representing implicit and unconscious experiences of theon-going social situations. These reactions, in turn, are analyzed in real-timeand fed back to modify the cinematic sequences they are viewing while beingscanned. Due to the engaging cinematic content, the proposed setting focuses onliving-by in terms of shared psycho-physiological epiphenomena of experiencerather than active coping in terms of goal-oriented motor actions. It constitutesa means to parametrically modify stimuli that depict social situations and their broader environmental contexts. As an alternative to studying the variation ofbrain responses as a function of a priori fixed stimuli, this method can beapplied to survey the range of stimuli that evoke similar responses acrossparticipants at particular brain regions of interest.
 Throughout adolescence, progress in the understanding of the moral domain as wellas changes in moral behavior is observable. We tested 16 adolescents (14-16 yearsof age) and 16 healthy adults (22-31 years of age) on the developmental changesin everyday moral decision making using functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI). Using verbal stories describing everyday moral conflict situations,subjects had to decide between a moral standard or a personal desire. In themoral conflict situations, adolescents not only chose significantly more oftenthe hedonistic alternative than adults, but they also reported higher certaintyratings. Contrasted with everyday social conflict situations that required adecision between a social-oriented behavior and a personal need, moral conflictsituations induced an activity increase in frontal areas, the middle temporalgyrus, the thalamus, and the parahippocampal gyrus in adolescents compared toadults. Moreover, a closer look at the moral conflict situations revealed thatadolescents showed more activity than adults in brain areas that are alsocentrally involved in theory of mind (ToM) during morally oriented decisions incontrast to personal-oriented decisions. This indicated that the development ofmoral reasoning may be strongly correlated with the development of ToM reasoning.
 Human civilization is based on the successful pursuit of long-term goals,requiring the ability to forego immediate pleasure for the sake of larger future rewards. This ability improves with age, but the precise cognitive and neuralmechanisms underlying its development remain elusive. The developmental changescould result either from younger children valuing immediate rewards more stronglyor because older children become better at controlling their impulses. Byimplementing 2 tasks, a choice-independent valuation task and an intertemporalchoice task, both behaviorally and using fMRI in twenty 6- to 13-year oldchildren, we show developmental improvements in behavioral control to uniquelyaccount for age-related changes in temporal discounting. We show further thatovercoming temptation during childhood occurs as a function of an age-relatedincrease in functional coupling between value signals in the ventromedialprefrontal cortex and brain regions dedicated to behavioral control, such as leftdorsolateral prefrontal cortex during choice. These findings can help to devisemeasures that reduce the substantial costs of impatience to society.
 Although cognitive neuroscience has made valuable progress in understanding therole of the prefrontal cortex in human intelligence, the functional networks thatsupport adaptive behavior and novel problem solving remain to be wellcharacterized. Here, we studied 158 human brain lesion patients to investigatethe cognitive and neural foundations of key competencies for fluid intelligenceand working memory. We administered a battery of neuropsychological tests,including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and the N-Back task.Latent variable modeling was applied to obtain error-free scores of fluidintelligence and working memory, followed by voxel-based lesion-symptom mappingto elucidate their neural substrates. The observed latent variable modeling andlesion results support an integrative framework for understanding thearchitecture of fluid intelligence and working memory and make specificrecommendations for the interpretation and application of the WAIS and N-Backtask to the study of fluid intelligence in health and disease.
 The ability to accurately estimate another person's preferences is crucial for a successful social life. In daily interactions, we often do this on the basis ofminimal information. The aims of the present study were (a) to examine whetherpeople can accurately judge others based only on a brief exposure to theirappearances, and (b) to reveal the underlying neural mechanisms with functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants were asked to make guesses about unfamiliar target individuals' preferences for various items after looking attheir faces for 3 s. The behavioral results showed that participants estimatedothers' preferences above chance level. The fMRI data revealed that higheraccuracy in preference estimation was associated with greater activity in thedorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) when participants were guessing thetargets' preferences relative to thinking about their own preferences. Thesefindings suggest that accurate estimations of others' preferences may requireincreased activity in the DMPFC. A functional connectivity analysis revealed thathigher accuracy in preference estimation was related to increased functionalconnectivity between the DMPFC and the brain regions that are known to beinvolved in theory of mind processing, such as the temporoparietal junction (TPJ)and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus, during correct vs. incorrect guessing trials. On the contrary, the tendency to refer to self-preferences when estimating others' preference was related to greater activity in the ventromedialprefrontal cortex. These findings imply that the DMPFC may be a core region inestimating the preferences of others and that higher accuracy may requirestronger communication between the DMPFC and the TPJ and PCC/precuneus, part of aneural network known to be engaged in mentalizing.
 In social neuroscience research, startle eyeblink modification can serve as amarker of emotion, but it is less clear whether it can also serve as a marker of prejudice. In Experiment 1, 30 White students viewed photographs of White andBlack targets while the startle eyeblink reflex and facial EMG from the brow and cheek regions were recorded. Prejudice was related to facial EMG activity, butnot to startle modification, which instead appeared to index attention to race.To test further whether racial categorizations are associated with differentialattention, a dual-task paradigm was used in Experiment 2. Fifty-four White andfifty-five Black participants responded more slowly to a tone presented whenviewing a racial outgroup member or a negative stimulus, indicating that bothdraw more attention than ingroup members or positive stimuli. We conclude thatstartle modification is useful to index differential attention to groups whenintergroup threat is low.
 Research has shown that the brain is constantly making predictions about futureevents. Theories of prediction in perception, action and learning suggest thatthe brain serves to reduce the discrepancies between expectation and actualexperience, i.e., by reducing the prediction error. Forward models of action and perception propose the generation of a predictive internal representation of the expected sensory outcome, which is matched to the actual sensory feedback. Sharedneural representations have been found when experiencing one's own and observing other's actions, rewards, errors, and emotions such as fear and pain. Thesegeneral principles of the "predictive brain" are well established and havealready begun to be applied to social aspects of cognition. The application andrelevance of these predictive principles to social cognition are discussed inthis article. Evidence is presented to argue that simple non-social cognitiveprocesses can be extended to explain complex cognitive processes required forsocial interaction, with common neural activity seen for both social andnon-social cognitions. A number of studies are included which demonstrate thatbottom-up sensory input and top-down expectancies can be modulated by socialinformation. The concept of competing social forward models and a partiallydistinct category of social prediction errors are introduced. The evolutionaryimplications of a "social predictive brain" are also mentioned, along with theimplications on psychopathology. The review presents a number of testablehypotheses and novel comparisons that aim to stimulate further discussion andintegration between currently disparate fields of research, with regard tocomputational models, behavioral and neurophysiological data. This promotes arelatively new platform for inquiry in social neuroscience with implications insocial learning, theory of mind, empathy, the evolution of the social brain, and potential strategies for treating social cognitive deficits.
 Cognition that is not based on perception can lead to at least two differentoutcomes. In some situations, cognition that is independent of perception canallow actions to be selected other than those prescribed by immediate perceptual input. In others, cognition can be independent of perception and unrelated to thecurrent behavioral goal allowing thoughts to develop that are largely independentof the actions involved in an external task. The default mode network (DMN) hasbeen implicated in both of these kinds of perceptually decoupled thought. Thecurrent experiment used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore whether a common region of this network was co-activated by both of these states. Boththe medial pre-frontal cortex and the posterior cingulate - two major hubs of theDMN - showed greater activity when (i) actions that did not depend upon immediateperceptual input were faster and (ii) when actions based on perceptual input wereslower. Together these data suggest that the DMN is important in cognition thatis independent from perceptual input regardless of whether such thoughts resultin action, or, instead compete with the behavioral goals of the moment.
 Cognitive control enables successful goal-directed behavior by resolving aconflict between opposing action tendencies, while emotional control arises as a consequence of emotional conflict processing such as in irony. While negativeemotion facilitates both cognitive and emotional conflict processing, it isunclear how emotional conflict processing is affected by positive emotion (e.g., humor). In 2 EEG experiments, we investigated the role of positive audiovisualtarget stimuli in cognitive and emotional conflict processing. Participantscategorized either spoken vowels (cognitive task) or their emotional valence(emotional task) and ignored the visual stimulus dimension. Behaviorally, apositive target showed no influence on cognitive conflict processing, but impededemotional conflict processing. In the emotional task, response time conflictcosts were higher for positive than for neutral targets. In the EEG, we observed an interaction of emotion by congruence in the P200 and N200 ERP components inemotional but not in cognitive conflict processing. In the emotional conflicttask, the P200 and N200 conflict effect was larger for emotional than neutraltargets. Thus, our results show that emotion affects conflict processingdifferently as a function of conflict type and emotional valence. This suggeststhat there are conflict- and valence-specific mechanisms modulating executivecontrol.
 Previous neuroimaging studies support the assumption of a strong link betweenperception and action, demonstrating that the motor system is involved whenothers' actions are observed. One question that is still open to debate is which aspects of observed actions engage the motor system. The present study testedwhether motor activation corresponds to the difficulty of the observed action,using Fitts's law. This law postulates that the difficulty of any movement (ID)is a function of the distance to the target (A) and the target width (W). In anobservation task, the ID of the observed action was manipulated orthogonally to W(by using five different As). The results revealed activity in the primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor area, and the basal ganglia in response toincreasing ID levels, but not in response to different levels of A or W. Thus,activation in the motor system during action observation is not driven byperceptual parameters but by the motor difficulty of the observed action.
 Children need opportunities to establish positive social connections at school,yet many school playgrounds are challenged by social conflict that can undermine these connections. When children's social needs go unmet, the resultant feelings of loneliness, isolation and self-doubt can cumulatively lead to mental andphysical illness. Because recess is typically the only time during the school daythat children are free to socialize and play, we propose a more thoughtful way ofthinking about it: from the lens of belongingness. Schools are, historically,designed for instruction. We argue, however, that we need to attend to children'ssocial needs at school. We highlight current research from social neuroscience,belonging and social connectedness in order to delineate the pathways betweendaily school recess and developmental health trajectories. We then consolidate anarray of research on play, social interaction and school change to suggest fourareas that could benefit from consideration in research, practice and policy: (i)the culture of recess, (ii) the importance of healthy role models on theplayground, (iii) the necessity of activities, options and variety during recess and (iv) the significance of space and spatial layout (indoor and outdoor). Webridge our discussion with the conception of health as described in the OttawaCharter and emphasize the need to build alliances across sectors to assistschools in their efforts to support children's overall health needs.
 Across many mammalian species there exist genetic and biological systems thatfacilitate the tendency to be social. Oxytocin is a neuropeptide involved insocial-approach behaviors in humans and others mammals. Although there exists alarge, mounting body of evidence showing that oxytocin signaling genes areassociated with human sociability, very little is currently known regarding theway the structural gene for oxytocin (OXT) confers individual differences inhuman sociability. In this study, we undertook a comprehensive approach toinvestigate the association between epigenetic modification of OXT via DNAmethylation, and overt measures of social processing, including self-report,behavior, and brain function and structure. Genetic data were collected viasaliva samples and analyzed to target and quantify DNA methylation across thepromoter region of OXT We observed a consistent pattern of results acrosssociability measures. People that exhibit lower OXT DNA methylation (presumablylinked to higher OXT expression) display more secure attachment styles, improved ability to recognize emotional facial expressions, greater superior temporalsulcus activity during two social-cognitive functional MRI tasks, and largerfusiform gyrus gray matter volume than people that exhibit higher OXT DNAmethylation. These findings provide empirical evidence that epigeneticmodification of OXT is linked to several overt measures of sociability in humans and serve to advance progress in translational social neuroscience researchtoward a better understanding of the evolutionary and genetic basis of normal andabnormal human sociability.
 Language is generally viewed as conveying information through symbols whose form is arbitrarily related to their meaning. This arbitrary relation is often assumedto also characterize the mental representations underlying languagecomprehension. We explore the idea that visuo-spatial information can beanalogically conveyed through acoustic properties of speech and that suchinformation is integrated into an analog perceptual representation as a naturalpart of comprehension. Listeners heard sentences describing objects, spoken atvarying speaking rates. After each sentence, participants saw a picture of anobject and judged whether it had been mentioned in the sentence. Participantswere faster to recognize the object when motion implied by speaking rate matched the motion implied by the picture. Results suggest that visuo-spatial referentialinformation can be analogically conveyed and represented.
 Successful human interaction is based on correct recognition, interpretation, andappropriate reaction to facial affect. In depression, social skill deficits areamong the most restraining symptoms leading to social withdrawal, therebyaggravating social isolation and depressive affect. Dysfunctional approach andwithdrawal tendencies to emotional stimuli have been documented, but theinvestigation of their neural underpinnings has received limited attention. Weperformed an fMRI study including 15 depressive patients and 15 matched, healthy controls. All subjects performed two tasks, an implicit joystick task as well as an explicit rating task, both using happy, neutral, and angry facial expressions.Behavioral data analysis indicated a significant group effect, with depressedpatients showing more withdrawal than controls. Analysis of the functional datarevealed significant group effects for both tasks. Among other regions, weobserved significant group differences in amygdala activation, with patientsshowing less response particularly during approach to happy faces. Additionally, significant correlations of amygdala activation with psychopathology emerged,suggesting that more pronounced symptoms are accompanied by stronger decreases ofamygdala activation. Hence, our results demonstrate that depressed patients show dysfunctional social approach and withdrawal behavior, which in turn mayaggravate the disorder by negative social interactions contributing to isolation and reinforcing cognitive biases.
 Empathy has two key components: affective and cognitive. It relies on "embodied" processes such as the generation, representation and perception of feelingstates. People diagnosed with Depersonalization Disorder (DPD) reportdisturbances in affective experience, such as emotional numbing, alongsideaberrations in "body image" such as increased self-focus and feelings of"disembodiment". DPD therefore provides a test bed for the role of suchself-related processes in empathy. We tested 16 participants diagnosed with DPDand 48 control volunteers on measures of cognitive and affective empathy. We usedself-report measures (EQ; Baron-Cohen & Wheelwright, 2004), an objective measure of cognitive empathy-the "Eyes" task (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Hill, Raste, &Plumb, 2001), and a novel task tapping affective empathy, utilizing speech rateas an implicit measure of physiological arousal. We also measured participants'tendency to use mental representations that relate to the self during theaffective empathy task. The DPD group showed intact performance on the cognitive empathy task. However, there was a disruption in the physiological component ofaffective empathy alongside a more pronounced reliance on mental representations of the self. These findings suggest affective empathy to be reliant on intactemotional experience in the observer. In addition, excessive self-focus may bedetrimental to an empathic response.
 A large (250 registrants) General Education lecture course, Pleasure and Pain,presented basic neuroscience principles as they related to animal and humanmodels of pleasure and pain by weaving basic findings related to food and drugaddiction and analgesic states with human studies examining empathy, socialneuroscience and neuroeconomics. In its first four years, the course grade wasbased on weighted scores from two multiple-choice exams and a five-page review ofthree unique peer-reviewed research articles. Although well-registered andwell-received, 18% of the students received Incomplete grades, primarily due tofailing to submit the paper that went largely unresolved and eventually resulted in a failing grade. To rectify this issue, a modified version of the C.R.E.A.T.E.(Consider, Read, Elucidate hypotheses, Analyze and interpret data, Think of thenext Experiment) method replaced the paper with eight structured assignmentsfocusing on an initial general-topic article, the introduction-methods, andresults-discussion of each of three related peer-review neuroscience-relatedarticles, and a final summary. Compliance in completing these assignments wasvery high, resulting in only 11 INC grades out of 228 students. Thus, use of the C.R.E.A.T.E. method reduced the percentage of problematic INC grades from 18% to 4.8%, a 73% decline, without changing the overall grade distribution. Otheranalyses suggested the students achieved a deeper understanding of the scientificprocess using the C.R.E.A.T.E. method relative to the original term paperassignment.
 BACKGROUND: Recent neuroscientific evidence suggests that empathy for painactivates similar neural representations as the first-hand experience of pain.However, empathy is not an all-or-none phenomenon but it is strongly malleable byinterpersonal, intrapersonal and situational factors. This study investigated howtwo different top-down mechanisms - attention and cognitive appraisal - affectthe perception of pain in others and its neural underpinnings.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed one behavioral (N = 23) and twofunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments (N = 18). In the firstfMRI experiment, participants watched photographs displaying painful needleinjections, and were asked to evaluate either the sensory or the affectiveconsequences of these injections. The role of cognitive appraisal was examined ina second fMRI experiment in which participants watched injections that onlyappeared to be painful as they were performed on an anesthetized hand. Perceivingpain in others activated the affective-motivational and sensory-discriminativeaspects of the pain matrix. Activity in the somatosensory areas was specifically enhanced when participants evaluated the sensory consequences of pain. Perceivingnon-painful injections into the anesthetized hand also led to signal increase in large parts of the pain matrix, suggesting an automatic affective response to theputatively harmful stimulus. This automatic response was modulated by areasinvolved in self/other distinction and valence attribution - including thetemporo-parietal junction and medial orbitofrontal cortex.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings elucidate how top-down control mechanisms and automatic bottom-up processes interact to generate and modulateother-oriented responses. They stress the role of cognitive processing inempathy, and shed light on how emotional and bodily awareness enable us toevaluate the sensory and affective states of others.
 Neuroscience research suggests that inferring neutral intentions of other people recruits a specific brain network within the inferior fronto-parietal actionobservation network as well as a putative social network including brain areassubserving theory of mind, such as the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS),the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), and also the anterior cingulate cortex(ACC). Recent studies on harmful intentions have refined this network by showing the specific involvement of the ACC, amygdala, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex(vmPFC) in early stages (within 200 ms) of information processing. However, thefunctional dynamics for kind intentions within and among these networks remainsunclear. To address this question, we measured electrical brain activity from 18 healthy adult participants while they were performing an intention inference taskwith three different types of intentions: kind, hostile and non-interactive.Electrophysiological results revealed that kind intentions were characterized by significantly larger peak amplitudes of N2 over the frontal sites than those for hostile and non-interactive intentions. On the other hand, there were nosignificant differences between hostile and non-interactive intentions at N2. Thesource analysis suggested that the vicinity of the left cingulate gyruscontributed to the N2 effect by subtracting the kindness condition from thenon-interactive condition within 250-350 ms. At a later stage (i.e., during the270-500 ms epoch), the peak amplitude of the P3 over the parietal sites and theright hemisphere was significantly larger for hostile intentions compared to the kind and non-interactive intentions. No significant differences were observed at P3 between kind and non-interactive intentions. The source analysis showed thatthe vicinity of the left anterior cingulate cortex contributed to the P3 effectby subtracting the hostility condition from the non-interactive condition within 450-550 ms. The present study provides preliminary evidence of thespatio-temporal dynamics sustaining the dissociation between the understandingsof different types of social intentions.
 The emotional consequences of our own and others' actions can influence ouragentive self-awareness in social contexts. Positive outcomes are usually linked to the self and used for self-enhancement, whereas negative outcomes are moreoften attributed to others. In most situations, these causal attributiontendencies seem to be immediately present instead of involving reflectiveinterpretations of the action experience. To address the question at which level of the cognitive hierarchy emotions and action perception interact, we adopted a social reward anticipation paradigm. Here, participants or their interactionpartner received positive or negative action outcomes and performed speededattribution choices regarding causation of the action outcome. Event-RelatedPotential (ERP) results showed that the emotional value of an outcome alreadyinfluenced the classical N1 self-attenuation effect, with reduced embodiedagentive self-awareness for negative outcomes at initial sensorimotor stages. At the level of the N300, the degree of updating and affective evaluation associatedwith the respective attributive decision was reflected and particularlyassociated to attribution tendencies for positive events. Our results show anearly interaction between emotion and agency processes, and suggest thatself-serving cognition can be grounded in embodied knowledge from low-levelsensorimotor mechanisms.
 OBJECTIVE: The objective of this prospective, naturalistic study, conducted infirst-episode psychosis patients from a Central-European population, was toassess the utility of Cytochrome P-450 2D6 (CYP2D6) genotype testing under normalclinical setting. METHODS: A total of 35 patients diagnosed for the first timewith schizophrenia or acute schizophrenia-like psychotic disorder and treatedwith risperidone were enrolled in the study. These patients underwentsequentiation of the CYP2D6 gene and evaluations of symptoms and severity ofadverse effects using the PANSS and UKU scales, respectively. Doses ofantipsychotics and other co-medication were monitored as well. In statisticalanalysis, Fisher's exact test was used to compare ratios and the Wilcoxonrank-sum test was used in the comparison of continual variables. RESULTS: PMpatients showed a significantly lower reduction in psychotic symptoms and agreater severity of psychotic symptoms following risperidone treatment and higherdoses of antipsychotics not metabolized by CYP2D6, which were used asco-medication. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, patients with the PM genotypeexperiencing first-episode schizophrenia don't appear to be optimal recipients ofrisperidone treatment. However, as the main limitation of this study was therelatively small sample-size, replication with a larger scale study is needed to confirm these findings.
 In the present study, we explored the contribution of different cortical areas inprocessing different semantic violations in action representation--that is,instrumental or functional violations. The cortical contribution inobject-related action comprehension was verified by measuring changes inevent-related potential (N400 effect), error rates (ERs), and response times(RTs), by applying an inhibitory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Thirty-three subjects performedthe detection task (action frames ending with a congruous vs. incongruousaction). The tDCS effect was analyzed by comparing the N400, ERs, and RTs before and after stimulation. A significant reduction of the N400 and increased RTs wereobserved for incongruous stimuli in the case of inhibitory stimulation of theDLPFC. These results highlighted that DLPFC inhibition may limit the ability toanalyze a semantically incongruous action, with a reduced N400 ERP effect andincreased "cognitive costs" (higher RTs). Moreover, functional violation showedalso the contribution of the temporoparietal areas to modulate the N400amplitude. Therefore the existence of different cortical generators was supposed for the instrumental (more frontal) and the functional (more frontal andtemporoparietal) semantic anomaly processing.
 Studying the neural basis of human social interactions is a key topic in thefield of social neuroscience. Brain imaging studies in this field usually focuson the neural correlates of the social interactions between two participants.However, as the participant number further increases, even by a small amount,great difficulties raise. One challenge is how to concurrently scan all theinteracting brains with high ecological validity, especially for a large numberof participants. The other challenge is how to effectively model the complexgroup interaction behaviors emerging from the intricate neural informationexchange among a group of socially organized people. Confronting thesechallenges, we propose a new approach called "Cluster Imaging of Multi-brainNetworks" (CIMBN). CIMBN consists of two parts. The first part is a clusterimaging technique with high ecological validity based on multiple functionalnear-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) systems. Using this technique, we can easilyextend the simultaneous imaging capacity of social neuroscience studies up todozens of participants. The second part of CIMBN is a multi-brain network (MBN)modeling method based on graph theory. By taking each brain as a network node andthe relationship between any two brains as a network edge, one can construct anetwork model for a group of interacting brains. The emergent group socialbehaviors can then be studied using the network's properties, such as itstopological structure and information exchange efficiency. Although there isstill much work to do, as a general framework for hyperscanning and modeling agroup of interacting brains, CIMBN can provide new insights into the neuralcorrelates of group social interactions, and advance social neuroscience andsocial psychology.
 With the aim of understanding how different mental or intentional states areprocessed in the brain, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study examined the brain correlates during the ascription of belief intentionalstates relative to desire intentional states as well as the effect of incongruentrelative to congruent intentional states. To this end, sentences containingscenarios were presented to participants and their task was to make judgmentsconcerning the ascription of intentional states based on this information. Beliefascriptions, relative to desire ascriptions, were accompanied by activations inlateral prefrontal structures that include areas known to be involved inrelational and conceptual reasoning. Desire ascriptions, in contrast, wereaccompanied by activations in regions of the medial prefrontal cortex, superiortemporal gyri and hippocampal formation, all of which are known for theirinvolvement in self-referential, autobiographical and episodic memory-relevantprocesses. In addition, the ascription of intentional states that wereincongruent with reality (false beliefs and unfulfilled desires) was compared to the ascription of intentional states that were congruent to reality (true belief and fulfilled desires). While no brain region was selectively activated duringthe processing of unfulfilled desires, the processing of false beliefs wasassociated with stronger activations in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, anarea that has been previously linked to the process of decoupling in false beliefattribution. These findings provide new insights into more fine-grained aspectsof mental state reasoning.
 Current theory suggests that the processing of different types of threat issupported by distinct neural networks. Here we tested whether there are distinct neural correlates associated with different types of threat processing inshyness. Using fMRI and multivariate techniques, we compared neural responses andfunctional connectivity during the processing of imminent (i.e., congruentangry/angry face pairs) and ambiguous (i.e., incongruent angry/neutral facepairs) social threat in young adults selected for high and low shyness. To bothtypes of threat processing, non-shy adults recruited a right medial prefrontalcortex (mPFC) network encompassing nodes of the default mode network involved in automatic emotion regulation, whereas shy adults recruited a right dorsalanterior cingulate cortex (dACC) network encompassing nodes of the frontoparietalnetwork that instantiate active attentional and cognitive control. Furthermore,in shy adults, the mPFC interacted with the dACC network for ambiguous threat,but with a distinct network encompassing nodes of the salience network forimminent threat. These preliminary results expand our understanding of right mPFCfunction associated with temperamental shyness. They also provide initialevidence for differential neural networks associated with shy and non-shyprofiles in the context of different types of social threat processing.
 Arousal reflects a state of generalised physiological activation, and its keyrole in cognition and behaviour has been extensively described. The regulation ofarousal is controlled by specific nuclei located in the brainstem that containwidely distributed projections to the cortex and form the arousal systems. Inhumans, arousal has been commonly studied and modulated through behaviouralparadigms, whereas in animals, direct electrical stimulation has been used toconfirm the important role of these widely distributed structures. Recentevidence suggests that it might be possible to use transcranial electricalstimulation (tES) to non-invasively induce currents in the brainstem regions ofthe brain. Therefore, we hypothesise that, using a specific electrodearrangement, it might be possible to employ tES to stimulate subcortical-corticalneuromodulatory networks, inducing modulation of general arousal. The aim of the present study was to determine if it is possible to increase arousal during adiscriminative reaction times (RTs) task, through the application of tES, toimprove the subjects' performance. We developed 3 experiments: Experiment 1validated the behavioural task, which was an adapted version of the continuousperformance test. Experiment 2 aimed to show the task sensitivity to the level ofactivation. The results confirmed that the task was sensitive enough to revealmodulations of arousal. In Experiment 3, we applied bursts of tES concurrent withthe onset of the relevant stimuli of the task to increase the physiologicalphasic activation of arousal. The skin conductance response was recorded duringthe experiment in addition to the RTs. The results showed a reduction of RTs and a concurrent increase in skin conductance during the real stimulation condition, which is consistent with a general increase in arousal. In all, these datasupport the effectiveness of bursts of tES in modulating arousal.
 Working together feels easier with some people than with others. We askedparticipants to perform a visual search task either alone or with a partner whilesimultaneously measuring each participant's EEG. Local phase synchronization and inter-brain phase synchronization were generally higher when subjects jointlyattended to a visual search task than when they attended to the same taskindividually. Some participants searched the visual display more efficiently and made faster decisions when working as a team, whereas other dyads did not benefitfrom working together. These inter-team differences in behavioral performancegain in the visual search task were reliably associated with inter-teamdifferences in local and inter-brain phase synchronization. Our results suggestthat phase synchronization constitutes a neural correlate of social facilitation,and may help to explain why some teams perform better than others.
 Being on the social perimeter is not only sad, it is dangerous. Our evolutionary model of the effects of perceived social isolation (loneliness) on the brain aswell as a growing body of behavioral research suggests that loneliness promotesshort-term self-preservation, including an increased implicit vigilance forsocial, in contrast to nonsocial, threats. However, this hypothesis has not been tested previously in a neuroimaging study. We therefore used high density EEG anda social Stroop interference task to test the hypothesis that implicit attention to negative social, in contrast to nonsocial, Words in the Stroop task differsbetween individuals high versus low in loneliness and to investigate the braindynamics of implicit processing for negative social (vs nonsocial) stimuli inlonely individuals, compared to nonlonely individuals (N = 70). The present studyprovides the first evidence that negative social stimuli are differentiated from negative nonsocial stimuli more quickly in the lonely than nonlonely brains.Given the timing of this differentiation in the brain and the fact thatparticipants were performing a Stroop task, these results also suggest that thesedifferences reflect implicit rather than explicit attentional differences betweenlonely and nonlonely individuals. Source estimates were performed for purposes ofhypothesis generation regarding underlying neural mechanisms, and the resultsimplicated the neural circuits reminiscent of orienting and executive controlaspects of attention as contributing to these differences. Together, the results are in accord with the evolutionary model of loneliness.
 Instinctively responding to maternal face is an evolutionary function ofenhancing survival and development. However, because of the confounding nature offamiliarity, little is known concerning the neural mechanism involved in maternalface recognition. We had a rare opportunity to examine Mosuo preschool childrenwho were raised in a matrilineal society in which mothers and aunts representequally familiar faces to the children. The participants were exposed tophotographs of their mother's face, aunt's face, and an unfamiliar female's facesduring electroencephalography (EEG) recording. The EEG results showed that themother's face elicited a more negative N1 component, a larger left N170component, and a larger P300 component; both the mother's and aunt's faceselicited a larger right N170 component. These results suggest that the emotional attachment between mother and child has neural ramifications across threesuccessive face processing stages that are distinguished from the neural effects of facial familiarity.
 Interactions between adult conspecifics, including sexual behaviors, affiliation,and aggression are crucial for the well-being, survival, and reproduction ofmammals. This holds true for any mammalian species, but certainly for humans: An inability to optimally navigate the social system can have a strong negativeimpact on physical and mental health. Translational rodent models have been used for decades to unravel the neural pathways and substrates involved in normal and abnormal conspecific interactions. Researchers in the field of translationalsocial neuroscience face a double challenge: Not only do they need to payconsiderable attention to the behavioral ecology of their model species or their ancestors, they also have to expect a relatively large variability in behaviorand adjust their experimental design accordingly. In this chapter, we will layout traditional and novel rodent models and paradigms to study sexual,affiliative, and aggressive interactions among adult conspecifics. We willdiscuss the merits and main findings and briefly consider the most promisingnovel directions. Finally, we review the modulatory involvement of two majorplayers in mammal social interaction: the central oxytocin and vasopressinsystem.
 The emerging fields of social neuroscience and neuroeconomics have started toinvestigate the neural foundations of empathy and fairness. Even though notfrequently linked, both concepts point to humans as altruistic beings who carefor others. Recently social neuroscientists have measured brain activityassociated with different empathic processes and revealed common neural responseswhen feeling sensations such as disgust, touch or pain in ourselves, and whenperceiving someone else being disgusted, touched or in pain. At the same time,research in neuroeconomics has used game theoretical paradigms to study our senseof fairness. Several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies showinvolvement of anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex in response tounfair compared with fair offers during such monetary exchange games.Interestingly, the same brain regions are also involved in empathy for pain ordisgust of others. More generally, anterior insula cortex is suggested tosubserve neural representations of feeling and bodily states in the self and may play a crucial role for the emergence of social emotions related to others.
 Real behaviors are binding consequential commitments to a course of action, such as harming another person, buying an Apple watch, or fleeing from danger.Cognitive scientists are generally interested in the psychological and neuralprocesses that cause such real behavior. However, for practical reasons, manyscientific studies measure behavior using only hypothetical or imagined stimuli. Generalizing from such studies to real behavior implicitly assumes that theprocesses underlying the two types of behavior are similar. We review evidence ofsimilarity and differences in hypothetical and real mental processes. In manycases, hypothetical choice tasks give an incomplete picture of brain circuitrythat is active during real choice.
 Recent approaches suggest that emotional reactivity can be used to differentiate between subgroups of individuals who are at risk for showing elevated levels ofaggression and violence. In this study, we examined how emotion governs decision making within two subgroups of antisocial criminal offenders with eitheremotional hypo- or hyper-reactivity compared with healthy, noncriminal controls. Offenders were recruited from high-security forensic treatment facilities andpenal institutions and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during afinancial decision-making task. In this task, participants were required tochoose between low-risk (bonds) and high-risk alternatives (stocks). Bonds werealways the safe choice; stocks could win or lose, with a varying degree ofuncertainty. We found that emotionally hypo-reactive offenders differed most fromhealthy controls by showing diminished neural activation in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex in response to uncertainty as well as decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex when trying to regulate their behavior accordingly (i.e., when consistently choosing "safe alternatives"). Hence, the data indicate thatemotionally hypo-reactive offenders (with psychopathic traits) constitute aspecial subgroup within antisocial offenders characterized in particular by alimited capacity to emotionally represent uncertainty and to anticipatepunishment.
 There is growing evidence that social support can buffer the physiological stressresponse, specifically cortisol reactivity. We use a developmental framework toreview the importance of social buffering in early childhood, a period ofheightened plasticity for programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)axis. The social environment, in which parents play the largest role in earlylife, is a critical agent in the developmental trajectory of the HPA axis. Aprevailing model of social buffering primarily focuses on the role of socialsupport in the context of acute stressors and cortisol response. This reviewexpands this model to provide evidence of the mechanism of social buffering, orlack thereof, across periods of chronic stress by applying the social buffermodel to children involved in the child welfare system. We also highlight currentinterventions that capitalize on the mechanism of social buffering to modify HPA axis functioning across childhood. Last, we synthesize our findings using thesocial buffering framework to inform future targeted interventions.
 Over-generalization of dangerous stimuli is a possible etiological account ofanxiety. Recently, we demonstrated it could result from alterations in earlyperceptual mechanisms, i.e., a fundamental change in the way the stimulus isperceived. Yet it is still unclear if these mechanisms already exist in youth, ordevelop only later. The purpose of this study was therefore to explore themechanism of generalization in youth suffering from anxiety disorders. Childrenand adolescents with anxiety disorders and age-matched control participantsunderwent a conditioning task where a loss or gain outcome was associated withtwo well-separated tones. A generalization probe then followed in which differentsurrounding tones were presented and classified. Generalization curves andchanges in discrimination abilities were compared between groups and according tothe background variables. We found that patients had lower perceptualdiscrimination thresholds after conditioning, and tended to have widergeneralization curve. Relative enhanced generalization was observed inadolescents with anxiety, in males, and as the level of anxiety rose. Our resultssuggest that over-generalization in anxiety can start already during adolescence,and may suggest that an early perceptual source can give rise to later morecognitive over-generalization during adult anxiety.
 Attributing mind to interaction partners has been shown to increase the socialrelevance we ascribe to others' actions and to modulate the amount of attentiondedicated to them. However, it remains unclear how the relationship betweenhigher-order mind attribution and lower-level attention processes is established in the brain. In this neuroimaging study, participants saw images of ananthropomorphic robot that moved its eyes left- or rightwards to signal theappearance of an upcoming stimulus in the same (valid cue) or opposite location(invalid cue). Independently, participants' beliefs about the intentionalityunderlying the observed eye movements were manipulated by describing the eyemovements as under human control or preprogrammed. As expected, we observed avalidity effect behaviorally and neurologically (increased response times andactivation in the invalid vs. valid condition). More importantly, we observedthat this effect was more pronounced for the condition in which the robot'sbehavior was believed to be controlled by a human, as opposed to bepreprogrammed. This interaction effect between cue validity and belief was,however, only found at the neural level and was manifested as a significantincrease of activation in bilateral anterior temporoparietal junction.
 To recognize whether another person's action results in a good or bad outcome is imperative for social learning, as well as for understanding the behavior ofothers in a broad context. Recent studies have reported that a scalp-surfaceevent-related potential (ERP) called medial-frontal negativity (MFN), considered to be an index of negative reward processing, is generated when perceiving notonly one's own losses, but also those of others. This suggests that the sameneural mechanisms operate in monitoring one's own actions and in perceiving theconsequences of the actions of others. To further elucidate the properties ofthis "observational" MFN, this study examined whether its amplitude differs with different observational targets. In a gambling task, participants observed theperformances of non-self agents: a human friend and PC programs. The outcomes of the decisions of these agents were not associated with the participants' ownbenefits. ERP results showed that the MFN-like pattern was significantly elicitedonly when observing the outcomes of decisions made by human agents. Furthermore, self-reported measures of empathy were positively associated with the magnitudeof the observational MFN. These findings suggest that the neural activity innon-self reward processing reflects a socioemotional state generated by thetarget of observation, as well as an empathetic trait of the individual.
 The recognition of emotional facial expressions is an important means to adjustbehavior in social interactions. As facial expressions widely differ in theirduration and degree of expressiveness, they often manifest with short andtransient expressions below the level of awareness. In this combined behavioraland fMRI study, we aimed at examining whether or not consciously accessible(subliminal) emotional facial expressions influence empathic judgments and which brain activations are related to it. We hypothesized that subliminal facialexpressions of emotions masked with neutral expressions of the same faces induce an empathic processing similar to consciously accessible (supraliminal) facialexpressions. Our behavioral data in 23 healthy subjects showed that subliminalemotional facial expressions of 40 ms duration affect the judgments of thesubsequent neutral facial expressions. In the fMRI study in 12 healthy subjectsit was found that both, supra- and subliminal emotional facial expressions shareda widespread network of brain areas including the fusiform gyrus, thetemporo-parietal junction, and the inferior, dorsolateral, and medial frontalcortex. Compared with subliminal facial expressions, supraliminal facialexpressions led to a greater activation of left occipital and fusiform faceareas. We conclude that masked subliminal emotional information is suited totrigger processing in brain areas which have been implicated in empathy and,thereby in social encounters.
 High-level cognitive and emotional experience arises from brain activity, but thespecific brain substrates for religious and spiritual euphoria remain unclear. Wedemonstrate using functional magnetic resonance imaging scans in 19 devoutMormons that a recognizable feeling central to their devotional practice wasreproducibly associated with activation in nucleus accumbens, ventromedialprefrontal cortex, and frontal attentional regions. Nucleus accumbens activation preceded peak spiritual feelings by 1-3 s and was replicated in four separatetasks. Attentional activation in the anterior cingulate and frontal eye fieldswas greater in the right hemisphere. The association of abstract ideas and brain reward circuitry may interact with frontal attentional and emotive salienceprocessing, suggesting a mechanism whereby doctrinal concepts may come to beintrinsically rewarding and motivate behavior in religious individuals.
 The ability to recognize one's own reflection is shared by humans and only a few other species, including chimpanzees. However, this ability is highly variableacross individual chimpanzees. In humans, self-recognition involves adistributed, right-lateralized network including frontal and parietal regionsinvolved in the production and perception of action. The superior longitudinalfasciculus (SLF) is a system of white matter tracts linking these frontal andparietal regions. The current study measured mirror self-recognition (MSR) andSLF anatomy in 60 chimpanzees using diffusion tensor imaging. Successfulself-recognition was associated with greater rightward asymmetry in the whitematter of SLFII and SLFIII, and in SLFIII's gray matter terminations in Broca'sarea. We observed a visible progression of SLFIII's prefrontal extension in apes that show negative, ambiguous, and compelling evidence of MSR. Notably, SLFIII's terminations in Broca's area are not right-lateralized or particularly pronouncedat the population level in chimpanzees, as they are in humans. Thus, chimpanzees with more human-like behavior show more human-like SLFIII connectivity. Theseresults suggest that self-recognition may have co-emerged with adaptations tofrontoparietal circuitry.
 This article introduces the special issue of 'Social Cognitive and AffectiveNeuroscience' on Aging Research, and offers a broad conceptual and methodologicalframework for considering advances in life course research in social neuroscienceand neuroeconomics. The authors highlight key areas of inquiry where agingresearch is raising new insights about how to conceptualize and examine critical questions about the links between cognition, emotion and motivation in social andeconomic behavior, as well as challenges that need to be addressed when taking a life course perspective in these fields. They also point to several emergingapproaches that hold the potential for addressing these challenges, throughbridging approaches from laboratory and population-based science, bridginginquiry across life stages and expanding measurement of core psychologicalphenotypes.
 Tonotopic map plasticity in the adult auditory cortex (AC) is a well established and oft-cited measure of auditory associative learning in classical conditioning paradigms. However, its necessity as an enduring memory trace has been debated,especially given a recent finding that the areal expansion of core AC tuned to a newly relevant frequency range may arise only transiently to support auditorylearning. This has been reinforced by an ethological paradigm showing that mapexpansion is not observed for ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) or for ultrasoundfrequencies in postweaning dams for whom USVs emitted by pups acquire behavioral relevance. However, whether transient expansion occurs during maternal experienceis not known, and could help to reveal the generality of cortical map expansionas a correlate for auditory learning. We thus mapped the auditory cortices ofmaternal mice at postnatal time points surrounding the peak in pup USV emission, but found no evidence of frequency map expansion for the behaviorally relevanthigh ultrasound range in AC. Instead, regions tuned to low frequencies outside ofthe ultrasound range show progressively greater suppression of activity inresponse to the playback of ultrasounds or pup USVs for maternally experiencedanimals assessed at their pups' postnatal day 9 (P9) to P10, or postweaning. Thisprovides new evidence for a lateral-band suppression mechanism elicited bybehaviorally meaningful USVs, likely enhancing their population-levelsignal-to-noise ratio. These results demonstrate that tonotopic map enlargementhas limits as a construct for conceptualizing how experience leaves neural memorytraces within sensory cortex in the context of ethological auditory learning.
 Loss of a partner can have severe effects on mental health. Here we explore theneural mechanisms underlying increased passive stress-coping, indicative ofdepressive-like behavior, following the loss of the female partner in themonogamous male prairie vole. We demonstrate that corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 2 (CRFR2) in the nucleus accumbens shell mediates social loss-inducedpassive coping. Further, we show that partner loss compromises the oxytocinsystem through multiple mechanisms. Finally, we provide evidence for aninteraction of the CRFR2 and oxytocin systems in mediating the emotionalconsequences of partner loss. Our results suggest that chronic activation ofCRFR2 and suppression of striatal oxytocin signaling following partner lossresult in an aversive emotional state that may share underlying mechanisms withbereavement. We propose that the suppression of oxytocin signaling is likelyadaptive during short separations to encourage reunion with the partner and mayhave evolved to maintain long-term partnerships. Additionally, therapeuticstrategies targeting these systems should be considered for treatment of socialloss-mediated depression.
 The use of hypothetical moral dilemmas--which pit utilitarian considerations ofwelfare maximization against emotionally aversive "personal" harms--has become a widespread approach for studying the neuropsychological correlates of moraljudgment in healthy subjects, as well as in clinical populations with social,cognitive, and affective deficits. In this article, we propose that a refinement of the standard stimulus set could provide an opportunity to more preciselyidentify the psychological factors underlying performance on this task, andthereby enhance the utility of this paradigm for clinical research. To test this proposal, we performed a re-analysis of previously published moral judgment data from two clinical populations: neurological patients with prefrontal brain damageand psychopathic criminals. The results provide intriguing preliminary supportfor further development of this assessment paradigm.
 The main objective of this study was to investigate the contribution of somepersonality traits to the physiological and psychological response to astandardized laboratory psychosocial stressor (trier social stress test).Cortisol and affective response (anxiety and mood) were analysed in a mixed-sexgroup composed of 35 young adults who participated in a crossover design (18 men and 17 women). After verifying a statistically significant response to the trier social stress test in all parameters studied in both sex groups, exploratorycluster analyses were carried out to identify sub-groups based on theirpsychophysiological responses. These analyses showed two different groups:subjects displaying lower psychological response along with higher cortisolresponse (cluster 1) compared with the group with high affective reactivity alongwith lower cortisol response (cluster 2). Interestingly, we also foundsignificant differences in trait anxiety and coping styles when the two clusters were compared. Subjects in cluster 1 showed lower scores on trait anxiety andhigher scores on active coping, whereas the subjects in the second clusterobtained higher scores on anxiety and on coping focused on emotions and mentaldisengagement. These findings support the importance of personality traits andcoping styles in understanding the overall integrative psychobiologicalresponsiveness to social stress.
 BACKGROUND: The correct outcome of transitive actions depends on an object's use,considering both the instrumental and functional features. Indeed, therepresentation of transitive action includes the correct/incorrect instrumentaluse and the congruous/incongruous functional use of the object. OBJECTIVES: Thecontribution of frontal (experiment 1) and posterior parietal (experiment 2)areas to process semantic violations in instrumental vs. functional actionrepresentation was explored. METHODS: These cortical areas were appositelymodulated by anodal tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation) or sham tDCSwhen 43 healthy subjects processed semantic violations (congruous/incongruouspairs) and they had to perform an error detection task (measuring ERs - errorrates; and RTs - response times). RESULTS: Decreased RTs were observed forincongruous pairs in the case of prefrontal stimulation compared to the shamcondition. This effect was related to both the instrumental and functionalconditions, suggesting that the activation of the prefrontal area may increasethe ability to analyze the semantic incongruence independently from the anomalytype, which would limit the cognitive costs. In contrast, posterior parietalstimulation reduced RTs only in response to functional action in the case ofsemantic incongruence. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, different cortical contributions byanterior vs. posterior areas occurred in response to semantic incongruencesrespectively for generic expectancy violations (more frontally distributed) andspecific functional violations (more parietally distributed).
 "Mindfulness" is a capacity for heightened present-moment awareness that we allpossess to a greater or lesser extent. Enhancing this capacity through traininghas been shown to alleviate stress and promote physical and mental well-being. Asa consequence, interest in mindfulness is growing and so is the need to betterunderstand it. This study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)to identify the brain regions involved in state mindfulness and to shed light on its mechanisms of action. Significant signal decreases were observed duringmindfulness meditation in midline cortical structures associated withinteroception, including bilateral anterior insula, left ventral anteriorcingulate cortex, right medial prefrontal cortex, and bilateral precuneus.Significant signal increase was noted in the right posterior cingulate cortex.These findings lend support to the theory that mindfulness achieves its positive outcomes through a process of disidentification.
 Performing an action and observing it activate the same internal representations of action. The representations are therefore shared between self and other(shared representations of action, SRA). But what exactly is shared? At whatlevel within the hierarchical structure of the motor system do SRA occur?Understanding the content of SRA is important in order to decide what theoreticalwork SRA can perform. In this paper, we provide some conceptual clarification by raising three main questions: (i) are SRA semantic or pragmatic representationsof action?; (ii) are SRA sensory or motor representations?; (iii) are SRArepresentations of the action as a global unit or as a set of elementary motorcomponents? After outlining a model of the motor hierarchy, we conclude that the best candidate for SRA is intentions in action, defined as the motor plans of thedynamic sequence of movements. We shed new light on SRA by highlighting thecausal efficacy of intentions in action. This in turn explains phenomena such as inhibition of imitation.
 Recent development in diffusion spectrum brain imaging combined to functionalsimulation has the potential to further our understanding of how structure anddynamics are intertwined in the human brain. At the intra-individual scale,neurocomputational models have already started to uncover how the humanconnectome constrains the coordination of brain activity across distributed brainregions. In parallel, at the inter-individual scale, nascent social neuroscience provides a new dynamical vista of the coupling between two embodied cognitiveagents. Using EEG hyperscanning to record simultaneously the brain activities of subjects during their ongoing interaction, we have previously demonstrated thatbehavioral synchrony correlates with the emergence of inter-brainsynchronization. However, the functional meaning of such synchronization remains to be specified. Here, we use a biophysical model to quantify to what extentinter-brain synchronizations are related to the anatomical and functionalsimilarity of the two brains in interaction. Pairs of interacting brains werenumerically simulated and compared to real data. Results show a potentialdynamical property of the human connectome to facilitate inter-individualsynchronizations and thus may partly account for our propensity to generatedynamical couplings with others.
 Social isolation has been recognized as a major risk factor for morbidity andmortality in humans for more than a quarter of a century. Although the focus ofresearch has been on objective social roles and health behavior, the brain is thekey organ for forming, monitoring, maintaining, repairing, and replacing salutaryconnections with others. Accordingly, population-based longitudinal researchindicates that perceived social isolation (loneliness) is a risk factor formorbidity and mortality independent of objective social isolation and healthbehavior. Human and animal investigations of neuroendocrine stress mechanismsthat may be involved suggest that (a) chronic social isolation increases theactivation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical axis, and (b) theseeffects are more dependent on the disruption of a social bond between asignificant pair than objective isolation per se. The relational factors andneuroendocrine, neurobiological, and genetic mechanisms that may contribute tothe association between perceived isolation and mortality are reviewed.
 Social neuroscience, often viewed as studying the neural foundations of socialcognition, has roots in multiple disciplines. This paper argues that it needs afirmer base in social psychology. First, we outline some major opportunities fromsocial psychology--the power of social context and social motives in shapinghuman behavior. Second, as the social cognition field moves away from studyingonly deliberate, explicit processes to studying also automatic, implicitprocesses, adopting a dual-process perspective, social neuroscience also lendsitself to both automatic and controlled processes. Finally, social neuroscienceis especially suited to study the efficiency and spontaneity of social judgments.All this brings social behavioral grounding to cognitive neuroscience. Among the implications for social neuroscience: Social cognition intrinsically evokesaffect, so social cognitive affective neuroscience glues together a variety offields in psychological and neurosciences.
 The present research explored the main factors able to influence the subjects'choices in the case of decisions and distinguish between high- and low-riskdecisions. Behavioral responses (Iowa Gambling Task [IGT]), meta-cognitivestrategy, and event-related potential (feedback-related negativity [FRN] andP300) effects were used as predictive markers of gambling behavior. Behavioralactivation system (BAS)-reward measure was applied to distinguish betweenhigh-BAS and low-BAS. It was found that higher-BAS opted in favor of theimmediate reward, with a concomitant dysfunctional metacognition of theirstrategy. Finally, a consistent "reward bias" affected the high-BAS performancereducing the P300 and FRN in response to unexpected (loss) events. The corticallocalization (sLORETA) of ERPs showed the contribution by distinct anterior andposterior areas.
 A host of research has attempted to explain why some believe in the supernatural and some do not. One suggested explanation for commonly held supernatural beliefsis that they are a by-product of theory of mind (ToM) processing. However, thisdoes not explain why skeptics with intact ToM processes do not believe. Weemployed fMRI to investigate activation differences in ToM-related braincircuitries between supernatural believers (N = 12) and skeptics (N = 11) whilethey watched 2D animations of geometric objects moving intentionally or randomly and rated the intentionality of the animations. The ToM-related circuitries inthe medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were localized by contrastingintention-rating-related and control-rating-related brain activation. Comparedwith the skeptics, the supernatural believers rated the random movements as more intentional and had stronger activation of the ToM-related circuitries during theanimation with random movement. The strength of the ToM-related activationcovaried with the intentionality ratings. These findings provide evidence thatdifferences in ToM-related activations are associated with supernaturalbelievers' tendency to interpret random phenomena in mental terms. Thus,differences in ToM processing may contribute to differences between believing andunbelieving.
 In this paper, we elaborate a theoretical position and report an empirical study on a specific form of interpersonal engagement: the propensity to identify withthe subjective orientation of another person. On the basis of a hypothesis thatindividuals with autism have a relative lack of this form of intersubjectiveconnectedness (Hobson, 1993, 2002), we predicted that children and adolescentswith autism would contrast with matched participants without autism (n=12 pergroup) in specific aspects of communication when someone requested them to "GetPete to do this" and demonstrated actions in Pete's absence. As predicted, onblind ratings of videotapes of participants' communication, those with autismachieved lower scores on four indices of identification that were selected apriori: emotional engagement, sharing experience in joint attention,communication of style, and shifting in communicative role. The two groups werealmost completely separate on a composite measure of identification. We consider the implications of these findings for typical and atypical development.
 The mentalizing network is atypically activated in autism and schizophreniaspectrum disorders. While these disorders are considered diagnosticallyindependent, expressions of both can co-occur in the same individual. We examinedthe concurrent effect of autism traits and psychosis proneness on the activity ofthe mentalizing network in 24 neurotypical adults while performing a socialcompetitive game. Activations were observed in the paracingulate cortex and theright temporoparietal junction (rTPJ). Autism traits and psychosis proneness did not modulate activity within the paracingulate or the dorsal component of therTPJ. However, diametric modulations of autism traits and psychosis pronenesswere observed in the posterior (rvpTPJ) and anterior (rvaTPJ) subdivisions of theventral rTPJ, which respectively constitute core regions within the mentalizingand attention-reorienting networks. Within the rvpTPJ, increasing autismtendencies decreased activity, and increasing psychosis proneness increasedactivity. This effect was reversed within the rvaTPJ. We suggest that thisresults from an interaction between regions responsible for higher level socialcognitive processing (rvpTPJ) and regions responsible for domain-generalattentional processes (rvaTPJ). The observed diametric modulation of autismtendencies and psychosis proneness of neuronal activity within the mentalizingnetwork highlights the importance of assessing both autism and psychosisexpressions within the individual.
 Stress has profound impacts on physiology, the brain, cognition and behaviour. Inresponse to stress, the brain initiates several neuromodulatory and endocrinesystems. This leads to the release of stress-sensitive mediators, includingneuromodulators, hormones and neuropeptides, which in turn feed back on the brainand thus alters cognition and behaviour. As the progress of sophisticatedcognitive neuroimaging techniques, cognitive neuroscientists have begun toelucidate the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying detrimental andbeneficial effects of stress on emotion, cognition and behaviour in the humanbrain. Stress-related neuromodulations occur at various stages of informationprocessing, from the initial vigilance, attention, executive functions, learning and memory, and emotion. We reviewed recent advances in cognitive neuroscience ofstress and proposed a multidimensional model of stress for better understandinghow stress-sensitive neuromodulatory and endocrine systems interplay to impactthe brain, cognition and behaviour in humans.
 OBJECTIVES: Limited information is available on physician-related factorsinfluencing therapeutic inertia (TI) in multiple sclerosis (MS). Our aim was toevaluate whether physicians' risk preferences are associated with TI in MS care, by applying concepts from behavioral economics. DESIGN: In this cross-sectionalstudy, participants answered questions regarding the management of 20 MS casescenarios, completed 3 surveys, and 4 experimental paradigms based on behavioral economics. Surveys and experiments included standardized measures of aversionambiguity in financial and health domains, physicians' reactions to uncertaintyin patient care, and questions related to risk preferences in different domains. The primary outcome was TI when physicians faced a need for escalating therapybased on clinical (new relapse) and magnetic resonance imaging activity whilepatients were on a disease-modifying agent. RESULTS: Of 161 neurologists who wereinvited to participate in the project, 136 cooperated with the study (cooperationrate 84.5%) and 96 completed the survey (response rate: 60%). TI was present in68.8% of participants. Similar results were observed for definitions of TI based on modified Rio or clinical progression. Aversion to ambiguity was associatedwith higher prevalence of TI (86.4% with high aversion to ambiguity vs. 63.5%with lower or no aversion to ambiguity; p = 0.042). In multivariate analyses,high aversion to ambiguity was the strongest predictor of TI (OR 7.39; 95%CI1.40-38.9), followed by low tolerance to uncertainty (OR 3.47; 95%CI 1.18-10.2). CONCLUSION: TI is a common phenomenon affecting nearly 7 out of 10 physicianscaring for MS patients. Higher prevalence of TI was associated with physician'sstrong aversion to ambiguity and low tolerance of uncertainty.
 It has previously been shown that observing an action made by a human, but not bya robot, interferes with executed actions (Kilner, Paulignan, & Blakemore, 2003).Here, we investigated what aspect of human movement causes this interferenceeffect. Subjects made arm movements while observing a video of either a humanmaking an arm movement or a ball moving across the screen. Both human and ballvideos contained either biological (minimum jerk) or non-biological (constantvelocity) movements. The executed and observed arm movements were eithercongruent (same direction) or incongruent (tangential direction) with each other.The results showed that observed movements are processed differently according towhether they are made by a human or a ball. For the ball videos, both biological and non-biological incongruent movements interfered with executed arm movements. In contrast, for the human videos, the velocity profile of the movement was thecritical factor: only incongruent, biological human movements interfered withexecuted arm movements. We propose that the interference effect could be dueeither to the information the brain has about different types of movement stimulior to the impact of prior experience with different types of form and motion.
 Taking another person's viewpoint and making sense of their actions are keyprocesses that guide social behavior. Previous neuroimaging investigations havelargely studied these processes separately. The current study used functionalmagnetic resonance imaging to examine how the brain incorporates another person'sviewpoint and actions into visual perspective judgments. Participants made aleft-right judgment about the location of a target object from their own(egocentric) or an actor's visual perspective (altercentric). Actor locationvaried around a table and the actor was either reaching or not reaching for thetarget object. Analyses examined brain regions engaged in the egocentric andaltercentric tasks, brain regions where response magnitude tracked theorientation of the actor in the scene and brain regions sensitive to the actionperformed by the actor. The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response indorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) was sensitive to actor orientation in thealtercentric task, whereas the response in right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) wassensitive to actor orientation in the egocentric task. Thus, dmPFC and right IFG may play distinct but complementary roles in visual perspective taking (VPT).Observation of a reaching actor compared to a non-reaching actor yieldedactivation in lateral occipitotemporal cortex, regardless of task, showing thatthese regions are sensitive to body posture independent of social context. Byconsidering how an observed actor's location and action influence the neuralbases of visual perspective judgments, the current study supports the view thatmultiple neurocognitive "routes" operate during VPT.
 In the dictator game, a proposer can share a certain amount of money betweenhimself or herself and a receiver, who has no opportunity of influencing theoffer. Rational choice theory predicts that dictators keep all money forthemselves. But people often are offering money to receivers, despite theiropportunity to maximize their own profit and therefore showing altruisticbehavior. In this study, we investigated the influence of the altruism of thedictator, the anonymity of the decision and the income of the receiver on theoffer made by a dictator. Additionally, we were interested in the influence ofmidfrontal theta activity prior to the offer, indicating the upcoming decision.The height of the offer made by the dictator was dependent on all variablesinvestigated: Altruism of the dictator led to higher offers and income of thereceiver led to higher offer the poorer the receivers are. The anonymity of thedecision had two effects, depending on the altruism of the dictator, with higher offers for highly altruistic dictators, when they were not observed, and loweroffers for less altruistic dictators in this condition. Finally, midfrontal thetaactivity predicts upcoming fair offers, maybe indicating altruistic motivation orempathy on physiological basis.
 Paul MacLean has investigated integrated brain functioning through selected brainlesions in animals that disturb circuits necessary for complex behaviors, such associal displays. MacLean is unique in his comparative neurobehavioral approachthat emphasizes the evolutionary origins of parenting and social behaviors andthe implications of brain changes in the evolution from reptiles (socialdisplays) to mammals (nursing, audiovocal communication, play) to man(self-awareness, intentionality, social context) that link affect and cognition. Subjectively, how "looking with feeling toward others," the basic element inempathy, evolved has been a central concern of his. Neuroimaging studies ofsocial cognition, mother-infant communication, moral behavior, forgiveness, andtrust are consistent with particular brain systems being activated in cooperativesocial behaviors. The identification of mirror neurons is pertinent to MacLean's model of isopraxis and studies of thalamocortical resonances may be pertinent to his neurobehavioral models. Studies of behavioral phenotypes in humanneurodevelopmental disorders are consistent with MacLean's model of braincircuits being linked to complex behaviors during development. In autisticdisorder, the behavioral phenotype involves disrupted social communication,deviant imaginative play, and motor stereotypies. In Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS), self-injury occurs in individuals with normal sensory systems intact who require and request physical restraint to prevent self-injury; they ask for assistancefrom others to prevent them from harming themselves. Autism involves the lack of subjective awareness of others intentions and LNS involves a failure inself-regulation and self-control of self-injurious behavior. MacLean's modelslaid the groundwork for studies focused on understanding brain functioning inthese conditions.
 Moral judgment depends critically on theory of mind (ToM), reasoning about mentalstates such as beliefs and intentions. People assign blame for failed attempts toharm and offer forgiveness in the case of accidents. Here we use fMRI toinvestigate the role of ToM in moral judgment of harmful vs. helpful actions. Is ToM deployed differently for judgments of blame vs. praise? Participantsevaluated agents who produced a harmful, helpful, or neutral outcome, based on a harmful, helpful, or neutral intention; participants made blame and praisejudgments. In the right temporo-parietal junction (right TPJ), and, to a lesserextent, the left TPJ and medial prefrontal cortex, the neural response reflected an interaction between belief and outcome factors, for both blame and praisejudgments: The response in these regions was highest when participants delivered a negative moral judgment, i.e., assigned blame or withheld praise, based solely on the agent's intent (attempted harm, accidental help). These results showenhanced attention to mental states for negative moral verdicts based exclusivelyon mental state information.
 How do epigenetic modifications change across species and how do thesemodifications affect evolution? These are fundamental questions at the forefront of our evolutionary epigenomic understanding. Our previous work investigatedhuman and chimpanzee brain methylomes, but it was limited by the lack of outgroupdata which is critical for comparative (epi)genomic studies. Here, we comparedwhole genome DNA methylation maps from brains of humans, chimpanzees and alsorhesus macaques (outgroup) to elucidate DNA methylation changes during humanbrain evolution. Moreover, we validated that our approach is highly robust byfurther examining 38 human-specific DMRs using targeted deep genomic andbisulfite sequencing in an independent panel of 37 individuals from five primate species. Our unbiased genome-scan identified human brain differentiallymethylated regions (DMRs), irrespective of their associations with annotatedgenes. Remarkably, over half of the newly identified DMRs locate in intergenicregions or gene bodies. Nevertheless, their regulatory potential is on par withthose of promoter DMRs. An intriguing observation is that DMRs are enriched inactive chromatin loops, suggesting human-specific evolutionary remodeling at ahigher-order chromatin structure. These findings indicate that there issubstantial reprogramming of epigenomic landscapes during human brain evolutioninvolving noncoding regions.
 Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) is a perceptual condition in whichspecific visual and auditory stimuli consistently trigger tingling sensations on the scalp and neck, sometimes spreading to the back and limbs. These triggeringstimuli are often social, almost intimate, in nature (e.g., hearing whispering,or watching someone brush her hair), and often elicit a calm and positiveemotional state. Surprisingly, despite its prevalence in the general population, no published study has examined the neural underpinnings of ASMR. In the current study, the default mode network (DMN) of 11 individuals with ASMR was contrasted to that of 11 matched controls. The results indicated that the DMN of individualswith ASMR showed significantly less functional connectivity than that ofcontrols. The DMN of individuals with ASMR also demonstrated increasedconnectivity between regions in the occipital, frontal, and temporal cortices,suggesting that ASMR was associated with a blending of multiple resting-statenetworks. This atypical functional connectivity likely influences the uniquesensory-emotional experiences associated with ASMR.
 INTRODUCTION: During social interactions, our own physiological responsesinfluence those of others. Synchronization of physiological (and behavioural)responses can facilitate emotional understanding and group coherence throughinter-subjectivity. Here we investigate if observing cues indicating a change in another's body temperature results in a corresponding temperature change in theobserver. METHODS: Thirty-six healthy participants (age; 22.9+/-3.1 yrs) eachobserved, then rated, eight purpose-made videos (3 min duration) that depictedactors with either their right or left hand in visibly warm (warm videos) or coldwater (cold videos). Four control videos with the actors' hand in front of thewater were also shown. Temperature of participant observers' right and left handswas concurrently measured using a thermistor within a Wheatstone bridge with atheoretical temperature sensitivity of <0.0001 degrees C. Temperature data wereanalysed in a repeated measures ANOVA (temperature x actor's hand x observer'shand). RESULTS: Participants rated the videos showing hands immersed in coldwater as being significantly cooler than hands immersed in warm water, F(1,34) = 256.67, p<0.001. Participants' own hands also showed a significanttemperature-dependent effect: hands were significantly colder when observing coldvs. warm videos F(1,34) = 13.83, p = 0.001 with post-hoc t-test demonstrating asignificant reduction in participants' own left (t(35) = -3.54, p = 0.001) andright (t(35) = -2.33, p = 0.026) hand temperature during observation of coldvideos but no change to warm videos (p>0.1). There was however no evidence ofleft-right mirroring of these temperature effects p>0.1). Sensitivity totemperature contagion was also predicted by inter-individual differences inself-report empathy. CONCLUSIONS: We illustrate physiological contagion oftemperature in healthy individuals, suggesting that empathetic understanding for primary low-level physiological challenges (as well as more complex emotions) aregrounded in somatic simulation.
 This neuroimaging study compares brain activation during causal attribution tothree different attribution loci (i.e., self, another person, and situation)across a typical population without (N = 20) or with subclinical autism spectrum symptoms (N = 18) and a clinical population with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; N= 11). While they underwent fMRI, all participants read short sentencesdescribing positive and negative behaviors and thoughts of another persondirected toward the participant (i.e., "you"). Participants were then asked toattribute these behaviors to themselves, the other person, or the situation.Behavioral measures revealed self-serving attributions (i.e., attributingpositive events to the self, while attributing negative events externally fromthe self) in all three participant groups. Neural measures revealed a great deal of shared activation across the three attribution loci and across the threeparticipant groups in the temporo-parietal junction, the posterior superiorsulcus, and the precuneus. Comparison between groups revealed more widespreadactivation in both subclinical and clinical ASD participants, which may beindicative of the extraneural resources these participants invest to compensatetheir impairments.
 Cognitive neuroscience has made considerable progress in understanding theinvolvement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in social cognition and moraljudgment. Accumulating evidence suggests that representations within the lateral PFC enable people to orchestrate their thoughts and actions in concert with theirintentions to support goal-directed social behavior. Despite the pivotal role of this region in guiding social interactions, remarkably little is known about the functional organization and forms of social knowledge mediated by the lateralPFC. Here, we review recent theoretical developments in evolutionary psychologyand emerging evidence from the social and decision neuroscience literaturesdemonstrating the importance of the lateral PFC for orchestrating behavior on thebasis of evolutionarily adaptive social norms for obligatory, prohibited, andpermissible courses of action.

 Humans and chimpanzees demonstrate numerous cognitive specializations forprocessing faces, but comparative studies with monkeys suggest that these may be the result of recent evolutionary adaptations. The present study utilized thenovel approach of face space, a powerful theoretical framework used to understandthe representation of face identity in humans, to further explore speciesdifferences in face processing. According to the theory, faces are represented byvectors in a multidimensional space, the centre of which is defined by an averageface. Each dimension codes features important for describing a face's identity,and vector length codes the feature's distinctiveness. Chimpanzees and rhesusmonkeys discriminated male and female conspecifics' faces, rated by humans fortheir distinctiveness, using a computerized task. Multidimensional scalinganalyses showed that the organization of face space was similar between humansand chimpanzees. Distinctive faces had the longest vectors and were the easiestfor chimpanzees to discriminate. In contrast, distinctiveness did not correlatewith the performance of rhesus monkeys. The feature dimensions for each species' face space were visualized and described using morphing techniques. These resultsconfirm species differences in the perceptual representation of conspecificfaces, which are discussed within an evolutionary framework.
 Suprasegmental acoustic patterns in speech can convey meaningful information and affect listeners' interpretation in various ways, including through systematicanalog mapping of message-relevant information onto prosody. We examined whether the effect of analog acoustic variation is governed by the acoustic propertiesthemselves. For example, fast speech may always prime the concept of speed or afaster response. Alternatively, the effect may be modulated by thecontext-dependent interpretation of those properties; the effect of rate maydepend on how listeners construe its meaning in the immediate linguistic orcommunicative context. In two experiments, participants read short scenarios thatimplied, or did not imply, urgency. Scenarios were followed by recordedinstructions, spoken at varying rates. The results show that speech rate had aneffect on listeners' response speed; however, this effect was modulated bydiscourse context. Speech rate affected response speed following contexts thatemphasized speed, but not without such contextual information.
 The current study aimed to identify atypical neurophysiological activityassociated with deficient affective processing in individuals with highcallous-unemotional traits (CU). Fifty-six participants (M age = 20.52; 46% male)divided in two groups, differentiated on levels of CU traits, were invited toparticipate in the experimental phase of the study. Medial prefrontal cortexactivity, measured with functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy, and facialelectro-myography activity were recorded during videos depicting violent, comedy and neutral scenes. Individuals high on CU traits showed similar medialprefrontal cortex oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO(2)) activity to positive andnegative films, while the pre-frontal cortical responses of low CU individualswere more pronounced to positive than negative materials. High CU participantsalso showed reduced facial electromyography at the corrugator muscle in response to violent films, which was not differentiated from their responses to comedyfilms. These findings suggest that individuals high on CU traits show reduced butnot absent (i.e., flat) affect to emotional material. Deficits in processingpositive and negative valent material, measured with differentneuro-physiological modalities, might be essential to understand CU traits.
 The human brain is inherently able to understand the world in moral ways,endowing most of us with an intuitive sense of fairness, concern for others, and observance of cultural norms. We have argued that this moral sensitivity ability depends on a sophisticated integration of cognitive, emotional, and motivational mechanisms, which are modulated by individual experience in different culturalmilieus. Different lines of investigation on agency and morality have pointed to overlapping neural systems. Therefore, understanding the relationships betweenmorality and agency may provide key insights into the mechanisms underlying humanbehavior in several clinical and societal settings. We used functional MRI toinvestigate the contribution of agency and of specific moral emotions to brainactivation using action scripts. Results showed that emotionally neutral agencyrecruited neural networks previously associated with agency, intentionality andmoral cognition, encompassing ventral and subgenual sectors of the medialprefrontal cortex (PFC), insula, anterior temporal cortex and superior temporalsulcus (STS). Compared to emotionally neutral agency, different categories ofmoral emotions led to distinct activation patterns: (1) prosocial emotions(guilt, embarrassment, compassion) activated the anterior medial PFC and STS,with (2) empathic emotions (guilt and compassion) additionally recruiting themesolimbic pathway; (3) other-critical emotions (disgust and indignation) wereassociated with activation of the amygdala-parahippocampal and fusiform areas.These findings indicate that agency related to norm-abiding social behaviors ofemotionally neutral scripts share neural substrates both with the "default mode" of brain function and with the moral sensitivity network. Additional activationin specific components of this network is elicited by different classes of moral emotions, in agreement with recent integrative models of moral cognition andemotion.
 A recent framework inspired by phenomenological philosophy, dynamical systemstheory, embodied cognition and robotics has proposed the interactive brainhypothesis (IBH). Whereas mainstream social neuroscience views social cognitionas arising solely from events in the brain, the IBH argues that social cognition requires, in addition, causal relations between the brain and the socialenvironment. We discuss, in turn, the foundational claims for the IBH in itsstrongest form; classical views of cognition that can be raised against the IBH; a defence of the IBH in the light of these arguments; and a response to this. Ourgoal is to initiate a dialogue between cognitive neuroscience and enactive views of social cognition. We conclude by suggesting some new directions and emphasesthat social neuroscience might take.
 Despite evidence that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity is related tosocial exclusion, rejection and unfairness, evidence that medial frontalnegativity (MFN), which has its source in the ACC, reflects these constructsremains unforthcoming. In the present study, subjects participated as recipients in an ultimatum game, while we recorded their electro-encephalogram (EEG).Participants responded to fair and unfair offers from different human proposers. In addition, participants rated themselves on a measure evaluating their concern for fairness. Results showed that MFN amplitude was more pronounced for unfairoffers compared to fair offers. Moreover, this effect was shown to be mostpronounced for subjects with high concerns for fairness. Our findings suggestthat the MFN not only reflects whether outcomes match expectations, but alsoreflects whether the process by which these outcomes came about matches a social or even a moral norm. In addition, the present results suggest that people inbargaining situations are not only concerned with their own outcomes, but arealso concerned with the fairness of the process that resulted in these outcomes.
 Vibration applied to muscle tendons induces an illusory perception of movement byactivating spindle receptors and Ia afferent fibers. While neural structuressupporting such illusions are quite defined, functional and psychophysicalcorrelates of their perception have not been deeply investigated. The authorsaimed at exploring subjective perception of illusory movements thanks to arepeated-stimulation multimodal approach. The integrated analysis ofelectroencephalography, source data (standardized low-resolution brainelectromagnetic tomography-sLORETA), and psychophysical evaluation pointed at theactivation of a frontoparietal sensorimotor network, with prefrontal-medialregions mainly involved in supporting the awareness for illusory movements.Further, illusions showed consistency in terms of presence, vividness, andduration. Finally, superior parietal structures seemed to play an important role in self-attribution of agency and ownership during such experiences.
 In everyday life causal attribution is important in order to structure thecomplex world, provide explanations for events and to understand why ourenvironment interacts with us in a particular way. This study used functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 30 healthy subjects to separate the neuralcorrelates of self vs. external responsibility for social events and explore the neural basis of self-serving attributions (internal attributions of positiveevents and external attributions of negative events). We presented shortsentences describing positive and negative social events and asked participantsto imagine the event, to decide the main cause and assign it to one of thecategories (internal vs. external). FMRI data were analyzed using a 2 x 2factorial design with the factors emotional valence and attribution. Internalcompared to external attribution revealed activations along the righttemporoparietal junction (TPJ). The reverse contrast showed a left lateralizednetwork mainly involving the TPJ, the precuneus and the superior/medial frontalgyrus. These results confirmed the involvement of a fronto-temporoparietalnetwork in differentiating self and external responsibility. Analysis of theself-serving bias yielded activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate and in the dorsal striatum, suggesting a rewarding value of these attributions.
 Dominance hierarchies are an important aspect of group-living as they determineindividual access to resources. The existence of dominance ranks in access tospace has not been described in socially monogamous, communally nesting prairievoles (Microtus ochrogaster). Here, we tested whether dominance could be assessedusing the tube test. We also tested whether dominance related to alcohol intake, similar to what has been demonstrated in nonmonogamous species. Same-sex pairs ofunfamiliar peers were tested in a series of three trials of the tube test, thenpaired and allowed individual access to alcohol and water for 4 days, and thentested again in the tube test. For all pairs, the same subjects won the majority of trials before and after alcohol drinking. The number of wins negativelycorrelated with alcohol intake on the first day of drinking and positivelycorrelated with levels of Fos in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus following the tube test in a separate group of voles. Dominance was not relatedto Fos levels in other brain regions examined. Together, these results indicatethat prairie voles quickly establish stable dominance ranks through a processpossibly involving the hypothalamus and suggest that dominance is linked toalcohol drinking.
 Most of the research on Bayesian reasoning aims to answer theoretical questionsabout the extent to which people are able to update their beliefs according toBayes' Theorem, about the evolutionary nature of Bayesian inference, or about therole of cognitive abilities in Bayesian inference. Few studies aim to answerpractical, mainly health-related questions, such as, "What does it mean to have apositive test in a context of cancer screening?" or "What is the best way tocommunicate a medical test result so a patient will understand it?". This type ofresearch aims to translate empirical findings into effective ways of providingrisk information. In addition, the applied research often adopts the paradigmsand methods of the theoretically-motivated research. But sometimes it works theother way around, and the theoretical research borrows the importance of thepractical question in the medical context. The study of Bayesian reasoning isrelevant to risk communication in that, to be as useful as possible, appliedresearch should employ specifically tailored methods and contexts specific to therecipients of the risk information. In this paper, we concentrate on thecommunication of the result of medical tests and outline the epidemiological and test parameters that affect the predictive power of a test-whether it is correct or not. Building on this, we draw up recommendations for better practice toconvey the results of medical tests that could inform health policy makers (What are the drawbacks of mass screenings?), be used by health practitioners and, inturn, help patients to make better and more informed decisions.
 Emotion regulation is a critical aspect of children's social development, yet fewstudies have examined the brain mechanisms involved in its development.Theoretical accounts have conceptualized emotion regulation as relying onprefrontal control of limbic regions, specifying the anterior cingulate cortex(ACC) as a key brain region. Functional magnetic resonance imaging in 5- to11-year-olds during emotion regulation and processing of emotionally expressivefaces revealed that older children preferentially recruited the more dorsal"cognitive" areas of the ACC, while younger children preferentially engaged themore ventral "emotional" areas. Additionally, children with more fearfultemperaments exhibited more ventral ACC activity while less fearful childrenexhibited increased activity in the dorsal ACC. These findings provide insightinto a potential neurobiological mechanism underlying well-documented behavioral and cognitive changes from more emotional to more cognitive regulatory strategieswith increasing age, as well as individual differences in this developmentalprocess as a function of temperament. Our results hold important implications forour understanding of normal development and should also help to inform ourunderstanding and management of emotional disorders.
 The cognitive and neural mechanisms leading to deception were studied by theevent-related brain potential (ERP) technique. In a simulated deception situationwith graded monetary incentives, participants made a decision to lie or betruthful in each trial and held their response until a delayed imperative signal was presented. Spatiotemporal principal component analysis (PCA) and sourceanalysis revealed that brain activities dominant in the left lateral frontal areaapproximately 800-1,000 ms post-stimulus and over the central-frontal-parietaland right frontal areas after 1,300 ms were significantly more negative in thedeceptive condition than in the truthful condition. These results suggest thattwo serial cognitive processes, decision making and response preparation, arerelated to deliberate deception.
 Although the processes that underlie sharing others' emotions (empathy) andunderstanding others' mental states (mentalizing, Theory of Mind) have receivedincreasing attention, it is yet unclear how they relate to each other. Forinstance, are people who strongly empathize with others also more proficient inmentalizing? And (how) do the neural networks supporting empathy and mentalizing interact? Assessing both functions simultaneously in a large sample (N = 178), weshow that people's capacities to empathize and mentalize are independent, both ona behavioral and neural level. Thus, strong empathizers are not necessarilyproficient mentalizers, arguing against a general capacity of socialunderstanding. Second, we applied dynamic causal modeling to investigate how the neural networks underlying empathy and mentalizing are orchestrated innaturalistic social settings. Results reveal that in highly emotional situations,empathic sharing can inhibit mentalizing-related activity and thereby harmmentalizing performance. Taken together, our findings speak against a unitaryconstruct of social understanding and suggest flexible interplay of distinctsocial functions.
 Social interactions come with the fundamental problem of trying to understandothers' mental and affective states while under the overpowering influence ofone's own concurrent thoughts and feelings. The ability to distinguish betweensimultaneous representations of others' current experiences as well as our own iscrucial to navigate our complex social environments successfully. Thedevelopmental building blocks of this ability and how this is given rise to byfunctional and structural brain development remains poorly understood. In thisreview, I outline some of the key findings on the role of self-other distinction in understanding others' mental as well as emotional states in children andadults. I will begin by clarifying the crucial role for self-other distinction inavoiding egocentric attributions of one's own cognitive as well as affectivestates to others in adults and outline the underlying neural circuitry inovercoming such egocentricity. This will provide the basis for a discussion ofthe emergence of self-other distinction in early childhood as well asdevelopmental changes therein throughout childhood and into adulthood. I willdemonstrate that self-other distinction of cognitive and emotional states isalready dissociable early in development. Concomitantly, I will show thatprocesses of self-other distinction in cognitive and affective domains rely onadjacent but distinct neural circuitry each with unique connectivity profiles,presumably related to the nature of the distinction that needs to be made.
 Recent analyses have suggested that the size and proportions of the precuneus areremarkably variable among adult humans, representing a major source ofgeometrical difference in midsagittal brain morphology. The same area alsorepresents the main midsagittal brain difference between humans and chimpanzees, being more expanded in our species. Enlargement of the upper parietal surface is a specific feature of Homo sapiens, when compared with other fossil hominids,suggesting the involvement of these cortical areas in recent modern humanevolution. Here, we provide a survey on midsagittal brain morphology byinvestigating whether precuneus size represents the largest component of variancewithin a larger and racially diverse sample of 265 adult humans. Additionally, weinvestigate the relationship between precuneus shape variation and foldingpatterns. Precuneus proportions are confirmed to be a major source of human brainvariation even when racial variability is considered. Larger precuneus size isassociated with additional precuneal gyri, generally in its anterior district.Spatial variation is most pronounced in the dorsal areas, with no apparentdifferences between hemispheres, between sexes, or among different racial groups.These dorsal areas integrate somatic and visual information together with thelateral elements of the parietal cortex, representing a crucial node forself-centered mental imagery. The histological basis and functional significance of this intra-specific variation in the upper precuneus remains to be evaluated.
 Is the visual analysis of human actions modulated by the emotional content ofthose actions? This question is motivated by a consideration of theneuroanatomical connections between visual and emotional areas. Specifically, thesuperior temporal sulcus (STS), known to play a critical role in the visualdetection of action, is extensively interconnected with the amygdala, a centerfor emotion processing. To the extent that amygdala activity influences STSactivity, one would expect to find systematic differences in the visual detectionof emotional actions. A series of psychophysical studies tested this prediction. Experiment 1 identified point-light walker movies that convincingly depicted fivedifferent emotional states: happiness, sadness, neutral, anger, and fear. InExperiment 2, participants performed a walker detection task with these movies.Detection performance was systematically modulated by the emotional content ofthe gaits. Participants demonstrated the greatest visual sensitivity to angrywalkers. The results of Experiment 3 suggest that local velocity cues to angermay account for high false alarm rates to the presence of angry gaits. Theseresults support the hypothesis that the visual analysis of human action dependsupon emotion processes.
 The proceedings of the workshop synthesize the experimental, preclinical, andclinical data suggesting that the cerebellum, basal ganglia (BG), and theirconnections play an important role in pathophysiology of various movementdisorders (like Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonian syndromes) orneurodevelopmental disorders (like autism). The contributions from individualdistinguished speakers cover the neuroanatomical research of complex networks,neuroimaging data showing that the cerebellum and BG are connected to a widerange of other central nervous system structures involved in movement control.Especially, the cerebellum plays a more complex role in how the brain functionsthan previously thought.
 The "framing effect" (FE) describes the phenomenon whereby human choices aresusceptible to the way they are presented rather than objective information. The present study extends common decision-making paradigms with frame variation byincluding inhibitory control, operationalized as vagally mediated heart ratevariability (HRV) at rest and motor response inhibition during a stop-signal task(SST). We hypothesized that inhibitory control is inversely associated withsusceptibility to framing effects. Forty adult volunteers performed arisky-choice framing task in which identical information about wins and losseswas presented using loss or gain frames. As predicted, there was an inverseassociation between HRV and framing effects, accounting for 23% of the variancein framing effects. Inhibitory control as indexed by performance in the SST wasnot associated with framing effects. These results are discussed in terms of the role of inhibitory processes (as indicated by vagal activity) for decision-makingprocesses.
 Being able to infer the thoughts, feelings and intentions of those around us isindispensable in order to function in a social world. Despite growing interest insocial cognition and its neural underpinnings, the factors that contribute tosuccessful mental state attribution remain unclear. Current knowledge is limited because the most widely used tasks suffer from two main constraints: (i) Theyfail to capture individual variability due to ceiling effects and (ii) they usehighly simplistic, often artificial stimuli inapt to mirror real-worldsocio-cognitive demands. In the present study, we address these problems byemploying complex depictions of naturalistic social interactions that vary inboth valence (positive vs negative) and ambiguity (high vs low). Thirty-eighthealthy participants (20 female) made mental state judgments while brainresponses were obtained using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).Accuracy varied based on valence and ambiguity conditions and women were moreaccurate than men with highly ambiguous social stimuli. Activity of theorbitofrontal cortex predicted performance in the high ambiguity condition. Theresults shed light on subtle differences in mentalizing abilities and associated neural activity.
 The theory of integrative levels provides a general description of the evolution of matter through successive orders of complexity and integration. Along itsdevelopment, material forms pass through different levels of organization, suchas physical, chemical, biological or sociological. The appearance of novelstructures and dynamics during this process of development of matter in complexsystems has been called emergence. Social neuroscience (SN), an interdisciplinaryfield that aims to investigate the biological mechanisms that underlie socialstructures, processes, and behavior and the influences between social andbiological levels of organization, has affirmed the necessity for includingsocial context as an essential element to understand the human behavior. To dothis, SN proposes a multilevel integrative approach by means of three principles:multiple determinism, nonadditive determinism and reciprocal determinism. Thesetheoretical principles seem to share the basic tenets of the theory ofintegrative levels but, in this paper, we aim to reveal the differences amongboth doctrines. First, SN asserts that combination of neural and social variablescan produce emergent phenomena that would not be predictable from aneuroscientific or social psychological analysis alone; SN also suggests that to achieve a complete understanding of social structures we should use anintegrative analysis that encompasses levels of organization ranging from thegenetic level to the social one; finally, SN establishes that there can be mutualinfluences between biological and social factors in determining behavior,accepting, therefore, a double influence, upward from biology to social level,and downward, from social level to biology. In contrast, following the theory of integrative levels, emergent phenomena are not produced by the combination ofvariables from two levels, but by the increment of complexity at one level. Inaddition, the social behavior and structures might be contemplated not as theresult of mixing or summing social and biological influences, but as emergentphenomena that should be described with its own laws. Finally, following theintegrative levels view, influences upward, from biology to social level, anddownward, from social level to biology, might not be equivalent, since thebottom-up processes are emergent and the downward causation (DC) is not.
 Social expectations play a critical role in everyday decision-making. However,their precise neuro-computational role in the decision process remains unknown.Here we adopt a decision neuroscience framework by combining methods and theoriesfrom psychology, economics and neuroscience to outline a novel,expectation-based, computational model of social preferences. Results demonstratethat this model outperforms the standard inequity-aversion model in explainingdecision behavior in a social interactive bargaining task. This is supported byfMRI findings showing that the tracking of social expectation violations isprocessed by anterior cingulate cortex, extending previous computationalconceptualizations of this region to the social domain. This study demonstratesthe usefulness of this interdisciplinary approach in better characterizing thepsychological processes that underlie social interactive decision-making.
 Efficient implicit emotion regulation processes, which run without awareness, areimportant for human well-being. In this study, to investigate the influence ofimplicit emotion regulation on psychological and electrophysiological responsesto gains and losses, participants were required to select between two Chinesefour-character idioms to match the meaning of the third one before they performeda monetary gambling task. According to whether their meanings were related toemotion regulation, the idioms fell into two categories. Event-related potentialsand self-rating emotional experiences to outcome feedback were recorded duringthe task. Priming emotion regulation reduced subjective emotional experience toboth gains and losses and the amplitudes of the feedback-related negativity,while the P3 component was not influenced. According to these results, we suggestthat the application of implicit emotion regulation effectively modulated thesubjective emotional experience and the motivational salience of current outcomeswithout the cost of cognitive resources. This study implicates the potentialsignificance of implicit emotion regulation in decision-making processes.
 BACKGROUND: Various affective disorders are linked with enhanced processing ofunpleasant stimuli. However, this link is likely a result of the dominantnegative mood derived from the disorder, rather than a result of the disorderitself. Additionally, little is currently known about the influence of mood onthe susceptibility to emotional events in healthy populations. METHOD:Event-Related Potentials (ERP) were recorded for pleasant, neutral and unpleasantpictures while subjects performed an emotional/neutral picture classificationtask during positive, neutral, or negative mood induced by instrumental Chinesemusic. RESULTS: Late Positive Potential (LPP) amplitudes were positively related to the affective arousal of pictures. The emotional responding to unpleasantpictures, indicated by the unpleasant-neutral differences in LPPs, was enhancedduring negative compared to neutral and positive moods in the entire LPP timewindow (600-1000 ms). The magnitude of this enhancement was larger withincreasing self-reported negative mood. In contrast, this responding was reduced during positive compared to neutral mood in the 800-1000 ms interval.Additionally, LPP reactions to pleasant stimuli were similar across positive,neutral and negative moods except those in the 800-900 ms interval. IMPLICATIONS:Negative mood intensifies the humans' susceptibility to unpleasant events inhealthy individuals. In contrast, music-induced happy mood is effective inreducing the susceptibility to these events. Practical implications of thesefindings were discussed.
 ABSTRACT Perception and understanding of dispositions and intentions of othersthrough their actions are of immense importance for adaptive daily-life behavior and social communication. Here we ask whether, and, if so, how this ability isimpaired in adolescents who were born premature and suffer early periventricular damage, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) that affects brain connectivity. Thevisual event arrangement (EA) task was administered to PVL patients and twocontrol groups, premature-born and term-born adolescents without brainabnormalities on a magnetic resonance imaging scan. Performance on the EA taskwas significantly lower in PVL patients as compared with controls. No difference was found between premature-born participants without lesions and term-borncontrols. Performance on the EA task was inversely related to the volumetricextent of lesions in the parieto-occipital regions of both hemispheres and, inparticular, to the right temporal periventricular lesions. Whereas our earlierwork reveals that compromised visual processing of biological motion, impairmentsin visual navigation, and other visual-perceptual disabilities in PVL patientsare associated with parieto-occipital lesions, difficulties in the visual EA tasksolely are specifically linked to the right temporal periventricular lesions. Forthe first time, we show that the severity of the right temporal PVL can serve as a predictor of the ability for perception and understanding of others' actions.We assume that impairments in this ability in PVL patients are caused bydisrupted brain connectivity to the right temporal cortex, a key node of thesocial brain.
 Physiological resonance between individuals is considered fundamental to thebiological capacity for empathy. Observers of pain and distress commonly exhibit increases in reported distress, autonomic arousal, facial mimicry, andoverlapping neural activity. An important, unstudied question is whetherphysiological stress can also resonate. Physiological stress is operationalizedas activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) andsympatho-adrenomedullary (SAM) axes. People often report an aversive stateresulting from the stress of another, but this could be conveyed throughresonating arousal or distress, without activating the physiological stressresponse. Physiological stress is particularly important to examine since itcommonly occurs chronically, with known negative effects on health. Salivarycortisol and salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) were measured in both speakers andobservers during a modified Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) to assess activation of the HPA and SAM axes (respectively). Cortisol (but not sAA) responsesresonated between speakers and observers. The cortisol response of observersincreased with trait empathy and was not related to the speaker's subjective fearor distress. This study provides a novel method for examining physiologicalresonance, and indicates that we can indeed catch another's physiological stress,suggesting a specific health risk for those in the social network of stressedindividuals.
 Deficits in eye contact have been a hallmark of autism since the condition'sinitial description. They are cited widely as a diagnostic feature and figureprominently in clinical instruments; however, the early onset of these deficitshas not been known. Here we show in a prospective longitudinal study that infantslater diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) exhibit mean decline in eyefixation from 2 to 6 months of age, a pattern not observed in infants who do not develop ASD. These observations mark the earliest known indicators of socialdisability in infancy, but also falsify a prior hypothesis: in the first monthsof life, this basic mechanism of social adaptive action--eye looking--is notimmediately diminished in infants later diagnosed with ASD; instead, eye looking appears to begin at normative levels prior to decline. The timing of declinehighlights a narrow developmental window and reveals the early derailment ofprocesses that would otherwise have a key role in canalizing typical socialdevelopment. Finally, the observation of this decline in eye fixation--ratherthan outright absence--offers a promising opportunity for early intervention thatcould build on the apparent preservation of mechanisms subserving reflexiveinitial orientation towards the eyes.
 Empathy refers to our ability to recognize and share emotions by another humanbeing. Impairment may underlie many of the emotional deficits commonly associatedwith a range of neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. The prefrontalcortex (PFC) has long been implicated in these processes, but the specificcontribution of subregions of the PFC remain unclear. Studies regarding the role of subregions of the prefrontal cortex such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex(vmPFC)-in facial emotion recognition have yielded inconsistent results. Thepresent study aimed to investigate the capacity to recognize nonverbal emotional facial expressions in a group of patients with the following: (a) perfusiondeficits in the vmPFC (vmPFC group; N = 13), (b) hypoperfusions sparing the vmPFC(nonvmPFC group; N = 12), and in (c) a control group of healthy volunteers(control group; N = 17). Regions of hypoperfusion were identified by means ofSingle Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). Participants were asked torecognize facial expressions of the 7 basic emotions (happiness, fear, surprise, anger, disgust, sadness, or neutral). Detection of facial expressions of fear,disgust, and surprise was affected after functional disruption of the vmPFC. The present study confirms the role of the vmPFC in recognizing emotional facialexpressions.
 Some older adults without neurological disease exhibit impaired decision-makingin risky, nontransparent situations, like the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Theprefrontal cortices are particularly vulnerable to age-related decline, andnumerous studies implicate the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) insuccessful IGT performance. However, the relationship between IGT performance andVMPFC function in older adults has not yet been tested by fMRI. In the presentstudy, older adults with seemingly no cognitive impairments performed the IGT anda non-gambling control task during fMRI. Group analyses indicate that in theseolder adults, regardless of IGT performance level, a right VMPFC subregion isactivated during the IGT, while successful IGT performance is correlated withleft VMPFC activation, suggesting that bilateral VMPFC during risky,nontransparent situations may contribute to successful decision-making in olderadults. Individual subject analyses reveal substantial variation regarding theextent and location of VMPFC activation during the IGT, a finding not captured inthe group analysis: There is no correlation between IGT performance and extent ofactivation in the right VMPFC, although there is such a correlation between left VMPFC activation and IGT performance.
 Observers of sports can reliably estimate who is leading or trailing based onnonverbal cues. Most likely, this is due to an adaptive mechanism of detectingmotivationally relevant signals such as high status, superiority, and dominance. We reasoned that the relevance of leading athletes should lead to a sustainedattentional prioritization. To test this idea, we recorded electroencephalographywhile 45 participants saw brief stills of athletes and estimated whether theywere leading or trailing. Based on these recordings, we assessed event-relatedpotentials and focused on the late positive complex (LPC), a well-establishedsignature of controlled attention to motivationally relevant visual stimuli.Confirming our expectation, we found that LPC amplitude was significantlyenhanced for leading as compared to trailing athletes. Moreover, this modulation was significantly related to behavioral performance on the score-estimation task.The present data suggest that subtle cues related to athletic supremacy arereliably differentiated in the human brain, involving a strong attentionalorienting toward leading athletes. This mechanism might be part of an adaptivecognitive strategy that guides human social behavior.
 Cognitive control supports goal-directed behavior by resolving conflict amongopposing action tendencies. Emotion can trigger cognitive control processes, thusspeeding up conflict processing when the target dimension of stimuli isemotional. However, it is unclear what role emotionality of the target dimension plays in the processing of emotional conflict (e.g. in irony). In two EEGexperiments, we compared the influence of emotional valence of the target(emotional, neutral) in cognitive and emotional conflict processing. To maximallyapproximate real-life communication, we used audiovisual stimuli. Participantseither categorized spoken vowels (cognitive conflict) or their emotional valence (emotional conflict), while visual information was congruent or incongruent.Emotional target dimension facilitated both cognitive and emotional conflictprocessing, as shown in a reduced reaction time conflict effect. In contrast, theN100 in the event-related potentials showed a conflict-specific reversal: theconflict effect was larger for emotional compared with neutral trials incognitive conflict and smaller in emotional conflict. Additionally,domain-general conflict effects were observed in the P200 and N200 responses. Thecurrent findings confirm that emotions have a strong influence on cognitive andemotional conflict processing. They also highlight the complexity andheterogeneity of the interaction of emotion with different types of conflict.
 Sociophysiology was a term used early in the history of sociology and then again 25 years ago to describe interactions between the "social" and the "biological"worlds. Social scientists had largely viewed biology and the brain as a "blackbox" that was not an active aspect of their work or theories. A landmark,unpublished conference in 1986 brought together social scientists and biologists dedicated to the idea that bringing sociological conceptualizations andapproaches together with those of physiology might create new ways to understand human behavior. The umbrella question for sociophysiology was dual: how do socialprocesses impact the physiology of the organism, and how does that alteredphysiology affect future social behavior? This paper summarizes that conferencewith the goal of providing a glimpse into the early history of socialneuroscience and to demonstrate the variety of individuals and interests thatwere present at the emergence of this new field. The late Patricia R. Barchasorganized and chaired the conference.
 In 1978, when the Task Panel report to the US President's Commission on MentalHealth emphasized the importance of improving health care and easing the pain of those suffering from emotional distress syndromes including loneliness, fewanticipated that this issue would still need to be addressed 40 years later. Ameta-analysis (Masi et al., 2011) on the efficacy of treatments to reduceloneliness identified a need for well-controlled randomized clinical trialsfocusing on the rehabilitation of maladaptive social cognition. We reviewassessments of loneliness and build on this meta-analysis to discuss the efficacyof various treatments for loneliness. With the advances made over the past 5years in the identification of the psychobiological and pharmaceutical mechanismsassociated with loneliness and maladaptive social cognition, there is increasing evidence for the potential efficacy of integrated interventions that combine(social) cognitive behavioral therapy with short-term adjunctive pharmacological treatments.
 Recent advances in cognitive-social neuroscience allow a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying dyadic relationships. From a neuronal viewpoint, desirein dyadic relationships involves a specific fronto-temporo-parietal network andalso a subcortical network that mediates conscious and unconscious mechanisms of reward, satisfaction, attention, self representation and self-expansion. Theintegration of this neuroscientific knowledge on the unconscious neurobiological activation for sexual desire in the human brain will provide physicians with new therapeutical and neuroscientific tools to apprehend sexual disorders in couple.
 Oxytocin modulates many aspects of social cognition and behaviors, includingmaternal nurturing, social recognition and bonding. Natural variation in oxytocinreceptor (OXTR) density in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is associated withvariation in alloparental behavior, and artificially enhancing OXTR expression inthe NAcc enhances alloparental behavior and pair bonding in socially monogamousprairie voles. Furthermore, infusion of an OXTR antagonist into the NAcc inhibitsalloparental behavior and partner preference formation. However, antagonists can promiscuously interact with other neuropeptide receptors. To directly examine therole of OXTR signaling in social bonding, we used RNA interference to selectivelyknockdown, but not eliminate, OXTR in the NAcc of female prairie voles andexamined the impact on social behaviors. Using an adeno-associated viral vectorexpressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Oxtr mRNA, we reduced accumbalOXTR density in female prairie voles from juvenile age through adulthood. Femalesreceiving the shRNA vector displayed a significant reduction in alloparentalbehavior and disrupted partner preference formation. These are the first directdemonstrations that OXTR plays a critical role in alloparental behavior and adultsocial attachment, and suggest that natural variation in OXTR expression in this region alone can create variation in social behavior.
 Maintaining sustained attention over time is an effortful process limited byfinite cognitive resources. Recent theories describe the role of motivation inthe allocation of such resources as a decision process: the costs of effortfulperformance are weighed against its gains. We examined this hypothesis bycombining methods from attention research and decision neuroscience. Participantsfirst performed a sustained attention task at different levels of reward. Theythen performed a reward-discounting task, measuring the subjective costs ofperformance. Results demonstrated that higher rewards led to improved performance(Exp 1-3), and enhanced attentional effort (i.e. pupil diameter; Exp 2 & 3).Moreover, discounting curves constructed from the choice task indicated thatsubjects devalued rewards that came at the cost of staying vigilant for a longer duration (Exp 1 & 2). Motivation can thus boost sustained attention throughincreased effort, while sustained performance is regarded as a cost against whichrewards are discounted.
 Criminal offenders (CO) are characterized by antisocial and impulsive lifestyles and reduced empathy competence. According to Zaki and Ochsner, empathy is aprocess that can be divided into three components: mentalizing, emotional sharingand prosocial concern. The aim of our study was to evaluate these competences in 74 criminal subjects compared to 65 controls. The CO group demonstrated a lowerability in measures of mentalizing and sharing, especially in recognizing themental and emotional states of other people by observing their eyes and sharingother people's emotions. Conversely, CO subjects showed better abilities inprosocial concern measures, such as judging and predicting the emotions andbehavior of other people, but they were not able to evaluate the gravity ofviolations of social rules as well as the control group. In addition, logisticregression results show that the higher the deficits in the mentalizing componentare, the higher the probability of committing a crime against another person.Taken together, our results suggest that criminal subjects are able to judge and recognize other people's behavior as right or wrong in a social context, but theyare not able to recognize and share the suffering of other people.
 Human brain specializations supporting language can be identified by comparinghuman with non-human primate brains. Comparisons with chimpanzees are critical inthis endeavor. Human brains are much larger than non-human primate brains, buthuman language capabilities cannot be entirely explained by brain size. Humanbrain specializations that potentially support our capacity for language include firstly, wider cortical minicolumns in both Broca's and Wernicke's areas comparedwith great apes; secondly, leftward asymmetries in Broca's area volume andWernicke's area minicolumn width that are not found in great apes; and thirdly,arcuate fasciculus projections beyond Wernicke's area to a region of expandedassociation cortex in the middle and inferior temporal cortex involved inprocessing word meaning.
 Quantifying attention to social stimuli during the viewing of complex socialscenes with eye tracking has proven to be a sensitive method in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders years before average clinical diagnosis. Rhesusmacaques provide an ideal model for understanding the mechanisms underlyingsocial viewing behavior, but to date no comparable behavioral task has beendeveloped for use in monkeys. Using a novel scene-viewing task, we monitored the gaze of three rhesus macaques while they freely viewed well-controlled composedsocial scenes and analyzed the time spent viewing objects and monkeys. In each ofsix behavioral sessions, monkeys viewed a set of 90 images (540 unique scenes)with each image presented twice. In two-thirds of the repeated scenes, either amonkey or an object was replaced with a novel item (manipulated scenes). Whenviewing a repeated scene, monkeys made longer fixations and shorter saccades,shifting from a rapid orienting to global scene contents to a more local analysisof fewer items. In addition to this repetition effect, in manipulated scenes,monkeys demonstrated robust memory by spending more time viewing the replaceditems. By analyzing attention to specific scene content, we found that monkeysstrongly preferred to view conspecifics and that this was not related to theirsalience in terms of low-level image features. A model-free analysis of viewingstatistics found that monkeys that were viewed earlier and longer had direct gazeand redder sex skin around their face and rump, two important visual social cues.These data provide a quantification of viewing strategy, memory and socialpreferences in rhesus macaques viewing complex social scenes, and they provide animportant baseline with which to compare to the effects of therapeutics aimed at enhancing social cognition.
 The ability to empathize with the suffering of others is critical for maintainingrelationships and engaging in prosocial behavior. Recently, a series of studieshave demonstrated that while watching other people experience pain (other pain), participants engage the anterior insula (AI) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),brain regions involved in the direct experience of pain (self pain). Here we testthe hypothesis that common activity in ACC and AI may reflect the operation ofdistinct but overlapping networks of regions that support perception of self orother pain. To address this possibility, we scanned participants using fMRI whilethey received noxious thermal stimulation (self pain) or watched short videos of other people sustaining painful injuries (other pain). We isolated overlappingregions for self and other pain in the ACC and AI and then used them as seedregions for two kinds of functional connectivity analyses. These analysesidentified areas whose activity co-varied with ACC and AI activity during self orother pain either across time (intra-individual connectivity) or acrossparticipants (inter-individual connectivity). Both connectivity analysesidentified clusters in the midbrain and periaqueductal gray with greaterconnectivity to the AI during self pain as opposed to other pain. The oppositepattern was found in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, that showed greaterconnectivity to the ACC and AI during other pain than during self pain using bothtypes of analysis. Intra-individual connectivity analyses also revealed regionsin the superior temporal sulcus, posterior cingulate, and precuneus that becamemore connected to ACC during other pain as compared to self pain. Together, thesedata demonstrated that regions showing similar activity during self and otherpain may nonetheless be part of distinct functional networks. These networkscould not have been detected in prior work that examined overlap between self andother pain in terms of average activity, but not connectivity.
 Human social cognition relies on an ability to predict what others will think,feel or do in novel situations. Research in social neuroscience has consistently observed several brain regions that contribute ubiquitously to these abilities,including medial prefrontal cortex and aspects of lateral and medial parietalcortex. Interestingly, parallel work has suggested that this same network ofregions subserves several seemingly distinct phenomena-notably, the abilities to remember the past, imagine the future and visualize spatial layouts-suggestingthe existence of a common set of cognitive processes devoted to projectingoneself into worlds that differ mentally, temporally or physically from one'scurrent experience. This use of self-projection to understand others' mindsrequires perceivers to solve three distinct cognitive challenges: (i) generating a simulated facsimile of one's own hypothetical mental states in a givensituation, (ii) suppressing one's own current mental states, and (iii) decidingon the appropriateness of simulated states for understanding a particular otherperson. The present paper reviews recent psychology and neuroscience researchaimed at understanding the underlying mechanisms that allow humans to solve each of these cognitive challenges to use self-projection to predict and understandthe mental states of others.
 To celebrate the first 10 years of Nature Reviews Neuroscience, we invited theauthors of the most cited article of each year to look back on the state of theirfield of research at the time of publication and the impact their article hashad, and to discuss the questions that might be answered in the next 10 years.This selection of highly cited articles provides interesting snapshots of theprogress that has been made in diverse areas of neuroscience. They show theenormous influence of neuroimaging techniques and highlight concepts that havegenerated substantial interest in the past decade, such as neuroimmunology,social neuroscience and the 'network approach' to brain function. Theseadvancements will pave the way for further exciting discoveries that lie ahead.
 A recently published study by the present authors reported evidence thatfunctional changes in the anterior cingulate cortex within a sample of 96criminal offenders who were engaged in a Go/No-Go impulse control tasksignificantly predicted their rearrest following release from prison. In anextended analysis, we use discrimination and calibration techniques to test theaccuracy of these predictions relative to more traditional models and theirability to generalize to new observations in both full and reduced models. Modestto strong discrimination and calibration accuracy were found, providingadditional support for the utility of neurobiological measures in predictingrearrest.
 The present study examined directional connections in the brain amongresting-state networks (RSNs) when the participant had their eyes open (EO) orhad their eyes closed (EC). The resting-state fMRI data were collected from 20healthy participants (9 males, 20.17 +/- 2.74 years) under the EO and EC states. Independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to identify the separated RSNs(i.e., the primary/high-level visual, primary sensory-motor, ventral motor,salience/dorsal attention, and anterior/posterior default-mode networks), and theGaussian Bayesian network (BN) learning approach was then used to explore theconditional dependencies among these RSNs. The network-to-network directionalconnections related to EO and EC were depicted, and a support vector machine(SVM) was further employed to identify the directional connection patterns thatcould effectively discriminate between the two states. The results indicated thatthe connections among RSNs are directionally connected within a BN during the EO and EC states. The directional connections from the salience network (SN) to the anterior/posterior default-mode networks and the high-level to primary-levelvisual network were the obvious characteristics of both the EO and ECresting-state BNs. Of the directional connections in BN, the directionalconnections of the salience and dorsal attention network (DAN) were observed tobe discriminative between the EO and EC states. In particular, we noted that the properties of the salience and DANs were in opposite directions. Overall, thepresent study described the directional connections of RSNs using a BN learningapproach during the EO and EC states, and the results suggested that thedirectionality of the attention systems (i.e., mainly for the salience and theDAN) in resting state might have important roles in switching between the EO and EC conditions.
 As a popular form of recreational risk taking, gambling games offer a paradigmfor decision neuroscience research. As an individual behavior, gambling becomesdysfunctional in a subset of the population, with debilitating consequences.Gambling disorder has been recently reconceptualized as a "behavioral addiction" in the DSM-5, based on emerging parallels with substance use disorders. Why dosome individuals undergo this transition from recreational to disorderedgambling? The biomedical model of problem gambling is a "brain disorder" account that posits an underlying neurobiological abnormality. This article firstdelineates the neural circuitry that underpins gambling-related decision making, comprising ventral striatum, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dopaminergicmidbrain, and insula, and presents evidence for pathophysiology in this circuitryin gambling disorder. These biological dispositions become translated intoclinical disorder through the effects of gambling games. This influence is betterarticulated in a public health approach that describes the interplay between the player and the (gambling) product. Certain forms of gambling, includingelectronic gambling machines, appear to be overrepresented in problem gamblers.These games harness psychological features, including variable ratio schedules,near-misses, "losses disguised as wins," and the illusion of control, whichmodulate the core decision-making circuitry that is perturbed in gamblingdisorder.
 Because youth with aggressive conduct disorder (CD) often inflict pain on others,it is important to determine if they exhibit atypical empathic responses toviewing others in pain. In this initial functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) study, eight adolescents with aggressive CD and eight matched controlswith no CD symptoms were scanned while watching animated visual stimuli depictingother people experiencing pain or not experiencing pain. Furthermore, thesesituations involved either an individual whose pain was caused by accident or an individual whose pain was inflicted on purpose by another person. After scanning,participants rated how painful the situations were. In both groups the perceptionof others in pain was associated with activation of the pain matrix, includingthe ACC, insula, somatosensory cortex, supplementary motor area andperiaqueductal gray. The pain matrix was activated to a specific extent inparticipants with CD, who also showed significantly greater amygdala, striatal,and temporal pole activation. When watching situations in which pain wasintentionally inflicted, control youth exhibited signal increase in the medialprefrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and right temporo-parietaljunction, whereas youth with CD only exhibited activation in the insula andprecentral gyrus. Furthermore, connectivity analyses demonstrated that youth withCD exhibited less amygdala/prefrontal coupling when watching pain inflicted byanother than did control youth. These preliminary findings suggest that youthwith aggressive CD exhibit an atypical pattern of neural response to viewingothers in pain that should be explored in further studies.
 The regulation and function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA)axis and glucocorticoids have been well conserved across vertebrate species.Glucocorticoids influence a wide range of physiological functions that includeglucose regulation, metabolism, inflammatory control, as well as cardiovascular, reproductive, and neuronal effects. Some of these are relatively quick-actingnon-genomic effects, but most are slower-acting genomic effects. Thus, anystimulus that affects HPA function has the potential to exert wide-rangingshort-term and long-term effects on much of vertebrate physiology. Here, wereview the effects of social isolation on the functioning of the HPA axis insocial species, and on glucocorticoid physiology in social mammals in particular.Evidence indicates that objective and perceived social isolation alter HPAregulation, although the nature and direction of the HPA response differs amongspecies and across age. The inconsistencies in the direction and nature of HPAeffects have implications for drawing cross-species conclusions about the effectsof social isolation, and are particularly problematic for understandingHPA-related physiological processes in humans. The animal and human data areincommensurate because, for example, animal studies of objective isolation havetypically not been modeled on, or for comparability with, the subjectiveexperience of isolation in humans. An animal model of human isolation must betaken more seriously if we want to advance our understanding of the mechanismsfor the effects of objective and perceived isolation in humans.
 Diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD) include instabilityin identity and interpersonal relationships. Here, we probed whether instability is already present in BPD patients' thoughts about themselves and others. Wetested BPD patients (N=27) and healthy controls (N=25) with a mind-wandering taskthat assesses content and variability of stimulus-independent self-generatedthoughts. Multi-level modeling revealed that while BPD patients and healthycontrols mind-wander to a similar extent, BPD patients' thoughts are coloredpredominantly negatively. Most importantly, although their thoughts concerned theself and others as much as in controls, they fluctuated more strongly in thedegree to which their thoughts concerned themselves and others and also gave moreextreme ratings. Self- and other related thoughts that were more extreme werealso more negative in valence. The increased variability supports currentconceptualizations of BPD and may account for the instability in identity andinterpersonal relationships.
 Social buffering, a subset of social support, is the process through which theavailability of a conspecific reduces the activity of stress-mediatingneurobiological systems. While its role in coping and resilience is significant, we know little about its developmental history in humans. This brief reviewpresents an integrative developmental account of the social buffering ofhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) stress reactivity in humans, frominfancy to adulthood. During infancy, parents are powerful stress-regulators for children, but child temperament also plays a role and interacts with parentingquality to predict the magnitude of stress responses to fear or pain stimuli.Recent work indicates that parental support remains a potent stress buffer intolate childhood, but that it loses its effectiveness as a buffer of the HPA axisby adolescence. Puberty may be the switch that alters the potency of parentalbuffering. Beginning in middle childhood, friends may serve as stress buffers,particularly when other peers are the source of stress. By adulthood, romanticpartners assume this protective role, though studies often reveal sex differencesthat are currently not well understood. Translational research across specieswill be critical for developing a mechanistic understanding of social bufferingand the processes involved in developmental changes noted in this review.
 Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by interpersonaldifficulties, whereby patients are negatively biased concerning the evaluation ofothers' trustworthiness. Here, we examined the effect of oxytocin oninterpersonal behavior of BPD patients in a trust game, emphasizing theassessment of facial attractiveness of the patients' counterparts in the game,and patients' history of childhood trauma. Thirteen BPD patients and thirteenhealthy controls played a trust game after receiving oxytocin or placebo in arandomized, double-blind crossover design. Childhood trauma was evaluated usingthe Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Patients transferred less money in the oxytocin condition compared to placebo. While healthy controls transferred moremoney units (MUs) to attractive counterparts than to unattractive ones only afterthe administration of oxytocin, BPD patients showed this pattern in bothconditions. Emotional neglect during childhood negatively correlated with theamount of MUs transferred by patients under oxytocin, but not placebo. Oxytocinhad a trust-lowering effect in BPD, which was correlated with patients' historyof childhood trauma. Patients' evaluation of interpersonal trust seems to depend more on attractiveness features of their counterparts than in controls, a findingthat may have important implications for further research on the usefulness of"prosocial" peptides as an adjunct to psychotherapeutic interventions.
 Social species are so characterized because they form organizations that extendbeyond the individual. The goal of social neuroscience is to investigate thebiological mechanisms that underlie these social structures, processes, andbehavior and the influences between social and neural structures and processes.Such an endeavor is challenging because it necessitates the integration ofmultiple levels. Mapping across systems and levels (from genome to social groups and cultures) requires interdisciplinary expertise, comparative studies,innovative methods, and integrative conceptual analysis. Examples of how socialneuroscience is contributing to our understanding of the functions of the brainand nervous system are described, and societal implications of socialneuroscience are considered.
 Empathy involves affective, cognitive, and emotion regulative components. Theaffective component relies on the sharing of emotional states with others and is discussed here in relation to the human Mirror System. On the other hand, thecognitive component is related to understanding the mental states of others anddraws upon literature surrounding Theory of Mind (ToM). The final component,emotion regulation, depends on executive function and is responsible for managingthe degree to which explicit empathic responses are made. This mini-reviewprovides information on how each of the three components is individually affectedby group membership and how this leads to in-group bias.
 Oxytocin has been implicated in parent-infant attachment and social recognition. With respect to emotion recognition memory, both memory-enhancing and impairingeffects have been observed, suggesting an influence of individual factors. Weassessed the effects of oxytocin on memory for infant cues, and whether theseeffects are moderated by self-reported childhood emotional maltreatment.Nulliparous females (N = 102) participated in a randomized, double-blind,between-subjects study with intranasal oxytocin or placebo administration.Participants' memory was tested using the Baby Social Reward Task, whereparticipants were asked to select the happier infant from a pair of two infantsbased on the information that they received about the infants' mood in theprevious phase. Participants reporting more childhood emotional maltreatment wereless accurate in this task after inhaling oxytocin. Our findings add to a growingbody of literature showing that the effects of intranasal oxytocin on memory and social behavior are moderated by adverse early life experiences.
 Social neuroscience and its potential implications create an interesting casestudy for examining human research ethics policies on the topic of publiccommunication of research. We reviewed mainstream national and internationalhuman research ethics guidelines and policies on issues of public communicationof research. Our analysis relied on five thematic nets to capture theinteractions between research and the public: public understanding, knowledgetranslation, public participation, social outcomes, and dual use. Coverage ofthese topics is sparse and inconsistent in mainstream policies and guidelines. Weidentify three options to address these gaps and analyze their strengths andweaknesses.
 Despite great progress in the science of social cognition, the old Victoriannotion of disinhibition is entrenched in our current thinking. According to this notion, the frontal lobes serve to inhibit the subcortical structures, and withthe release of such inhibition, innate behaviors are released. This paper makes acase that the notion of disinhibition is more than a problem of semantics and is rooted in an erroneous, social Darwinistic view of brain organization as ahierarchical and dichotomous order between cortical and subcortical structures,which has no anchorage in the hardwiring of the brain neuroanatomy that suggests a mutually reciprocal relationship between these structures.
 In the last years social neuroscience research attempted to identify the neuralnetworks underlying the human ability to perceive others' emotions, a coreprocess in establishing meaningful social bonds. A large amount of papers aroseand identified common and specific empathy-based networks with respect tostimulus type and task. Despite the great majority of studies focused onhuman-human contexts, we do not establish relations with only other humans, butalso with non-human animals. The aim of the present work was to explore the brainmechanisms involved in empathic concern for people who interacts with both peers and other species. Participants have been assessed by functional near-infraredspectroscopy (fNIRS) while viewing pictures depicting humans interacting withboth other men and women (human-human condition: HH), or with dogs and cats(human-animal: HA). Results showed that aggressive HH interactions elicitedgreater prefrontal activity (PFC) than HA ones while, when considering HAinteractions, friendly ones were related to higher cortical activity. Finally,oxy (O2Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) increasing related to the processing ofaggressive interactions positively correlated with different empathic measures,within more specific brain regions. Results were elucidated with respect toavailable evidence on emotion perception, empathic neural mechanisms and theirfunctional meaning for human-animal contexts.
 We hypothesize that framing effects (risk-averse in the positive frame andrisk-seeking in the negative frame) are likely to occur when ambiguous socialcontexts result in ambiguous or ambivalent risk preferences, leading thedecision-maker to search for more subtle cues, such as verbal framing. In afunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we examined framing effectsin both unambiguous homogeneous group and more ambiguous heterogeneous groupcontexts. We began by conducting a meta-analysis and identified three regions of interest: the right inferior frontal gyrus, the left anterior cingulate(ACC)/ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and the left amygdala. Our own fMRIdata were collected while the participants made choices between a sure option anda gamble framed in terms of the number of lives to either save or die. Theframing effect was evident in a heterogeneous context with a mixture of kin andstrangers, but disappeared in a homogeneous group of either all kin-members orall strangers. The fMRI results revealed a greater activation in the rightmiddle/inferior frontal gyrus under the negative than the positive framing, andless ACC/vmPFC deactivation under positive framing in the heterogamous/ambiguous context. The activation of the amygdala was correlated with greater risk-seeking preference in homogeneous kinship contexts.
 Attachment disorganization in infancy is a risk factor for behavior problems and other psychopathology. Traditionally the role of parental behavior forqualitative differences in early attachment relationships has been emphasized.However, disrupted infant-parent interactions only partly explain attachmentdisorganization. A complementary focus on child factors such as early differencesin the underlying neurobiological systems is needed. We examined whether earlystructural differences in the gangliothalamic ovoid, comprising the basal gangliaand the thalamus, are involved in the etiology of infant attachmentdisorganization. Gangliothalamic ovoid diameter was measured by ultrasound in6-week-old participants of a prospective population-based cohort study.Attachment classification of 629 of these infants was assessed with the strangesituation at 14 months of age. Neurobiological differences within the normalrange were prospectively associated with attachment disorganization. Infants witha larger gangliothalamic ovoid at 6 weeks had a lower risk of attachmentdisorganization at 14 months (OR = 0.73 per SD increase in diameter, 95% CI0.57-0.93, p < .05). Volume of the lateral ventricles as an index of generalbrain development was not associated with attachment disorganization. Thesefindings provide new insight into the etiology of infant attachmentdisorganization that may in part be neurodevelopmentally determined.
 Social neuroscience has made considerable progress in revealing the mechanismsunderlying empathy. We focused on the mechanism of perspective taking, which isone aspect of the empathic process that includes the emotional inhibitorymechanism, a function of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex using thenear-infrared spectroscopy. As a pretreatment, 19 participants played a game withconfederates playing either fairly or unfairly. Accordingly, each participantevaluated valence of their partner's faces. The data showed that taking the otherperspective of an unfair player activated the right ventrolateral prefrontalcortex in participants with high PT ability. In contrast, the behavioral datashowed no differences between those participants with high and low-perspectivetaking abilities. These results suggest that different types of empathic featurescan produce different perspective taking strategies.
 Politics is a manifestation of the uniquely human ability to debate, decide, and reach consensus on decisions affecting large groups over long durations of time. Recent neuroimaging studies on politics have focused on the association betweenbrain regions and specific political behaviors by adopting party or ideologicalaffiliation as a criterion to classify either experimental stimuli or subjects.However, it is unlikely that complex political beliefs (i.e., "the governmentshould protect freedom of speech") are evaluated only on aliberal-to-conservative criterion. Here we used multidimensional scaling andparametric functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify whichcriteria/dimensions people use to structure complex political beliefs and whichbrain regions are concurrently activated. We found that three independentdimensions explained the variability of a set of statements expressing political beliefs and that each dimension was reflected in a distinctive pattern of neural activation: individualism (medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietaljunction), conservatism (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and radicalism (ventralstriatum and posterior cingulate). The structures we identified are also known tobe important in self-other processing, social decision-making in ambivalentsituations, and reward prediction. Our results extend current knowledge on theneural correlates of the structure of political beliefs, a fundamental aspect of the human ability to coalesce into social entities.
 Movement sequencing difficulties are part of the neurological soft signs (NSS),they have high clinical value because they are not always present inschizophrenia. We investigated the neuronal correlates of movement sequencing in 24 healthy controls and 24 schizophrenia patients, with (SZP SQ+) or without (SZPSQ-) sequencing difficulties. We characterized simultaneous and lagged functionalconnectivity between brain regions involved in movement sequencing usingpsychophysiological interaction (PPI) and the Granger causality modeling (GCM),respectively. Left premotor cortex (PMC) and superior parietal lobule (SPL) were specifically activated during sequential movements in all participants. Right PMCand precuneus, ipsilateral to the hand executing the task, activated duringsequential movements only in healthy controls and SZP SQ-. SZP SQ+ showedhyperactivation in contralateral PMC, as compared to the other groups. PPIanalysis revealed a deficit in inhibitory connections within this fronto-parietalnetwork in SZP SQ+ during sequential task. GCM showed a significant laggedeffective connectivity from right PMC to left SPL during task and rest periods inall groups and from right PMC to right precuneus in SZP SQ+ group only. Both SZP groups had a significant lagged connectivity from right to left PMC, duringsequential task. Our results indicate that aberrant fronto-parietal networkconnectivity with cortical inhibition deficit and abnormal reliance on previousnetwork activity are related to movement sequencing in SZP. The overactivation ofmotor cortex seems to be a good compensating strategy, the hyperactivation ofparietal cortex is linked to motor deficit symptoms.
 Strong evidence indicates that reciprocal connections between the amygdala andthe medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) support fundamental aspects of emotionalbehavior in adulthood. However, this circuitry is slow to develop in humans,exhibiting immaturity in childhood. The argument is made that the development of this circuitry in humans is intimately associated with caregiving, such thatparental availability during childhood provides important and enduringscaffolding of neuroaffective processes that ultimately form of the nature of theadult phenotype.
 It has long been argued that attitudes prepare the body to act. While earlyevidence suggested that evaluations (positive or negative) are rigidly linked to specific motor behaviors (approach or avoidant), recent behavioral evidencesuggests that this linkage is context dependent. Here, we report that the neural circuitry mediating the relationship between evaluations and motor responsespromotes flexibility in our embodiment of attitudes. In a behavioral study,stimulus-response relationships between evaluations and actions were rapidlyconditioned. In a neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) study,repetition suppression demonstrated that these relationships are formed in neuralsystems traditionally implicated in arbitrary sensorimotor mappings (i.e. thedorsal premotor cortex and posterior superior parietal lobule). These dataprovide the first neurophysiological evidence for attitude embodiment anddemonstrate that relationships between evaluation and action are inherentlymalleable.
 A fundamental way that individuals differ is in the degree to which they prefersocial dominance hierarchy over egalitarianism as a guiding principle of societalstructure, a phenomenon known as social dominance orientation. Here we show that preference for hierarchical rather than egalitarian social relations varies as a function of neural responses within left anterior insula and anterior cingulatecortices. Our findings provide novel evidence that preference for socialdominance hierarchy is associated with neural functioning within brain regionsthat are associated with the ability to share and feel concern for the pain ofothers; this suggests a neurobiological basis for social and political attitudes.Implications of these findings for research on the social neuroscience offairness, justice, and intergroup relations are discussed.
 This fMRI study investigated neural systems that interpret body language-themeaningful emotive expressions conveyed by body movement. Participants watchedvideos of performers engaged in modern dance or pantomime that conveyed specific themes such as hope, agony, lust, or exhaustion. We tested whether the meaning ofan affectively laden performance was decoded in localized brain substrates as adistinct property of action separable from other superficial features, such aschoreography, kinematics, performer, and low-level visual stimuli. A repetitionsuppression (RS) procedure was used to identify brain regions that decoded themeaningful affective state of a performer, as evidenced by decreased activitywhen emotive themes were repeated in successive performances. Because the themewas the only feature repeated across video clips that were otherwise entirelydifferent, the occurrence of RS identified brain substrates that differentiallycoded the specific meaning of expressive performances. RS was observedbilaterally, extending anteriorly along middle and superior temporal gyri intotemporal pole, medially into insula, rostrally into inferior orbitofrontalcortex, and caudally into hippocampus and amygdala. Behavioral data on a separatetask indicated that interpreting themes from modern dance was more difficult thaninterpreting pantomime; a result that was also reflected in the fMRI data. There was greater RS in left hemisphere, suggesting that the more abstract metaphorsused to express themes in dance compared to pantomime posed a greater challengeto brain substrates directly involved in decoding those themes. We propose thatthe meaning-sensitive temporal-orbitofrontal regions observed here comprise asuperordinate functional module of a known hierarchical action observationnetwork (AON), which is critical to the construction of meaning from expressivemovement. The findings are discussed with respect to a predictive coding model ofaction understanding.
 In primates the gaze conveys important information about what others attend toand about their intentions. The ability to follow the gaze direction ofconspecifics has been established for several primate species. It has beenproposed to be a precursor for more complex cognitive skills related to mindreading. Studies in humans and other primates have shown that this behaviordevelops during the period between infancy and adulthood; however, the mechanismsresponsible for its emergence are still unknown. In a series of experiments weinvestigated such mechanisms in macaques (Macaca nemestrina). Results show thatjuvenile macaques improve their ability to follow the gaze of a humanexperimenter and that adults' ability to follow gaze is more accurate than thatof juveniles. Our data also show that this behavior can emerge as the result oflearning processes. The discrepancy between the relatively long period of timeneeded for the full establishment of the gaze-following behavior and its highsensitivity to conditioning procedures may suggest that social experience andintegration of this behavior with other social-cognitive skills are required for its development.
 Research has shown that gaze cuing of attention is reflected in the modulation ofP1 and N1 components of ERPs time-locked to target onset. Studies focusing oncue-locked analyses have produced mixed results. The present study examined ERPreflections of gaze cuing in further detail by recording electric brain activity from the scalp of participants engaged in a spatial cuing paradigm withnoninformative gaze cues embedded in fearful, disgusted, or neutral faces. Unlikeprevious work, we focused on N2pc, a recent ERP index of attention shifting over space. Behavioral data showed that gaze-driven orienting was not influenced byfacial expression. Importantly, electrophysiological data showed a significantamplitude modulation of the N2pc time-locked to target onset as a function ofcue--target spatial congruence. This pattern, however, was independent of facial expression. The results are interpreted as evidence that N2pc can be used as amarker of reorienting of attention in spatially incongruent trials due to gazecuing. The overall findings support the idea that the effects of facialexpression on gaze cuing are weak and likely context-dependent.
 Although evolution has shaped human infant crying and the corresponding response from caregivers, there is marked variation in paternal involvement and caretakingbehavior, highlighting the importance of understanding the neurobiologysupporting optimal paternal responses to cries. We explored the neural responseto infant cries in fathers of children aged 1-2, and its relationship withhormone levels, variation in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, parental attitudes and parental behavior. Although number of AR CAG trinucleotide repeats waspositively correlated with neural activity in brain regions important for empathy(anterior insula and inferior frontal gyrus), restrictive attitudes wereinversely correlated with neural activity in these regions and with regionsinvolved with emotion regulation (orbitofrontal cortex). Anterior insula activityhad a non-linear relationship with paternal caregiving, such that fathers withintermediate activation were most involved. These results suggest thatrestrictive attitudes may be associated with decreased empathy and emotionregulation in response to a child in distress, and that moderate anterior insula activity reflects an optimal level of arousal that supports engaged fathering.
 In contrast to abstract trait words which describe people's general personality, gossip is about personal affairs of others. Although neural correlates underlyingprocessing self-related trait words have been well documented, it remains poorly understood how the human brain processes gossip. In the present fMRI study,participants were instructed to rate their online emotional states upon hearingpositive and negative gossip about celebrities, themselves, and their bestfriends. Explicit behavioral ratings suggested that participants were happier to hear positive gossip and more annoyed to hear negative gossip about themselvesthan about celebrities and best friends. At the neural level, dissociated neural networks were involved in processing the positive gossip about self and thenegative gossip about celebrities. On the one hand, the superior medialprefrontal cortex responded not only to self-related gossip but also to moraltransgressions, and neural activity in the orbital prefrontal cortex increasedlinearly with pleasure ratings on positive gossip about self. On the other hand, although participants' ratings did not show they were particularly happy onhearing negative gossip about celebrities, the significantly enhanced neuralactivity in the reward system suggested that they were indeed amused. Moreover,via enhanced functional connectivity, the prefrontal executive control networkwas involved in regulating the reward system by giving explicit pleasure ratings according to social norm compliance, rather than natural true feelings.
 The personal significance of a language statement depends on its communicativecontext. However, this is rarely taken into account in neuroscience studies.Here, we investigate how the implied source of single word statements alterstheir cortical processing. Participants' brain event-related potentials wererecorded in response to identical word streams consisting of positive, negative, and neutral trait adjectives stated to either represent personal trait feedbackfrom a human or to be randomly generated by a computer. Results showed a strongimpact of perceived sender. Regardless of content, the notion of receivingfeedback from a human enhanced all components, starting with the P2 andencompassing early posterior negativity (EPN), P3, and the late positivepotential (LPP). Moreover, negative feedback by the "human sender" elicited alarger EPN, whereas positive feedback generally induced a larger LPP. Sourceestimations revealed differences between "senders" in visual areas, particularly the bilateral fusiform gyri. Likewise, emotional content enhanced activity inthese areas. These results specify how even implied sender identity changes theprocessing of single words in seemingly realistic communicative settings,amplifying their processing in the visual brain. This suggests that the conceptof motivated attention extends from stimulus significance to simultaneousappraisal of contextual relevance. Finally, consistent with distinct stages ofemotional processing, at least in contexts perceived as social, humans areinitially alerted to negative content, but later process what is perceived aspositive feedback more intensely.
 Recent reports of successful fMRI-based discrimination between lie and truth insingle subjects raised the interest of prospective users and a public concernabout the potential scope of this technology. The increased scrutiny highlighted the lack of controlled "real life", i.e. prospective clinical trials of thistechnology that conform to the common standards of medical device development.The ethics of conducting such trials given the paucity of data on fMRI-based lie detection has also been questioned. To probe the potential issues of translating the laboratory research into practice, we conducted a case study in which weadapted the standard Guilty Knowledge Test (GKT), a well-established model ofproducing deception, to the common scenario of lying on a resume. The taskconsisted of questions about pertinent items on the subject's resume, three ofwhich could be independently verified as truth (KNOWN) and three that could notbe verified and were thus termed UNKNOWN. The subject had an incentive to lie on all UNKNOWN items, and on debriefing confirmed that he had done so. Data waspreprocessed, masked with a priori regions of interest, thresholded, andqualitatively evaluated for consistency with the previously reportedprefronto-parietal Lie > Truth pattern. Deceptive responses to two out of thethree UNKNOWN items were associated with the predicted prefronto-parietal fMRIpattern. In the third UNKNOWN this pattern was absent, and instead, increasedlimbic (amygdala and hippocampus) response was observed. Based on publishedprefronto-parietal Lie response pattern, only the first two items could becategorized as Lie. If confirmed, this demonstration of amygdala and hippocampus activation in a Lie > Truth contrast illustrates the need to integrate the limbicsystem and its emotional and cognitive correlates into the existing model ofdeception. Our experiment suggests an approach to a naturalistic scenario and theresearch questions that need to be answered in order to set the stage forprospective clinical trials of fMRI-based lie detection.
 BACKGROUND: Psychopathy is a disorder of personality characterized by severeimpairments of social conduct, emotional experience, and interpersonal behavior. Psychopaths consistently violate social norms and bring considerable financial,emotional, or physical harm to others and to society as a whole. Recentdevelopments in analysis methods of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), such asvoxel-based-morphometry (VBM), have become major tools to understand theanatomical correlates of this disorder. Nevertheless, the identification ofpsychopathy by neuroimaging or other neurobiological tools (e.g., genetictesting) remains elusive. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The main aim of this study was to develop an approach to distinguish psychopaths from healthy controls,based on the integration between pattern recognition methods and gray matterquantification. We employed support vector machines (SVM) and maximum uncertaintylinear discrimination analysis (MLDA), with a feature-selection algorithm.Imaging data from 15 healthy controls and 15 psychopathic individuals (7 women ineach group) were analyzed with SPM2 and the optimized VBM preprocessing routines.Participants were scanned with a 1.5 Tesla MRI system. Both SVM and MLDA achievedan overall leave-one-out accuracy of 80%, but SVM mapping was sparser than using MLDA. The superior temporal sulcus/gyrus (bilaterally) was identified as a regioncontaining the most relevant information to separate the two groups.CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that gray matter quantitativemeasures contain robust information to predict high psychopathy scores inindividual subjects. The methods employed herein might prove useful as an adjunctto the established clinical and neuropsychological measures in patient screening and diagnostic accuracy.
 An essential tension can be found between researchers interested in ecologicalvalidity and those concerned with maintaining experimental control. Research inthe human neurosciences often involves the use of simple and static stimulilacking many of the potentially important aspects of real world activities andinteractions. While this research is valuable, there is a growing interest in thehuman neurosciences to use cues about target states in the real world viamultimodal scenarios that involve visual, semantic, and prosodic information.These scenarios should include dynamic stimuli presented concurrently or seriallyin a manner that allows researchers to assess the integrative processes carriedout by perceivers over time. Furthermore, there is growing interest incontextually embedded stimuli that can constrain participant interpretations ofcues about a target's internal states. Virtual reality environments profferassessment paradigms that combine the experimental control of laboratory measureswith emotionally engaging background narratives to enhance affective experienceand social interactions. The present review highlights the potential of virtualreality environments for enhanced ecological validity in the clinical, affective,and social neurosciences.
 The development and application of neuroimaging methods offers powerful means to study brain functions, but the resulting knowledge is more likely to bebeneficial when combined with conceptual analyses that decompose complexpsychological constructs into component structures, representations, processes,and computations; converging measures that gauge neural events at differenttemporal and spatial scales; behavioral measures that permit fine-grain analyses of brain-behavior associations; and experimental (e.g., lesion studies and/ortranscranial magnetic stimulation) and nonhuman animal studies that test theputative role of specific brain structures, circuits, or processes. In addition, quantitative meta-analyses are important to move beyond idiosyncrasies ofindividual studies, and neurodevelopmental investigations can contribute to ourunderstanding of brain-behavior associations.
 Humiliation, the emotion associated with being lowered in status in the eyes ofothers, seems to be very intense. As such, humiliation has been implied to playan important role in the escalation of inter-individual and inter-group conflict.Here, we provide the first clear empirical evidence that humiliation is indeed a very intense experience. Based on the electro-encephalogram recorded from people reading scenarios that evoked humiliation, anger, or happiness,electrophysiological measures of cognitive intensity were derived for each of theemotion types. The late positive potential (LPP), a measure of the level ofperceived (negative), affect was markedly increased in humiliation scenarioscompared to happiness and anger scenarios. In addition, event-relateddesynchronization (ERD) in the alpha-frequency range, a measure of the overallintensity of cortical activation, was significantly more pronounced forhumiliation than for happiness and anger scenarios. Our findings support the ideathat humiliation is a particularly intense experience that is likely to havefar-reaching consequences.
 Ideomotor movements may arise in observers while they watch other people'sactions. Previous studies have shown that ideomotor movements are guided by both perceptual and intentional characteristics of the actions being observed(perceptual induction and intentional induction, respectively; cf. Knuf,Aschersleben, & Prinz, 2001; de Maeght & Prinz, 2004). In the present study weexplore the functional basis of intentional induction. More specifically we raisethe issue of whose intentions count for intentional induction: observers' ownintentions or observees' (implied) intentions? We studied ideomotor movements in a cooperative and a competitive task setting. In the cooperative settingobservers' and observees' intentions were identical, but in the competitivesetting they were different. Results indicate that ideomotor movements are guidedby the observers' own intentions, not the observees' implied intentions. Ourfindings suggest that, though observers understand the intentions of others,their ideomotor movements are guided by their own intentions, expressing whatthey themselves wish to see the other is doing.
 In the present study, the social ranking perception in competition was explored. Brain response (alpha band oscillations, EEG; hemodynamic activity, O2Hb), aswell as self-perception of social ranking, cognitive performance, and personalitytrait (Behavioral Activation System, BAS) were considered during a competitivejoint-action. Subjects were required to develop a strategy to obtain a betteroutcome than a competitor (C) (in term of error rate, and response time, RT). Apre-feedback (without a specific feedback on the performance) and a post-feedbackcondition (which reinforced the improved performance) were provided. It was foundthat higher-BAS participants responded in greater measure to perceived highercognitive performance (post-feedback condition), with increased left prefrontalactivity, higher ranking perception, and a better real performance (reduced RTs).These results were explained in term of increased sense of self-efficacy andsocial position, probably based on higher-BAS sensitivity to reinforcingconditions. In addition, the hemispheric effect in favor of the left sidecharacterized the competitive behavior, showing an imbalance for high-BAS incomparison to low-BAS in the case of a rewarding (post-feedback) context.Therefore, the present results confirmed the significance of BAS in modulatingbrain responsiveness, self-perceived social position, and real performance duringan interpersonal competitive action which is considered highly relevant forsocial status.
 The expertise of others is a major social influence on our everyday decisions andactions. Many viewers of art, whether expert or naive, are convinced that thefull esthetic appreciation of an artwork depends upon the assurance that the workis genuine rather than fake. Rembrandt portraits provide an interesting image setfor testing this idea, as there is a large number of them and recent scholarship has determined that quite a few fakes and copies exist. Use of this image setallowed us to separate the brain's response to images of genuine and fakepictures from the brain's response to external advice about the authenticity ofthe paintings. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, viewing of artworksassigned as "copy," rather than "authentic," evoked stronger responses infrontopolar cortex (FPC), and right precuneus, regardless of whether the portraitwas actually genuine. Advice about authenticity had no direct effect on thecortical visual areas responsive to the paintings, but there was a significantpsycho-physiological interaction between the FPC and the lateral occipital area, which suggests that these visual areas may be modulated by FPC. We propose thatthe activation of brain networks rather than a single cortical area in thisparadigm supports the art scholars' view that esthetic judgments aremulti-faceted and multi-dimensional in nature.
 Expectations for what functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can offerpsychophysiology vary greatly. Overreaching enthusiasm such as the idea that fMRIcan reveal lies and political attitudes are as common as the opinion that fMRI,in its current form, is useless for the advancement of psychological theories.Errors in the inferences being drawn from fMRI data may be contributing to eachof these extreme positions, so the present paper addresses these several commoninferential errors and describes some of the potential of fMRI forpsychophysiological theory and research.
 Religious beliefs are both catchy and durable: they exhibit a high degree ofadherence to our cognitive system, given their success of transmission andspreading throughout history. A prominent explanation for religion's culturalsuccess comes from the "MCI hypothesis," according to which religious beliefs areboth easy to recall and desirable to transmit because they are minimallycounterintuitive (MCI). This hypothesis has been empirically tested at conceptand narrative levels by recall measures. However, the neural correlates of MCIconcepts remain poorly understood. We used the N400 component of theevent-related brain potential as a measure of counterintuitiveness of violations comparing religious and non-religious sentences, both counterintuitive, whenpresented in isolation. Around 80% in either condition were core-knowledgeviolations. We found smaller N400 amplitudes for religious as compared tonon-religious counterintuitive ideas, suggesting that religious ideas are lesssemantically anomalous. Moreover, behavioral measures revealed that religiousideas are not readily detected as unacceptable. Finally, systematic analyses ofour materials, according to conceptual features proposed in cognitive models ofreligion, did not reveal any outstanding variable significantly contributing tothese differences. Refinements of cognitive models of religion should elucidatewhich combination of factors renders an anomaly less counterintuitive and thusmore suitable for recall and transmission.
 The ability to represent the mental states of other agents is referred to asTheory of Mind (ToM). A developmental breakthrough in ToM consists ofunderstanding that others can have false beliefs about the world. Recently,infants younger than 2 years of age have been shown to pass novel implicit false belief tasks. However, the processes underlying these tasks and their relation tolater-developing explicit false belief understanding, as well as to othercognitive abilities, are not yet understood. Here, we study a battery of implicitand explicit false belief tasks in 3- and 4-year-old children, relating theirperformance to linguistic abilities and executive functions. The present datashow a significant developmental change from failing explicit false belief tasks at 3 years of age to passing them at the age of 4, while both age groups passimplicit false belief tasks. This differential developmental trajectory isreflected by the finding that explicit and implicit false belief tasks do notcorrelate. Further, we demonstrate that explicit false belief tasks correlatewith syntactic and executive functions, whereas implicit false belief tasks donot. The study thus indicates that the processes underlying implicit false belieftasks are different from later-developing explicit false belief understanding.Moreover, our results speak for a critical role of syntactic and executivefunctions for passing standard explicit false belief tasks in contrast toimplicit tasks.
 This article explores boundaries of the intellectual map of inter-groupprocesses, going to the macro (social structure) boundary and the micro (neuralsystems) boundary. Both are illustrated by with my own and others' work on socialstructures and on neural structures related to inter-group processes. Analysingthe impact of social structures on inter-group processes led to insights aboutdistinct forms of sexism and underlies current work on forms of ageism. Thestereotype content model also starts with the social structure of inter-grouprelations (interdependence and status) and predicts images, emotions, andbehaviours. Social structure has much to offer the social psychology ofinter-group processes. At the other, less explored boundary, social neuroscience addresses the effects of social contexts on neural systems relevant tointer-group processes. Both social structural and neural analyses circle back to traditional social psychology as converging indicators of inter-group processes.
 Current theories predict opposing effects of emotionally arousing information on false memory. If emotion enhances true recollection, then false recollectionmight be lower for emotional than for neutral pictures. However, if emotionenhances conceptual relatedness, then false recollection might increase fornonstudied but emotionally related pictures. We contrasted these 2 factors inyoung and older adults, using the International Affective Pictures Systems set(Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert, 2005). Although both age groups used recollection in our task, false recollection was greatest for emotional pictures, supporting aconceptual relatedness account. Finally, even after accuracy differences werecontrolled, age was related to high-confidence false recollection of emotionalpictures.
 The distinction between utilitarianism and deontology has become a prevailingframework for conceptualizing moral judgment. According to the principle ofutilitarianism, the morality of an action depends on its outcomes. In contrast,the principle of deontology states that the morality of an action depends on its consistency with moral norms. To identify the processes underlying utilitarianand deontological judgments, research in psychology and neuroscience hasinvestigated responses to moral dilemmas that pit one principle against the other(e.g., trolley dilemma). However, the interpretation of responses in thisparadigm is ambiguous, because the defining aspects of utilitarianism anddeontology, outcomes and norms, are not manipulated. We illustrate how thisshortcoming distorts interpretations of empirical findings and describe analternative approach that overcomes the limitations of the traditional paradigm.
 Our recently published analytic toolbox (Cacioppo et al., 2014), running underMATLAB environment and Brainstorm, offered a theoretical framework and set ofvalidation studies for the automatic detection of event-related changes in theglobal pattern and global field power of electrical brain activity. Here, weprovide a step-by-step tutorial of this toolbox along with a detailed descriptionof analytical plans (aka the Chicago Electrical Neuroimaging Analytics, CENA) forthe statistical analysis of brain microstate configuration and global field powerin within and between-subject designs. Available CENA functions include: (1) adifference wave function; (2) a high-performance microsegmentation suite (HPMS), which consists of three specific analytic tools: (i) a root mean square error(RMSE) metric for identifying stable states and transition states across discreteevent-related brain microstates; (ii) a similarity metric based on cosinedistance in n dimensional sensor space to determine whether template maps forsuccessive brain microstates differ in configuration of brain activity, and (iii)global field power (GFP) metrics for identifying changes in the overall level of activation of the brain; (3) a bootstrapping function for assessing the extent towhich the solutions identified in the HPMS are robust (reliable, generalizable)and for empirically deriving additional experimental hypotheses; and (4)step-by-step procedures for performing a priori contrasts for data analysis. CENAis freely available for brain data spatiotemporal analyses athttps://hpenlaboratory.uchicago.edu/page/cena, with sample data, user tutorialvideos, and documentation.
 Falls, a common cause of injury among older adults, have become increasinglyprevalent. As the world's population ages, the increase in-and the prevalenceof-falls among older people makes this a serious and compelling societal andhealthcare issue. Physical weakness is a critical predictor in falling. Whileconsiderable research has examined this relationship, comprehensive reviews ofneuropsychological predictors of falls have been lacking. In this paper, weexamine and discuss current studies of the neuropsychological predictors of fallsin older adults, as related to sporting and non-sporting contexts. By integratingthe existing evidence, we propose that brain aging is an important precursor ofthe increased risk of falls in older adults. Brain aging disrupts the neuralintegrity of motor outputs and reduces neuropsychological abilities. Older adultsmay shift from unconscious movement control to more conscious or attentive motor control. Increased understanding of the causes of falls will afford opportunitiesto reduce their incidence, reduce consequent injuries, improve overall well-beingand quality of life, and possibly to prolong life.
 Music is used to regulate mood and arousal in everyday life and to promotephysical and psychological health and well-being in clinical settings. However,scientific inquiry into the neurochemical effects of music is still in itsinfancy. In this review, we evaluate the evidence that music improves health and well-being through the engagement of neurochemical systems for (i) reward,motivation, and pleasure; (ii) stress and arousal; (iii) immunity; and (iv)social affiliation. We discuss the limitations of these studies and outline novelapproaches for integration of conceptual and technological advances from thefields of music cognition and social neuroscience into studies of theneurochemistry of music.
 Recent behavioral and neuroscientific studies have revealed the preferentialprocessing of superior-hierarchy cues. However, it remains poorly understoodwhether top-down controlled mechanisms modulate temporal dynamics ofneurocognitive substrates underlying the preferential processing of thesebiologically and socially relevant cues. This was investigated in the currentstudy by recording event-related potentials from participants who were presented with superior or inferior social hierarchy. Participants performed ahierarchy-judgment task that required attention to hierarchy cues or agender-judgment task that withdrew their attention from these cues.Superior-hierarchy cues evoked stronger neural responses than inferior-hierarchy cues at both early (N170/N200) and late (late positive potential, LPP) temporalstages. Notably, the modulations of top-down attention were identified on the LPPcomponent, such that superior-hierarchy cues evoked larger LPP amplitudes thaninferior-hierarchy cues only in the attended condition; whereas the modulationsof the N170/N200 component by hierarchy cues were evident in both attended andunattended conditions. These findings suggest that the preferential perception ofsuperior-hierarchy cues involves both relatively automatic attentional bias atthe early temporal stage as well as flexible and voluntary cognitive evaluationat the late temporal stage. Finally, these hierarchy-related effects were absent when participants were shown the same stimuli which, however, were not associatedwith social-hierarchy information in a non-hierarchy task (Experiment 2),suggesting that effects of social hierarchy at early and late temporal stagescould not be accounted for by differences in physical attributes between thesesocial cues.
 It is not uncommon for people to openly admit to pirating information from theinternet despite the known legal consequences. Those same people are often lessinclined to steal the same physical item from a shop. This raises the question,why do people have fewer reservations with stealing intangible items compared to tangible? Using questionnaires and fMRI we provide evidence across three studies as to the differences between tangible and intangible theft. In a questionnaire(Study 1), participants revealed that across different conditions they were more willing to steal intangible compared to tangible goods. Study 2a used fMRI toreveal that a network involved in imagining objects was more active whenparticipants were representing intangible versus tangible objects, suggestingpeople have greater difficulty representing intangible items. Study 2b used fMRI to show that when stealing tangible objects versus intangible, participants hadincreased activation in left lateral orbitofrontal cortex, an area typicallyactivated in response to morally laden situations. The findings from the current investigation provide novel insights into the higher prevalence of intangibletheft and suggest that differential neural representation of tangible andintangible items may, in part, explain why people are more willing to stealintangible items.
 The aim of this study was to investigate the functional anatomy ofdecision-making during the Iowa Gambling Task in patients with Parkinson'sdisease. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)during a computerized version of IGT to compare 18 PD patients on dopaminergicmedication in the ON state and 18 healthy control subjects. Our analyses focused on outcome evaluation following card selection, because we expected this aspectof decision-making to be impaired in PD patients. The PD patients exhibited loweractivation of the left putamen than the control group as a reaction to penalty.Using psychophysiological interaction analysis, we identified decreasedfunctional connectivity between the right globus pallidus internus and the leftanterior cingulate gyrus in the PD group. In contrast, increased connectivitybetween these structures was observed after penalty in the control group. Ourresults suggest altered functioning of the basal ganglia and their connectionswith the cortical structures involved in the limbic loop (e.g., the limbicfronto-striatal circuit of the basal ganglia) during decision-making in PDpatients. Differences in the response to loss could be associated withinsufficient negative reinforcement after a loss in PD patients in the ON statein comparison to a healthy population.
 Pathological gambling is an addictive disorder characterized by an irresistibleurge to gamble despite severe consequences. One of the hallmarks of pathological gambling is maladaptive and highly risky decision-making, which has been linkedto dysregulation of reward-related brain regions such as the ventral striatum.However, previous studies have produced contradictory results regarding theimplication of this network, revealing either hypo- or hypersensitivity tomonetary gains and losses. One possible explanation is that the gambling brainmight be misrepresenting the benefits and costs when weighting the potentialoutcomes, and not the gains and losses per se. To address this issue, weinvestigated whether pathological gambling is associated with abnormal brainactivity during decisions that weight the utility of possible gains againstpossible losses. Pathological gamblers and healthy human subjects underwentfunctional magnetic resonance imaging while they accepted or rejected mixedgain/loss gambles with fifty-fifty chances of winning or losing. Contrary tohealthy individuals, gamblers showed a U-shaped response profile reflectinghypersensitivity to the most appetitive and most aversive bets in an executivecortico-striatal network including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and caudatenucleus. This network is concerned with the evaluation of action-outcomecontingencies, monitoring recent actions and anticipating their consequences. Thedysregulation of this specific network, especially for extreme bets with largepotentials consequences, offers a novel understanding of the neural basis ofpathological gambling in terms of deficient associations between gambling actionsand their financial impact.
 The authors explored cortical correlates of action execution and observation,directly comparing control condition condition and execution-observation, usingfunctional near-infrared spectroscopy. Transitive actions (meaningful gesturesproduced in presence of an object) or intransitive actions (meaningful gesturesproduced in absence of an object) were performed. Increased oxygenated hemoglobinlevels were revealed for both action execution and action observation in premotorcortex, and sensorimotor cortex compared to control condition. However, a higher activity in motor areas was observed for action execution than motor observation.In contrast the posterior parietal cortex was similarly activated in case of bothexecution and observation task. Finally, it was shown that action execution andobservation of transitive more than intransitive gestures was supported bysimilar parietal posterior areas. These findings support the hypothesis of apartial common network for observation and execution of action, and significantimplications related to action types (transitive vs. intransitive).
 Attachment to one's kin as an in-group emerges from a fundamental humanmotivation and is vital for human survival. Despite important recent advances in the field of social neuroscience, the neural mechanisms underlying family-relatedin-group perception remain obscure. To examine the neural basis of perceivingfamily-related in-group boundaries in response to written kinship scenarios, weused functional magnetic resonance imaging in 27 healthy adults and obtainedself-report ratings of family-related entitativity, which measures to what degreeparticipants perceive their family as a coherent and distinct group in society.We expected that activity in the subgenual cingulate cortex andsepto-hypothalamic region would track individual differences in entitativity.Perceiving one's family as a distinct and cohesive group (high entitativity) was associated with increased subgenual cortex response to kinship scenarios. Thesubgenual cingulate cortex may represent a key link between kin-related emotionalattachment and group perception, providing a neurobiological basis for groupbelongingness.
 It has been recently demonstrated that pain behavior in the mouse can bemodulated by the presence of a conspecific, but what remains unclear is whethersuch pain behavior can serve the function of soliciting social approach. Using a novel social approach paradigm, we tested mice in various dyadic or triadicconditions, including "jailed" mice-some in pain via intraperitoneal injection of0.9% acetic acid-and test mice free to approach or avoid the jailed mice. Weobserved a sex-specific effect whereby female, but not male, test mice approacheda familiar same-sex conspecific in pain more frequently than an unaffectedfamiliar or unfamiliar, but affected, conspecific. Despite a substantialliterature emphasizing oxytocin's role in affiliative and pair-bonding behavior, this effect was also observed in female mice lacking the oxytocin receptor,suggesting that pain-related social approach may not be mediated by oxytocin.Furthermore, we found that the frequency of contact by the test mouse wasnegatively correlated with the pain behavior of the jailed mouse, suggesting thatproximity of a familiar unaffected conspecific may have analgesic properties.
 We investigated whether greed would predict risky decision-making and recordedneural responses during a monetary gambling task using the electroencephalogram. We found that individuals high in trait-greed took higher risks to maximizemonetary outcome. Furthermore, this relation was moderated by state-greed;specifically, trait-greed had a stronger impact on risky decision-making whenactivated by situational characteristics. On the neural level, greedy individualsshowed a specific response to favorable and unfavorable outcomes. Specifically,they had a reduced feedback-related negativity-difference score to these events, indicating that they might have difficulty in learning from experience,especially from mistakes and negative feedback. It is concluded that greed mayexplain risky and reckless behavior in diverse settings, such as investmentbanking, and may account for phenomena such as stock market bubbles.
 How do human brains integrate content with social context in communication?Recent research demonstrates that the perceived communicative embedding ofperceptually identical language messages alters their cortical processing. Whenemotional trait-adjectives are perceived as human-generated personality feedback,event-related brain potentials are considerably larger than when the sameadjectives are perceived as random computer-generated feedback. Here, weinvestigate the unique role of ascribed sender humanness for the underlyingneural mechanisms. Participants were told that they were going to receive writtenpositive, negative, or neutral feedback from an unknown stranger or from asocially intelligent computer system while high-density EEG was recorded. In the event-related potential (ERP), feedback from the 'human sender' elicited largerP2, Early Posterior Negativity (EPN), P3, and Late Positive Potential (LPP)components. The sources of this activity were localized in extended visualcortex, but also in the right superior frontal gyri, related to mentalizing aboutothers, and the bilateral postcentral gyri implicated in embodied languageprocessing. For emotional feedback, larger EPN, P3 and LPP amplitudes were alsoobserved, resulting from enhanced activity in visual and temporal regions.Finally, for the EPN an interaction between sender and emotion was found, showingsubstantially increased visual processing of human-generated emotional feedback. These data confirm visual amplification effects induced by motivated attentionbut crucially also reveal distinct effects of perceiving a communication partner as human that activate 'social brain' structures. Obviously who is perceived assaying something can be as relevant as what is said and induce specific brainactivity.
 The accurate perception of other people and their postures is essential forfunctioning in a social world. Our own bodies organize information from others tohelp us respond appropriately by creating self-other mappings between bodies. In this study, we investigated mechanisms involved in the processing of self-othercorrespondences. Reed and Farah (1995) showed that a multimodal, articulated bodyrepresentation containing the spatial relations among parts of the human body wasaccessed by both viewing another's body and moving one's own. Use of one part of the body representation facilitated the perception of homologous areas of otherpeople's bodies, suggesting that inputs from both the self and other activatedthe shared body representation. Here we investigated whether this self-othercorrespondence produced rapid facilitation or required additional processing timeto resolve competing inputs for a shared body representation. Using a modifiedReed and Farah dual-task paradigm, we found that processing time influencedbody-position memory: an interaction between body-part moved and body-partattended revealed a relative facilitation effect at the 5 s ISI, but interferenceat the 2 s ISI. Our results suggest that effective visual-motor integration from the self and other requires time to activate shared portions of the spatial body representation.
 In order to interact effectively, we need to represent our action as produced by human beings. According to direct access theories, the first steps of visualinformation processing offer us an informed direct grasp of the situation,especially when social and interpersonal components are implicated. Biologicalsystem detection may be the gateway of such smart processes and then mayinfluence initial stages of perception fostering adaptive social behaviour. Toinvestigate early neural correlates of human agency detection in ecologicalsituations with more high or low social impact, we compared scenes showing ahuman versus artificial agent interacting with a human agent. Twenty volunteersparticipated in the study. They were asked to observe dynamic visual stimulishowing realistic interactions. ERP (event-related potentials) were recorded.Each stimulus depicted an arm executing a gesture addressed to a human agent.Visual features of the arm were manipulated: in half of trials, it was real; inother trials, it was deprived of some details and transformed in a statue-likearm. EEG morphological analysis revealed an early negative deflection peaking at about 155 ms. Peak amplitude data have been statistically analysed byrepeated-measures ANOVAs. It was found that the peak was ampler in the leftinferior posterior region when the gesturing arm was human. The early negativedeflection, N150, which we found to be different between the human and artificialconditions, is presumably associated with human agency detection in highinterpersonal context.
 Using intracerebral EEG recordings in a large cohort of human subjects, weinvestigate the time course of neural cross-talk during a simple cognitive task. Our results show that human brain dynamics undergo a characteristic sequence ofsynchronization patterns across different frequency bands following a visualoddball stimulus. In particular, an initial global reorganization in the deltaand theta bands (2-8 Hz) is followed by gamma (20-95 Hz) and then beta band(12-20 Hz) synchrony.
 The cerebellum is thought to be engaged not only in motor control, but also inthe neural network dedicated to visual processing of body motion. However, thepattern of connectivity within this network, in particular, between the cortical circuitry for observation of others' actions and the cerebellum remains largelyunknown. By combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) withfunctional connectivity analysis and dynamic causal modelling (DCM), we assessed cerebro-cerebellar connectivity during a visual perceptual task with point-light displays depicting human locomotion. In the left lateral cerebellum, regions inthe lobules Crus I and VIIB exhibited increased fMRI response to biologicalmotion. The outcome of the connectivity analyses delivered the first evidence forreciprocal communication between the left lateral cerebellum and the rightposterior superior temporal sulcus (STS). Through communication with the rightposterior STS that is a key node not only for biological motion perception butalso for social interaction and visual tasks on theory of mind, the leftcerebellum might be involved in a wide range of social cognitive functions.
 The ability to detect emotional meaning in others' behavior constitutes a centralcomponent of social competence. Expressions of anger in particular presentsalient signals that play a major role in the regulation of social interactions. Investigations of human anger signals have to date used still pictures of facial expressions but so far the neurobiological basis of bodily communication of angerremains largely unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the presentstudy investigated the neural bases involved in perceiving anger signalsemanating from the whole body. Our study also investigates what the presence ofdynamic information adds to the perception of body expressions of anger.Participants were scanned while viewing stimuli (stills or videos) of angry andneutral whole-body expressions. Whole-body expressions of anger elicit activityin regions including the amygdala and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, whichplay a role in the affective evaluation of the stimuli. Importantly, theperception of dynamic body expressions of anger additionally engages thehypothalamus, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the temporal pole and thepremotor cortex, brain regions that are coupled with autonomic reactions andmotor responses related to defensive behaviors.
 The importance of understanding how we anticipate and prepare for being socially excluded is underscored by the numerous adverse mental and physical consequences of social rejection. In this study, we adapted a social exclusion paradigm, theLunchroom task, to investigate the use of social context cues in the formation ofsocial outcome expectations as indexed by the P3b, an ERP component associatedwith attention orientation and context updating. In this task, Black and Whiteparticipants were presented with either neutral or stereotyped cues prior tobeing exposed to simulated inclusion versus exclusion outcome scenarios. Blackparticipants showed evidence of (1) a significantly reduced P3b response toexclusions preceded by stereotyped cues relative to neutral cue-relatedexclusions and (2) a marginally significant increase in the P3b response toinclusions relative to exclusions when both were preceded by stereotyped cues.Both of these findings suggest a key role for the use of social cues in theformation of outcome expectations. In line with our hypothesis that the randomintermixing of inclusion and exclusion outcomes would prevent formation ofoutcome expectations when coupled with the absence of self-relevant cues, nooverall P3b modulations were observed among a comparison group of Whiteparticipants.
 A classical model of human attention holds that independent neural networksrealize stimulus-driven reorienting and executive control of attention.Questioning full independence, the two functions do, however, engage overlapping networks with activations in cingulo-opercular regions such as anterior insula(AI) and a reverse pattern of activation (stimulus-driven reorienting), anddeactivation (executive control) in temporoparietal junction (TPJ). To test forindependent versus shared neural mechanisms underlying stimulus-driven andexecutive control of attention, we used fMRI and a task that isolates individual from concurrent demands in both functions. Results revealed super-additiveincreases of left AI activity and behavioral response costs under concurrentdemands, suggesting a common bottleneck for stimulus-driven reorienting andexecutive control of attention. These increases were mirrored by non-additivedecreases of activity in the default mode network (DMN), including posterior TPJ,regions where activity increased with off-task processes. The deactivations inposterior TPJ were spatially separated from stimulus-driven reorienting relatedactivation in anterior TPJ, a differentiation that replicated in task-freeresting state. Furthermore, functional connectivity indicated inhibitory couplingbetween posterior TPJ and AI during concurrent attention demands. These resultsdemonstrate a role of AI in stimulus-driven and executive control of attentionthat involves down-regulation of internally directed processes in DMN.
 Previous studies have shown that situations relevant for human mating can affect the levels of many hormones. This study focused on thehypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis by measuring salivary cortisol levels in 84young men prior to and after a period of short social contact with a woman orman. Results showed that after contact with another man the cortisol levels ofthe participants declined according to the circadian release pattern of cortisol.However, cortisol levels in men declined less when they had contact with a woman.Furthermore, cortisol levels of men increased when they perceived the woman with whom they had contact as attractive. Our findings provide indirect evidence forthe role of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in human courtship. Duringsocial contact with attractive women, moderate increases in cortisol levels mayreflect apprehension over an opportunity for courtship.
 Infant survival and the development of secure and cooperative relationships arecentral to the future of the species. In humans, this relies heavily on theevolving early parent-infant social and affective relationship. While much isknown about the behavioural and psychological components of this relationship,relatively little is known about the underlying functional neuroanatomy.Affective and social neuroscience has helped to describe the main adult brainnetworks involved, but has so far engaged very little with developmentalfindings. In this review, we seek to highlight future avenues for research byproviding a coherent framework for describing the parent-infant relationship overthe first 18 months. We provide an outline of the evolving nature of therelationship, starting with basic orienting and recognition processes, andculminating in the infant's attainment of higher socio-emotional and cognitivecapacities. Key social and affective interactions, such as communication,cooperative play and the establishment of specific attachments propel thedevelopment of the parent-infant relationship. We summarise our current knowledgeof the developing infant brain in terms of structure and function, and how these relate to the emergent abilities necessary for the formation of a secure andcooperative relationship with parents or other caregivers. Important roles havebeen found for brain regions including the orbitofrontal, cingulate, and insular cortices in parent-infant interactions, but it has become clear that much moreinformation is needed about the developmental time course and connectivity ofthese regions.
 How we estimate uncertainty is important in decision neuroscience and haswide-ranging implications in basic and clinical neuroscience, from computational models of optimality to ideas on psychopathological disorders including anxiety, depression and schizophrenia. Empirical research in neuroscience, which has been based on divergent theoretical assumptions, has focused on the fundamentalquestion of how uncertainty is encoded in the brain and how it influencesbehaviour. Here, we integrate several theoretical concepts about uncertainty intoa decision-making framework. We conclude that the currently available evidenceindicates that distinct neural encoding (including summary statistic-typerepresentations) of uncertainty occurs in distinct neural systems.
 Conformity is an important aspect of social behavior. Two main motives have been identified: people may adapt their behavior to "play nice" despite knowing better(normative conformity) or they may accept the others' opinion as a valid sourceof information (informative conformity). Neuroimaging studies can help todistinguish between these two possibilities. Here, we present a functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study on memory conformity in a real groupsituation. We investigated the effects of group pressure on activity inhippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) which likely support informative and normative memory conformity, respectively. Furthermore, we related the singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4680 [called Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met] on the gene coding for COMT to both behavior and fMRI activation.Homozygous Met-allele carriers (Val-) behaved more conformist than carriers of atleast one Val-allele (Val+). In the neuroimaging data, we compared trials inwhich subjects were confronted with a majority of incorrect group responses totrials in which they were confronted with a majority of correct group responses. We found increased hippocampal activity when the majority of the group wascorrect, possibly indicating retrieval processes. Moreover, we observed enhanced activity in the ACC when the majority of the group was incorrect, suggesting thatconformity was mostly normative. Most interestingly, this latter effect was more pronounced for Val- as compared to Val+ participants. This offers a speculativeexplanation for the higher behavioral levels of social conformity in Val- allele carriers, because their subjectively perceived conflict in the presence of anincorrect group majority may have been higher. Overall, this study demonstrateshow the mechanisms leading to complex social behavior such as conformity can bestudied by combining genetic analyses and fMRI in social neuroscience paradigms.
 Human peer relations provide tangible benefits, including food and protection, aswell as emotional benefits. While social exclusion poses a threat to all of thesebenefits, the psychological threat is particularly susceptible to modulation bythe relation of the excluders to the excluded person. The current study usedfunctional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the effects of manipulating the gender relation of participants to their excluders during an interactiveball-toss game. Ventral anterior cingulate cortex activation was higher duringexclusion by same-gender peers, while right ventrolateral prefrontal cortexactivation negatively correlated with self-reported distress in other-genderexclusion. Results imply that exclusion by one's own gender is fundamentallydifferent from exclusion by the opposite gender, and suggest a regulatory rolefor ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in response to out-group exclusion.Individual differences in implicit gender attitudes modulated neural responses toexclusion. The importance of these findings to investigations of social cognitionis discussed.
 Most psychological models of perceptual decision making are of theaccumulation-to-threshold variety. The neural basis of accumulation in parietaland prefrontal cortex is therefore a topic of great interest in neuroscience. In contrast, threshold mechanisms have received less attention, and their neuralbasis has usually been sought in subcortical structures. Here I analyze a modelof a decision threshold that can be implemented in the same cortical areas asevidence accumulators, and whose behavior bears on two open questions in decisionneuroscience: (1) When ramping activity is observed in a brain region duringdecision making, does it reflect evidence accumulation? (2) Are changes inspeed-accuracy tradeoffs and response biases more likely to be achieved bychanges in thresholds, or in accumulation rates and starting points? The analysissuggests that task-modulated ramping activity, by itself, is weak evidence that abrain area mediates evidence accumulation as opposed to threshold readout; andthat signs of modulated accumulation are as likely to indicate thresholdadaptation as adaptation of starting points and accumulation rates. Theseconclusions imply that how thresholds are modeled can dramatically impactaccumulator-based interpretations of this data.
 Humans are amazingly experts at processing and recognizing faces, however thereare moderating factors of this ability. In the present study, we used theevent-related potential technique to investigate the influence of both race andgaze direction on visual working memory (i.e., VWM) face representations. In achange detection task, we orthogonally manipulated race (own-race vs. other-race faces) and eye-gaze direction (direct gaze vs. averted gaze). Participants wererequired to encode identities of these faces. We quantified the amount ofinformation encoded in VWM by monitoring the amplitude of the sustained posteriorcontralateral negativity (SPCN) time-locked to the faces. Notably, race andeye-gaze direction differently modulated SPCN amplitude such that other-racefaces elicited reduced SPCN amplitudes compared with own-race faces only whendisplaying a direct gaze. On the other hand, faces displaying averted gaze,independently of their race, elicited increased SPCN amplitudes compared withfaces displaying direct gaze. We interpret these findings as denoting that raceand eye-gaze direction affect different face processing stages.
 Among its many roles in body and brain, oxytocin influences social behavior.Understanding the precise nature of this influence is crucial, both within thebroader theoretical context of neurobiology, social neuroscience and brainevolution, but also within a clinical context of disorders such as anxiety,schizophrenia, and autism. Research exploring oxytocin's role in human socialbehavior is difficult owing to its release in both body and brain and itsinteractive effects with other hormones and neuromodulators. Additionaldifficulties are due to the intricacies of the blood-brain barrier and oxytocin'sinstability, which creates measurement issues. Questions concerning how tointerpret behavioral results of human experiments manipulating oxytocin are thus made all the more pressing. The current paper discusses several such questions.We highlight unresolved fundamental issues about what exactly happens whenoxytocin is administered intranasally, whether such oxytocin does in fact reachappropriate receptors in brain, and whether central or peripheral influencesaccount for the observed behavioral effects. We also highlight the deeperconceptual issue of whether the human data should be narrowly interpreted asimplicating a specific role for oxytocin in complex social cognition, such agenerosity, trust, or mentalizing, or more broadly interpreted as implicating alower-level general effect on general states and dispositions, such as anxietyand social motivation. Using several influential studies, we show how seeminglyspecific, higher-level social-cognitive effects can emerge via a process by whichoxytocin's broad influence is channeled into a specific social behavior in acontext of an appropriate social and research setting. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Oxytocin, Vasopressin, and Social Behavior.
 Autism is associated with an inability to identify and distinguish one's ownfeelings. We assessed this inability using alexithymia and empathyquestionnaires, and used fMRI to investigate brain activity while introspectingon emotion. Individuals with high functioning autism/Asperger syndrome (HFA/AS)were compared with matched controls. Participants rated stimuli from theInternational Affective Picture System twice, once according to the degree ofun/pleasantness that the pictures induced, and once according to their colorbalance. The groups differed significantly on both alexithymia and empathyquestionnaires. Alexithymia and lack of empathy were correlated, indicating alink between understanding one's own and others' emotions. For both groups astrong relationship between questionnaire scores and brain activity was found in the anterior insula (AI), when participants were required to assess theirfeelings to unpleasant pictures. Regardless of self-reported degree of emotional awareness, individuals with HFA/AS differed from controls when required tointrospect on their feelings by showing reduced activation inself-reflection/mentalizing regions. Thus, we conclude that difficulties inemotional awareness are related to hypoactivity in AI in both individuals withHFA/AS and controls, and that the particular difficulties in emotional awareness in individuals with HFA/AS are not related to their impairments inself-reflection/mentalizing.
 The developing brain is traditionally viewed to possess a great compensatorypotential. Here we ask whether visual processing of point-light displaysdepicting human walking is compromised in adolescents who were born premature(between 27 and 33 gestation weeks) and suffer early bilateral damage toperiventricular brain regions. Combining psychophysics with volumetric analysisof structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we found that even relativelysmall periventricular parieto-occipital lesions may result in long-lastingbreakdown of visual processing of point-light displays. Analysis of receiveroperating characteristic (ROC) curves revealed higher susceptibility of thepatients' perceptual system to camouflage of a point-light figure. The lack ofdifference in sensitivity between former preterms with normal MRI scan andterm-born controls indicates that perceptual deficiencies in patients withperiventricular leukomalacia (PVL) are not simply due to premature birth. Mostimportantly, sensitivity in patients even with mild PVL was lower than in bothcontrol groups. Display 180 degrees inversion in the image plane, which is known to impair processing of point-light displays, resulted in a substantial reductionof sensitivity so that it no longer differed between the groups. Despite thesocial and ecological significance of human locomotion, the capacity of the brainto detect biological motion is substantially modulated by periventricular lesionseven if they occur very early in life. The findings point to specificrestrictions on the brain's spontaneous compensatory plasticity in perceptualdevelopment.
 Social neuroscience suggests medial pre-frontal cortex (mPFC) as necessary forsocial cognition. However, the mPFC activates less to members of extremeoutgroups that elicit disgust, an emotion directed toward both people andobjects. This study aimed to counteract that effect. Participants made eithersuperficial categorical age estimations or individuating food-preferencejudgments about people, while fMRI recorded neural activity. Besides replicating the reduced mPFC activity to extreme outgroups that elicit disgust, this studydemonstrates that the same type of judgment for these individuals is processed ina region anatomically distinct from social groups that elicit exclusively social emotions (pity, envy, pride). Finally, inferring individuating information (food preferences) increases mPFC activation above superficial categorical judgments.This evidence fits differentiated mPFC processing of extreme outgroups, whichactivate mPFC less than other groups, but suggests that individuation increasesactivation.
 Kinship terms have been found to be highly diverse across languages. Here weinvestigated the brain representation of kinship terms in two distinctpopulations, native Chinese and Caucasian English speakers, with a five-elementkinship identification (FEKI) task. The neuroimaging results showed a commonextensive frontal and parietal lobe brain activation pattern for differentkinship levels for both Chinese and Caucasian English speakers. Furthermore,Chinese speakers had longer reaction times and elicited more fronto-parietalbrain networks activation compared to English speakers in level three (e.g.,uncle and nephew) and four (e.g., cousin), including an association between themiddle frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobe, which might be associated withhigher working memory, attention control, and social distance representation loadin Chinese kinship system processing. These results contribute to ourunderstanding of the representation of kinship terms in the two languages.
 Prosocial behavior plays an important role in establishing and maintainingrelationships with others and thus may have important developmental implications.This study examines the association between cortical thickness and prosocialbehavior in a population-based sample of 6- to 9-year-old children. The presentstudy was embedded within the Generation R Study. Magnetic resonance scans wereacquired from 464 children whose parents had completed the prosocial scale of theStrengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. To study the association betweencortical thickness and prosocial behavior, we performed whole-brain surface-basedanalyses. Prosocial behavior was related to a thicker cortex in a cluster thatcovers part of the left superior frontal and rostral middle frontal cortex (p <.001). Gender moderated the association between prosocial behavior and corticalthickness in a cluster including the right rostral middle frontal and superiorfrontal cortex (p < .001) as well as in a cluster covering the right superiorparietal cortex, cuneus, and precuneus (p < .001). Our results suggest thatprosocial behavior is associated with cortical thickness in regions related totheory of mind (superior frontal cortex, rostral middle frontal cortex cuneus,and precuneus) and inhibitory control (superior frontal and rostral middlefrontal cortex).
 This study assessed whether individual differences in self-oriented neuralprocessing were associated with performance perceptions of minority studentsunder stereotype threat. Resting electroencephalographic activity recorded inwhite and minority participants was used to predict later estimates of taskerrors and self-doubt on a presumed measure of intelligence. We assessedspontaneous phase-locking between dipole sources in left lateral parietal cortex (LPC), precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (P/PCC), and medial prefrontal cortex(MPFC); three regions of the default mode network (DMN) that are integral forself-oriented processing. Results revealed that minorities with greater LPC-P/PCCphase-locking in the theta band reported more accurate error estimations. Allindividuals experienced less self-doubt to the extent they exhibited greaterLPC-MPFC phase-locking in the alpha band but this effect was driven byminorities. Minorities also reported more self-doubt to the extent theyoverestimated errors. Findings reveal novel neural moderators of stereotypethreat effects on subjective experience. Spontaneous synchronization between DMN regions may play a role in anticipatory coping mechanisms that buffer individualsfrom stereotype threat.
 The central melanocortin (MC) system has been widely studied for its effects onfood intake and sexual behavior. However, the MC system, and more specificallythe MC4 receptor (MC4R), also interacts with neurochemical systems that regulate socioemotional behaviors, including oxytocin (OT) and dopamine. In monogamousprairie voles, OT and dopamine interact to promote partner preference formation, a laboratory measure of an enduring social bond between mates. Here weinvestigated the effects of MC receptor activation on partner preferenceformation in prairie voles, as well as the interaction between the MC and OTsystems during this process. Peripheral administration of the brain penetrantMC3/4R receptor peptide agonist, Melanotan II (MTII), and the highly selective,small-molecule MC4R agonist, Pf-446687, enhanced partner preference formation in the prairie vole, but not in the non-monogamous meadow vole. MTII-induced partnerpreferences were enduring, as they were present 1 week after drug manipulation.The prosocial effects of MCR agonists may be mediated, in part, throughmodulation of OT, as coadministration of an OT receptor antagonist preventedMTII-induced partner preferences. MTII also selectively activated hypothalamic OTneurons and potentiated central OT release. As OT has been shown to enhance some aspects of social cognition in humans, our data suggest that the MC4R may be aviable therapeutic target for enhancing social function in psychiatric disorders,including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, potentially throughactivation of the OT system.
 Effective processing of threat-related stimuli is of significant evolutionaryadvantage. Given the intricate relationship between attention and the neuralprocessing of threat-related emotions, this study manipulated attentionallocation and emotional categories of threat-related stimuli as independentfactors and investigated the time course of spatial-attention-modulatedprocessing of disgusting and fearful stimuli. The participants were instructed todirect their attention either to the two vertical or to the two horizontallocations, where two faces and two houses would be presented. The task was torespond regarding the physical identity of the two stimuli at cued locations.Event-related potentials (ERP) evidences were found to support a two-stage model of attention-modulated processing of threat-related emotions. In the earlyprocessing stage, disgusted faces evoked larger P1 component at right occipitalregion despite the attention allocation while larger N170 component was elicited by fearful faces at right occipito-temporal region only when participantsattended to houses. In the late processing stage, the amplitudes of the parietal P3 component enhanced for both disgusted and fearful facial expressions only whenthe attention was focused on faces. According to the results, we propose that thetemporal dynamics of the emotion-by-attention interaction consist of two stages. The early stage is characterized by quick and specialized neural encoding ofdisgusting and fearful stimuli irrespective of voluntary attention allocation,indicating an automatic detection and perception of threat-related emotions. The late stage is represented by attention-gated separation between threat-relatedstimuli and neutral stimuli; the similar ERP pattern evoked by disgusted andfearful faces suggests a more generalized processing of threat-related emotionsvia top-down attentional modulation, based on which the defensive behavior inresponse to threat events is largely facilitated.
 The ability to attribute mental states to other individuals is crucial for human cognition. A milestone of this ability is reached around the age of 4, whenchildren start understanding that others can have false beliefs about the world. The neural basis supporting this critical step is currently unknown. Here, werelate this behavioural change to the maturation of white matter structure in 3- and 4-year-old children. Tract-based spatial statistics and probabilistictractography show that the developmental breakthrough in false beliefunderstanding is associated with age-related changes in local white matterstructure in temporoparietal regions, the precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex,and with increased dorsal white matter connectivity between temporoparietal andinferior frontal regions. These effects are independent of co-developingcognitive abilities. Our findings show that the emergence of mental staterepresentation is related to the maturation of core belief processing regions andtheir connection to the prefrontal cortex.
 The opioid system controls social behavior and it was hypothesized that ittherefore plays a role in neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism that arecharacterized by social and communication deficits. Mice communicate viaultrasonic vocalizations. As pups, they produce ultrasonic vocalizations whenisolated from dam and littermates. These calls serve an important biologicalpurpose, since they elicit search and retrieval behavior in the mother.Administration of mu-opioid-receptor-agonists diminishes such isolation-inducedultrasonic vocalizations and mu-opioid-receptor knock-out mouse pups (Orpm(-/-)) emit fewer ultrasonic vocalizations during isolation than intact controls(Orpm(+/+)). In adulthood, male and female mice produce ultrasonic vocalizations during social interactions. However, little is known about occurrence andfunction of ultrasonic vocalizations produced by adult females. Here, weconducted a playback experiment in order to assess whether female ultrasonicvocalizations elicit changes in the recipient's behavior and whether a possiblechange in behavior is dependent on a functioning opioid system by comparingOrpm(-/-) mice with Orpm(+/+) controls. Our results showed that female ultrasonicvocalizations elicit exploratory activity in male recipients and that elicitationof exploratory activity in response to female ultrasonic vocalizations isdependent on an intact opioid system, since such a response was not seen inOrpm(-/-) mice. Lack of exploratory activation seen in Orpm(-/-) mice is unlikelydue to hearing deficits as shown by an auditory cued fear-conditioning-task.Hence, these findings support the phenotypic relevance of Orpm(-/-) mice for the study of autism.
 We examined infants' oscillatory brain activity during a live interaction with anadult who showed them novel objects. Activation in the alpha frequency range was assessed. Nine-month-old infants responded with desynchronization of alpha-bandactivity when looking at an object together with an adult during a socialinteraction involving eye contact. When infant and experimenter only looked atthe object without engaging in eye contact, no such effect was observed. Results are interpreted in terms of activation of a generic semantic knowledge systeminduced by eye contact during a social interaction.
 Many species use facial features to identify conspecifics, which is necessary to navigate a complex social environment. The fundamental mechanisms underlying faceprocessing are starting to be well understood in a variety of primate species.However, most studies focus on a limited subset of species tested with unfamiliarfaces. As well as limiting our understanding of how widely distributed acrossspecies these skills are, this also limits our understanding of how primatesprocess faces of individuals they know, and whether social factors (e.g.dominance and social bonds) influence how readily they recognize others. In this study, socially housed crested macaques voluntarily participated in a series ofcomputerized matching-to-sample tasks investigating their ability to discriminate(i) unfamiliar individuals and (ii) members of their own social group. Themacaques performed above chance on all tasks. Familiar faces were not easier todiscriminate than unfamiliar faces. However, the subjects were better atdiscriminating higher ranking familiar individuals, but not unfamiliar ones. Thissuggests that our subjects applied their knowledge of their dominance hierarchiesto the pictorial representation of their group mates. Faces of high-rankingindividuals garner more social attention, and therefore might be more deeplyencoded than other individuals. Our results extend the study of face recognition to a novel species, and consequently provide valuable data for future comparativestudies.
 The social domain of the biopsychosocial model of pain has been greatlyunderstudied compared with the biological and psychological domains but holdsgreat promise for furthering our understanding, and better treatment, of pain.Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in social neuroscience and haverevealed the ability of pain stimuli to alter social interactions. Theseexperiments suggest that rodents are capable of producing simplified versions of any number of social phenomena involving empathy, previously thought to be thesole province of human beings. This review describes the state of science in bothhumans and nonhuman animals, and notes intriguing parallels in observations from both species. Indeed, my laboratory is starting to demonstrate perfectlytranslatable findings regarding social modulation of pain in rodents and humans.
 Social loafing and social facilitation are stable behavioral effects thatdescribe increased or decreased motivation, as well as effort and cooperation in teamwork as opposed to individual working situations. Recent twin studiesdemonstrate the heritability of cooperative behavior. Brain imaging studies have shown that reciprocity, cooperativeness, and social rewards activate rewardprocessing areas with strong dopaminergic input, such as the ventral striatum.Thus, candidate genes for social behavior are hypothesized to affect dopaminergicneurotransmission. In the present study, we investigated the dopaminergic geneticcontribution to social cooperation, especially to social loafing and socialfacilitation. N = 106 healthy, Caucasian subjects participated in the study andwere genotyped for three polymorphisms relevant to the dopaminergic system(COMTval158met, DRD2 c957t, DRD2 rs#2283265). In addition to a main effectindicating an increased performance in teamwork situations, we found asignificant interaction between a haplotype block covering both DRD2 singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs#6277 and rs#2283265), henceforth referred to as the DRD2-haplotype block, and the COMT val158met polymorphism (rs#4680) withsocial facilitation. Carriers of the DRD2 CT-haplotype block and at least oneVal-allele showed a greater increase in performance in teamwork settings whencompared with carriers of the CT-haplotype block and the Met/Met-genotype. Ourresults suggest that epistasis between COMTval158met and the two DRD2 SNPscontributes to individual differences in cooperativeness in teamwork settings.
 Animal models have shown that social isolation and other forms of social stresslead to depressive- and anxiety-relevant behaviors, as well as neuroendocrine andphysiological dysfunction. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of prior social isolation on neurotransmitter content following acute restraintin prairie voles. Animals were either paired with a same-sex sibling or isolated for 4 weeks. Plasma adrenal hormones and ex vivo tissue concentrations ofmonoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolites were measured following anacute restraint stressor in all animals. Isolated prairie voles displayedsignificantly increased circulating adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, as wellas elevated serotonin and dopamine levels in the hypothalamus, and potentiallydecreased levels of serotonin in the frontal cortex. However, no groupdifferences in monoamine levels were observed in the hippocampus or raphe. Theresults suggest that social stress may bias monoamine neurotransmission andstress hormone function to subsequent acute stressors, such as restraint. Thesefindings improve our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlyingthe consequences of social stress.
 Although extensive research on neural plasticity resulting from hearingdeprivation has been conducted, the direct influence of compromised audition onthe auditory cortex and the potential impact of long durations of incompletesensory stimulation on the adult cortex are still not fully understood. In thisstudy, using voxel-based morphometry, we evaluated gray matter (GM) volumechanges that may be associated with reduced hearing ability and the duration ofhearing impairment in 42 unilateral hearing loss (UHL) patients with acousticneuromas compared to 24 normal controls. We found significant GM volume increasesin the somatosensory and motor systems and GM volume decreases in the auditory(i.e., Heschl's gyrus) and visual systems (i.e., the calcarine cortex) in UHLpatients. The GM volume decreases in the primary auditory cortex (i.e., superior temporal gyrus and Heschl's gyrus) correlated with reduced hearing ability.Meanwhile, the GM volume decreases in structures involving high-level cognitivecontrol functions (i.e., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulatecortex) correlated positively with hearing loss duration. Our findingsdemonstrated that the severity and duration of UHL may contribute to thedissociated morphology of auditory and high-level neural structures, providinginsight into the brain's plasticity related to chronic, persistent partialsensory loss.
 Social neuroscience provides insights into the neural correlates of the humancapacity to explain and predict other people's intentions, a capacity that liesat the core of the Theory of Mind (ToM) mechanism. Results from neuroimagingresearch describe a widely distributed neural system underlying ToM, includingthe right and left temporo-parietal junctions (TPJ), the precuneus, and themedial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). Nevertheless, there is disagreement in theliterature concerning the key region for the ToM network. Some authors point tothe MPFC, others to the right TPJ. In the effort to make a contribution to thedebate, we propose a model of a dynamic ToM network consisting of four regions.We also introduce a novel theoretical distinction among varieties of intention,which differ by the nature of an individual's pursued goal (private or social)and by the social interaction's temporal dimension (present or future). Ourresults confirm the crucial role of both the MPFC and the right TPJ, but showthat these areas are differentially engaged depending on the nature of theintention involved. Whereas the right TPJ and the precuneus are necessary forprocessing all types of prior intentions, the left TPJ and the anteriorparacingulate cortex are specifically involved in the understanding of socialintention. More specifically, the left TPJ is activated only when a subset ofsocial intentions are involved (communicative intentions). Taken together, these results demonstrate the progressive recruitment of the ToM network along thetheoretical dimensions introduced in the present paper.
 Apathy, defined as a primary deficit in motivation and manifested by thesimultaneous diminution in the cognitive and emotional concomitants ofgoal-directed behavior, is a common and debilitating non-motor symptom ofParkinson's disease (PD). Despite the high prevalence and clinical significanceof apathy, little is known about its pathophysiology, and in particular howapathy relates to alterations in the neural circuitry underpinning the cognitive and emotional components of goal-directed behavior. Here, we examined the neural coding of reward cues in patients with PD, with or without clinically significantlevels of apathy, during performance of a spatial search task during H(2) (15)OPET (positron emission tomography) functional neuroimaging. By manipulatingsearch outcome (money reward vs valueless token), while keeping the actions ofthe participants constant, we examined the influence of apathy on the neuralcoding of money reward cues. We found that apathy was associated with a bluntedresponse to money in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, striatum, and midbrain, all part of a distributed neural circuit integral to the representationof the reward value of stimuli and actions, and the influence of reward cues onbehavior. Disruption of this circuitry potentially underpins the expression ofthe various manifestations of apathy in PD, including reduced cognitive,emotional, and behavioral facets of goal-directed behavior.
 The present fMRI study was aimed at assessing the cortical areas active whenindividuals observe non-object-directed actions (mimed, symbolic, andmeaningless), and when they imagine performing those same actions. fMRI signalincreases in common between action observation and motor imagery were found inthe premotor cortex and in a large region of the inferior parietal lobule. While the premotor cortex activation overlapped that previously found during theobservation and imagination of object-directed actions, in the parietal lobe the signal increase was not restricted to the intraparietal sulcus region, known tobe active during the observation and imagination of object-directed actions, but extended into the supramarginal and angular gyri. When contrasting motor imagery with the observation of non-object-directed actions, signal increases were found in the mesial frontal and cingulate cortices, the supramarginal gyrus, and theinferior frontal gyrus. The opposite contrast showed activation virtually limitedto visual areas. In conclusion, the present data define the common circuit forobserving and imagining non-object-directed actions. In addition, they show that the representation of non-object-directed actions include parietal regions notfound to be involved in coding object-directed actions.
 It is commonly assumed that early emotional signals provide relevant information for social cognition tasks. The goal of this study was to test the associationbetween (a) cortical markers of face emotional processing and (b)social-cognitive measures, and also to build a model which can predict thisassociation (a and b) in healthy volunteers as well as in different groups ofpsychiatric patients. Thus, we investigated the early cortical processing ofemotional stimuli (N170, using a face and word valence task) and theirrelationship with the social-cognitive profiles (SCPs, indexed by measures oftheory of mind, fluid intelligence, speed processing and executive functions).Group comparisons and individual differences were assessed among schizophrenia(SCZ) patients and their relatives, individuals with attention deficithyperactivity disorder (ADHD), individuals with euthymic bipolar disorder (BD)and healthy participants (educational level, handedness, age and gender matched).Our results provide evidence of emotional N170 impairments in the affected groups(SCZ and relatives, ADHD and BD) as well as subtle group differences.Importantly, cortical processing of emotional stimuli predicted the SCP, asevidenced by a structural equation model analysis. This is the first study toreport an association model of brain markers of emotional processing and SCP.
 Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms are manifested in socialdynamics. In this study, the brain activity of eight child and adolescentpatients diagnosed with ADHD was examined while they performed the CountingStroop task and results were interpreted using social neuroscience premises.Brain activity was identified in frontal, parietal, and temporal regions related to the orienting system of attention and with linguistic, facial recognition, andmnemonic processes. Consistent with previous reports, these patients showed noactivation in prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices related to the executivesystem of attention. Also, they manifested activation in the insular cortexinvolving interoceptive processes that may be associated with impulsiveness.Global brain activity involves a network formed during early development andincludes experiential components such as learning of rules, reward systems,empathy, and decision making. An integrative assessment of ADHD should considerpsychosocial and neurobiological causes integrated into an individual's ownexperiences assembled throughout life.
 It has been proposed that the human mirror neuron system (MNS) plays an integral role in mediating empathy. In this review, we critically examine evidence fromthree bodies of research that have been cited as supporting this notion: (1)behavioral studies that have examined the relationship between imitation andempathy, (2) findings from functional neuroimaging studies that report a positivecorrelation between MNS activation and self-report on an empathy questionnaire,and (3) observations of impaired imitation and empathy in autism spectrumdisorders (ASD). In addition, we briefly review lesion studies of the neuralcorrelates of imitation and empathy. Current evidence suggests that the MNS isbroadly involved in empathy, but at this stage there has been limitedconsideration of its various forms, including motor, emotional, and cognitiveempathy. There are also various forms of imitation, encompassing emotional andnon-emotional, automatic, and voluntary actions. We propose that the relationshipbetween imitation and empathy may vary depending on the specific type of each of these abilities. Furthermore, these abilities may be mediated by partiallydistinct neural networks, which involve the MNS to a variable degree.
 The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of valence infacial cues and object targets on event-related potential (ERPs) indices ofgaze-directed orienting. Participants were shown faces at fixation thatconcurrently displayed dynamic gaze shifts and expression changes from neutral tofearful or happy emotions. Emotionally-salient target objects subsequentlyappeared in the periphery and were spatially congruent or incongruent with thegaze direction. ERPs were time-locked to target presentation. Three sequentialERP components were modulated by happy emotion, indicating a progression from an expression effect to a gaze-by-expression interaction to a target emotion effect.These effects included larger P1 amplitude over contralateral occipital sites fortargets following happy faces, larger centrally distributed N1 amplitude fortargets following happy faces with leftward gaze, and faster P3 latency forpositive targets. In addition, parietally distributed P3 amplitude was reducedfor validly cued targets following fearful expressions. Results are consistentwith accounts of attentional broadening and motivational approach by happyemotion, and facilitation of spatially directed attention in the presence offearful cues. The findings have implications for understanding how socioemotionalsignals in faces interact with each other and with emotional features of objects in the environment to alter attentional processes.
 We analyzed peri-ictal bed leaving (PBL) symptoms in 105 patients with temporallobe epilepsy (TLE). All patients were classified as Engel I at the 2-yearfollow-up visit. Histopathological examination revealed hippocampal sclerosis(TLE-HS) in 64 patients and other lesions in 38 patients (TLE-other); 3 patients had no lesions. We reviewed 412 seizures. PBL was defined as lateralized leaving of the bed occurring during the seizure or up to 3 minutes after the end of theseizure. PBL was observed in 28 of 105 patients (26.7%), and in 45 of 412seizures (10.9%). PBL occurred more frequently in patients with TLE-HS than inpatients with TLE-other (32.8% vs 17.1%, P=0.058). PBL was ipsilateral to theseizure onset in 71.4% of patients and 71.2% of seizures (P=0.012 and P<0.001).In patients with TLE-HS, PBL was ipsilateral to seizure onset in 76.2% ofpatients and 81.2% of seizures (P=0.008 and P<0.001). In patients with TLE-other,PBL was ipsilateral to seizure onset in 42.8% of patients and 46.1% of seizures. There were no differences in the incidence and lateralizing value betweenpatients with right-sided and those with left-sided TLE. PBL is a relativelyfrequent peri-ictal sign in patients with TLE. The side of PBL in patients withTLE-HS lateralizes the seizure onset to the ipsilateral temporal lobe.
 In the present research we investigated whether the direction of the attentional bias in line bisection judgment displayed by healthy subjects is influenced bythe evaluation of the social distance between self and other. We used inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) trains over the right andleft parietal cortex to investigate the role of these regions in the task.Following right parietal rTMS, the self face is perceived as closer when it islocated at the right line endpoint; following left parietal rTMS, the self faceis perceived as closer when it is located at the left line endpoint. In bothcases, the side of space ipsilateral to the rTMS is underestimated from anattentional point of view, while it is overestimated from a social point of view.These results are a projection of how an individual perceives himself in thesocial relational space.
 There is a long standing debate on the influence of physiological signals onsocial behavior. Recent studies suggested that heart rate variability (HRV) maybe a marker of social cognitive processes. However, this evidence is preliminary and limited to laboratory studies. In this study 25 participants were assessedwith a social cognition battery and asked to wear a wearable device measuring HRVfor 6 consecutive days. The results showed that reduced HRV correlated withhigher hostility attribution bias. However, no relationship was found between HRVand other social cognitive measures including facial emotion recognition, theory of mind or emotional intelligence. These results suggest that HRV may be linkedto specific social cognitive processes requiring online emotional processing, in particular those related to social threat. These findings are discussed in thecontext of the neurovisceral integration model.
 Individuals with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been shown to experience significant problems in facial affect recognition (FAR). However,it is not known how these impairments relate to overall functioning and qualityof life (QoL) following TBI. The aim of the current study was to test thehypothesis that worse performance on an FAR task would be associated with reducedQoL (related to social and emotional functioning), worse mood, and increasedfatigue. Forty-seven individuals with TBI and 27 healthy controls (HCs) completedthe facial emotion identification task (FEIT), as well as questionnairesassessing social and emotional QoL, mood, and fatigue. The TBI group performedsignificantly worse than HCs on the FEIT. A significant relationship between FAR and fatigue and QoL related to social and emotional functioning was documented,but in an unexpected direction: individuals who performed better on the FEITreported poorer QoL and greater fatigue. Individuals who have better FAR mayrequire increased effort to perform this task, and thus experience greaterfatigue and poorer social and emotional QoL.
 The implicit positive association (IPA) theory attributed self-face advantage to the IPA with self-concept. Previous behavioral study has found that self-concept threat (SCT) could eliminate the self-advantage in face recognition overfamiliar-face, without taking levels of facial familiarity into account. Thecurrent event-related potential study aimed to investigate whether SCT couldeliminate the self-face advantage over stranger-face. Fifteen participantscompleted a "self-friend" comparison task in which participants identified theface orientation of self-face and friend-face after SCT and non-self-conceptthreat (NSCT) priming, and a "self-stranger" comparison task was also completedin which participants identified the face orientation of self-face andstranger-face after SCT and NSCT priming. The results showed that the N2amplitudes were more negative for processing friend-face than self-face afterNSCT priming, but there was no significant difference between them after SCTpriming. Moreover, the N2 amplitudes were more negative for processingstranger-face than self-face both after SCT priming and after NSCT priming.Furthermore, SCT manipulated the N2 amplitudes of friend-face rather thanself-face. Overall, the present study made a supplementary to the current IPAtheory and further indicated that SCT would only eliminate this self-facerecognition advantage when comparing with important others.
 Multiple sources of information from the face guide attention during socialinteraction. The present study modified the Posner cueing paradigm to investigatehow dynamic changes in emotional expression and eye gaze in faces affect theneural processing of subsequent target stimuli. Event-related potentials (ERPs)were recorded while participants viewed centrally presented face displays inwhich gaze direction (left, direct, right) and facial expression (fearful,neutral) covaried in a fully crossed design. Gaze direction was not predictive ofperipheral target location. ERP analysis revealed several sequential effects,including: (1) an early enhancement of target processing following fearful faces (P1); (2) an interaction between expression and gaze (N1), with enhanced targetprocessing following fearful faces with rightward gaze; and (3) an interactionbetween gaze and target location (P3), with enhanced processing for invalidlycued left visual field targets. Behaviorally, participants responded faster totargets following fearful faces and targets presented in the right visual field, in concordance with the P1 and N1 effects, respectively. The findings indicatethat two nonverbal social cues-facial expression and gaze direction-modulateattentional orienting across different temporal stages of processing. Resultshave implications for understanding the mental chronometry of shared attentionand social referencing.
 Since the discovery of mirror neurons, much effort has been invested intostudying their location and properties in the human brain. Here we review theseoriginal findings and introduce the main topics of this special issue of SocialNeuroscience. What does the mirror system code? How is the mirror system embeddedinto the mosaic of circuits that compose our brain? How does the mirror systemcontribute to communication, language and social interaction? Can the principleof mirror neurons be extended to emotions, sensations and thoughts? Papers using a wide range of methods, including single cell recordings, fMRI, TMS, EEG andpsychophysics, collected in this special issue, start to give us some impressive answers.
 Extensive animal and recent human research have helped informneuroendocrinological models of social cognition, motivation and behavior. Inthis review, we first summarize important findings regarding oxytocin, argininevasopressin and testosterone in the domains of affiliation, social cognition,aggression and stress/anxiety. We then suggest ways in which human research cancontinue to profit from animal research, particularly by exploring theinteractive nature of neuromodulatory effects at neurochemical, organismic andcontextual levels. We further propose methods inspired by the animal literaturefor the ecologically valid assessment of affiliative behavior in humans. Weconclude with suggestions for how human research could advance by directlyassessing specific social cognitive and motivational mechanisms as intermediatevariables. We advocate a more comprehensive look at the distinct networksidentified by social neuroscience and the importance of a motivational state, in addition to approach and avoidance, associated with quiescence and homeostaticregulation.
 The immune system is influenced by central nervous system processes that areshaped by social and psychological factors. Considerations of social factors,intrapersonal process, and autonomic psychophysiology therefore may contribute toa fuller understanding of both immune and brain function. Research reviewed here (a) examines the socioemotional factors that contribute to, or moderate,responses to brief and chronic stressors, (b) determines whether or not stableindividual differences in heart rate reactivity predict neuroendocrine and immuneresponses to a brief psychological stressor and to an influenza virus vaccine,and (c) investigates the autonomic origins of individual differences in low andhigh heart rate reactivity and their relationship to neuroendocrine and immuneresponses to chronic and acute stressors. Among our findings are: (a) acutepsychological stressors activate the sympathetic adrenomedullary system acrossindividuals and affect immune function; and (b) individuals characterized by highsympathetic cardiac reactivity to acute psychological stressors also show arelative activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical system andaltered immune function.
 More than half of the world's population now lives in cities, making the creationof a healthy urban environment a major policy priority. Cities have both healthrisks and benefits, but mental health is negatively affected: mood and anxietydisorders are more prevalent in city dwellers and the incidence of schizophrenia is strongly increased in people born and raised in cities. Although thesefindings have been widely attributed to the urban social environment, the neural processes that could mediate such associations are unknown. Here we show, usingfunctional magnetic resonance imaging in three independent experiments, thaturban upbringing and city living have dissociable impacts on social evaluativestress processing in humans. Current city living was associated with increasedamygdala activity, whereas urban upbringing affected the perigenual anteriorcingulate cortex, a key region for regulation of amygdala activity, negativeaffect and stress. These findings were regionally and behaviourally specific, as no other brain structures were affected and no urbanicity effect was seen during control experiments invoking cognitive processing without stress. Our resultsidentify distinct neural mechanisms for an established environmental risk factor,link the urban environment for the first time to social stress processing,suggest that brain regions differ in vulnerability to this risk factor across thelifespan, and indicate that experimental interrogation of epidemiologicalassociations is a promising strategy in social neuroscience.
 Primates are social animals, and their survival depends on social interactionswith others. Especially important for social interactions and welfare is theobservation of rewards obtained by other individuals and the comparison with own reward. The fundamental social decision variable for the comparison process isreward inequity, defined by an asymmetric reward distribution among individuals. An important brain structure for coding reward inequity may be the striatum, acomponent of the basal ganglia involved in goal-directed behavior. Two rhesusmonkeys were seated opposite each other and contacted a touch-sensitive tableplaced between them to obtain specific magnitudes of reward that were equally or unequally distributed among them. Response times in one of the animalsdemonstrated differential behavioral sensitivity to reward inequity. A group ofneurons in the striatum showed distinct signals reflecting disadvantageous andadvantageous reward inequity. These neuronal signals occurred irrespective of, orin conjunction with, own reward coding. These data demonstrate that striatalneurons of macaque monkeys sense the differences between other's and own reward. The neuronal activities are likely to contribute crucial reward information toneuronal mechanisms involved in social interactions.
 Identifying the causal processes involved in theory of mind (ToM) developmentduring childhood is an important goal for social neuroscience. This study aimedto investigate, for the first time, the extent to which individual differences inToM are influenced by genes and environment in middle childhood, and to assesshow ToM is linked to autistic-like behaviors and verbal ability. Over 6009-year-old twin pairs from a subsample of the Twins Early Development Study were assessed on an advanced test of ToM and on verbal ability. Parents, teachers, andthe children themselves provided ratings of the twins' autistic traits (socialimpairments, communication impairments, and restricted repetitive behaviors andinterests), using an abbreviated version of the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test.Autistic traits, particularly communication impairments, significantly predicted ToM performance. Verbal ability showed the strongest phenotypic association with ToM. Twin model-fitting was employed to investigate the causes of thisassociation. Much of the variation in ToM ability and in verbal ability wasexplained by environmental influences, with modest heritabilities for each, buttheir association was almost fully explained by shared genetic effects. Thepossible neural basis underlying this association is discussed.
 Stress has been associated with negative changes observed during the agingprocess. However, very little research has been carried out on the role of age inacute stress effects on memory. We aimed to explore the role of age and sex inthe relationship between hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) andsympathetic nervous system (SNS) reactivity to psychosocial stress and short-termdeclarative memory performance. To do so, sixty-seven participants divided intotwo age groups (each group with a similar number of men and women) were exposedto the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and a control condition in a crossoverdesign. Memory performance was assessed by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). As expected, worse memory performance was associated with age; but more interestingly, the stressor impaired recall after interference only in the older group. In addition, this effect was negatively correlated with the alpha-amylase over cortisol ratio, which has recently been suggested as a good marker of stresssystem dysregulation. However, we failed to find sex differences in memoryperformance. These results show that age moderates stress-induced effects ondeclarative memory, and they point out the importance of studying both of thephysiological systems involved in the stress response together.
 The implicit association test (IAT) is a promising method used to assessindividual implicit attitudes by indirectly measuring the strengths ofassociations between target and attribute categories. To date, the cognitiveprocesses involved in the prosocial attitude IAT task have received littleattention. The present study examined the temporal dynamics of the IAT thatmeasures prosocial attitude using event-related potentials (ERPs). ERP resultsrevealed enhanced N2 amplitudes for incongruent trials when compared withcongruent trials and enhanced P300 amplitudes for congruent trials when compared with incongruent trials. In addition, the N2 amplitude differences weresignificantly correlated with individual prosocial behavior (the amount ofdonation). Our findings suggest that conflict monitoring and stimuluscategorization processes are involved in the prosocial attitude IAT task and thatthe ERP indices of IATs that measure prosocial attitude may predict individualprosocial behavior.
 BACKGROUND: Although previous behavioral studies have shown that schizophreniapatients have impaired theory of mind (ToM), the neural mechanisms associatedwith this impairment are poorly understood. This study aimed to identify theneural mechanisms of ToM in schizophrenia, using functional magnetic resonanceimaging (fMRI) with a belief attribution task. METHODS: In the scanner, 12schizophrenia patients and 13 healthy control subjects performed the beliefattribution task with three conditions: a false belief condition, a falsephotograph condition, and a simple reading condition. RESULTS: For the falsebelief versus simple reading conditions, schizophrenia patients showed reducedneural activation in areas including the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) andmedial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) compared with controls. Further, during the falsebelief versus false photograph conditions, we observed increased activations inthe TPJ and the MPFC in healthy controls, but not in schizophrenia patients. For the false photograph versus simple reading condition, both groups showedcomparable neural activations. CONCLUSIONS: Schizophrenia patients showed reducedtask-related activation in the TPJ and the MPFC during the false belief conditioncompared with controls, but not for the false photograph condition. This pattern suggests that reduced activation in these regions is associated with, andspecific to, impaired ToM in schizophrenia.
 Xenomelia, the "foreign limb syndrome," is characterized by the non-acceptance ofone or more of one's own extremities and the resulting desire for elective limbamputation or paralysis. Formerly labeled "body integrity identity disorder"(BIID), the condition was originally considered a psychological or psychiatricdisorder, but a brain-centered Zeitgeist and a rapidly growing interest in theneural underpinnings of bodily self-consciousness has shifted the focus towarddysfunctional central nervous system circuits. The present article outlays bothmind-based and brain-based views highlighting their shortcomings. We propose thatfull insight into what should be conceived a "xenomelia spectrum disorder" willrequire interpretation of individual symptomatology in a social context. A propersocial neuroscience of xenomelia respects the functional neuroanatomy ofcorporeal awareness, but also acknowledges the brain's plasticity in response to an individual's history, which is lived against a cultural background. Thisintegrated view of xenomelia will promote the subfield of consciousness research concerned with the unity of body and self.
 Human social intelligence comprises a wide range of complex cognitive andaffective processes that appear to be selectively impaired in autistic spectrumdisorders. The study of these neuro-developmental disorders and the study ofcanonical social intelligence have advanced rapidly over the last twenty years byinvestigating the two together. Specifically, studies of autism have providedimportant insights into the nature of "theory of mind" abilities, their normaldevelopment and underlying neural systems. At the same time, the idea of impaireddevelopment of the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying "theory of mind" has shednew light on the nature of autistic disorders. This general approach is notrestricted to the study of impairments but extends to mapping areas of socialintelligence that are spared in autism. Here we investigate basic moral judgment and find that it appears to be substantially intact in children with autism whoare severely impaired in "theory of mind". At the same time, we extend studies ofmoral reasoning in normal development by way of a new control task, the "crybaby" task. Cry baby scenarios, in which the distress of the victim is"unreasonable" or "unjustified," do not elicit moral condemnation from normallydeveloping preschoolers or from children with autism. Judgments of moraltransgressions in which the victim displays distress are therefore not likely theresult of a simple automatic reaction to distress and more likely involve moralreasoning. Mapping the cognitive comorbidity patterns of disordered developmentmust encompass both impairments and sparings because both are needed to makesense of the neural and genetic levels.
 Character processing is a crucial cognitive skill that is highly emphasized andindustriously cultivated in contemporary society. In the present study, using acompetition paradigm, we examined the electrophysiological correlates ofdifferent relationships between Chinese characters and faces and between Chinese characters and houses during early visual processing. We observed thatidentifiable Chinese characters compete primarily with faces rather than housesat an early visual processing stage, with a significantly reduced N170 for faces but not for houses, when they were viewed concurrently with identifiablecharacters relative to when they were viewed concurrently with unidentifiablecharacters. Consistent with our previous study, there was a significant increase in N170 after characters have been learned, indicating a modulatory effect ofChinese character identification level on N170 amplitude. Furthermore, we foundan enlarged N170 in response to faces compared to houses, indicating that theneural mechanisms for processing faces and houses are different at an earlyvisual processing stage.
 Joint engagement (JE) is a state in which two people attend to a common target.By supporting an infant's attention to the target, JE promotes encoding ofinformation. This process has not been studied in toddlers despite the fact that language and social interaction develop rapidly in this period. We asked whether JE modulates object discrimination in typically developing toddlers. In a pilotevaluation of a novel, naturalistic paradigm, toddlers (n = 11) were introducedto toys by an examiner with or without JE. Toddlers then viewed images of thetoys while high-density electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Analysisfocused on the differential neural response to objects presented in the twoconditions. EEG components of interest included frontal positive component (Pb), negative component (Nc), and positive slow wave. Toddlers discriminated betweenconditions with a larger Pb peak amplitude to stimuli presented with JE and alarger Nc mean amplitude to the stimuli presented without JE, reflecting greater familiarity with the toys presented socially. Our findings suggest that JEsupports object learning in toddlers, and supports the potential utility of this novel paradigm in both the assessment and the potential to detect impairment insocial learning among toddlers.
 The amygdala plays a critical role in orienting gaze and attention to sociallysalient stimuli. Previous work has demonstrated that SM a patient with rarebilateral amygdala lesions, fails to fixate and make use of information from the eyes in faces. Amygdala dysfunction has also been implicated as a contributingfactor in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), consistent with some reports ofreduced eye fixations in ASD. Yet, detailed comparisons between ASD and patients with amygdala lesions have not been undertaken. Here we carried out such acomparison, using eye tracking to complex social scenes that contained faces. We presented participants with three task conditions. In the Neutral task,participants had to determine what kind of room the scene took place in. In theDescribe task, participants described the scene. In the Social Attention task,participants inferred where people in the scene were directing their attention.SM spent less time looking at the eyes and much more time looking at the mouthsthan control subjects, consistent with earlier findings. There was also a trendfor the ASD group to spend less time on the eyes, although this depended on theparticular image and task. Whereas controls and SM looked more at the eyes whenthe task required social attention, the ASD group did not. This pattern ofimpairments suggests that SM looks less at the eyes because of a failure instimulus-driven attention to social features, whereas individuals with ASD lookless at the eyes because they are generally insensitive to socially relevantinformation and fail to modulate attention as a function of task demands. Weconclude that the source of the social attention impairment in ASD may ariseupstream from the amygdala, rather than in the amygdala itself.
 Simulation theories argue that humans simulate motor processes of others to gain information about intentions and emotional states of others. Mu-suppression is a valid electrophysiological correlate of these processes. Mu-activity can bemeasured via electroencephalography (EEG) in the alpha-band (8-13 Hz) above thesensorimotor cortex and is suppressed when actions are executed or observed.Based on a within-subject design, including 28 participants, it was testedwhether the processes measured by mu-suppression could be modulated by empathictop-down-processes. Participants were asked to take the perspective of twoactors, telling a story about a sad or neutral life event (video sequences).Afterwards, EEG was measured at central (C3, Cz, C4) and occipital (O1, Oz, O2)electrodes, while participants observed the actors drinking water (standardizedvideo sequences, 8 s duration). Fast fourier transformation showed strongersuppression of power in the alpha-range (relative to baseline) at central andoccipital electrodes while the actor with the sad story was observed relative to the actor with the neutral story. Furthermore, measures of state empathycorrelated positively with the difference of mu-suppression between executed and observed movements, an indicator of self-other discrimination. Thus, mirrorneuron activity measured by mu-suppression is modulated by empathic processes.
 This study investigated in 2 experiments whether reflexive cuing of attentionthat occurs after perception of a gaze cue is greater for fearful than for happy faces in normal participants, as hypothesized from a social neuroscienceperspective. To increase neuroecological validity, dynamic stimulus presentation was used to display faces that simultaneously morphed from a neutral expressioninto a happy or fearful one and shifted eye gaze from the center to theperiphery. Shifts of attention resulting from a natural fearful gaze wereexpected to be related to participants' anxiety traits, in agreement with theoften found increased selective attention to threat in anxious participants. Bothhypotheses were confirmed: Fearful faces induced stronger gaze cuing than happyfaces, and the strength of this cuing effect was correlated to participants'anxiety levels. These results suggest a neural network, which integrates theprocessing of gaze, expression, and emotional states to adaptively primevigilance under threatening circumstances.
 The level of emotional timing deficit is a critical determinant of dailyfunctions and social interactions in people with schizophrenia. This studydemonstrated that people with schizophrenia have significant deficits inemotional time perception. Behaviorally, while the healthy controls overestimatedthe duration of happy and fearful faces, the patients underestimated the durationof emotional and neutral faces. Accordingly, an online ERP index of timing--thecontingent negative variation (CNV) displayed larger amplitudes for emotionalfaces in the controls, whereas the CNV in the patients only showed overallsmaller amplitudes when compared with the controls. In addition, the results ofthe N170 and the CNV suggest that the emotional processing and timing for facial expressions in schizophrenia might have a pattern of two-stage deterioration.Findings from the present work point to the importance of considering the timedimension of emotional processing in schizophrenia, based on which we are likely to discover aspects of emotional deficits that would be unnoticed in otherstudies. Furthermore, the perception deviation of the duration of emotional facesin schizophrenia suggests us to consider the magnitude of this temporal deviationas a quantitative biomarker for specific emotional/social dysfunctions inschizophrenia.
 Previous research has demonstrated that early attentional components of theevent-related potential (ERP) reflect differential attention to race duringperson perception. There is also evidence that inconsistency between stereotypic information following impression formation leads to greater neural processing in later ERP components. However, research has not examined how expectancyviolations following impression formation affect the early attentional processingof race. The current study examined this issue by leading White participants toform impressions of targets based on positive or negative behaviors associatedwith stereotypes about Blacks or Whites, with the purpose of creating anexpectation of Black or White targets. Following each impression formation trial,a target face whose race either violated or confirmed this expectancy wasdisplayed. Participants indicated whether this target could have performed theprevious behavior. Results demonstrated that reaction times and early attentionalcomponents of the ERP varied as a function of the match between expectancy andthe race of target faces, with stereotypic expectancy violating trials yieldinglonger reaction times and greater N1 and N2 amplitudes than expectancy-confirmingtrials. Implications for impression formation and person perception arediscussed.
 BACKGROUND: Self-generated thoughts (SGTs), such as during mind wandering, occupymuch of our waking life. Individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) areless in the "here and now" and prone to rumination. Few studies have looked atSGTs in depression using experience sampling methods and no study has so farinvestigated the specific contents of depressive SGTs and how they vary from one time point to another. METHODS: MDD patients (n=25) and matched healthy controls (n=26) performed an established mind wandering task, involving non-demandingnumber discriminations. Intermittent probe questions ask for participants'current SGTs, that is, how off-task the thoughts are, how positive or negative,self- or other-related, and past- or future-oriented. RESULTS: Multi-levelmodelling revealed that MDD patients engaged in more mind wandering than healthy controls. Their SGTs were predominantly negative and less positive, moreself-related and past-oriented. Strongest predictor of depressive SGT was thedecreased positive valence of thoughts. MDD patients' future and past-orientedthoughts were particularly more negative compared to healthy controls. Within MDDpatients, the less positively valenced thoughts they had and the less variablethese thoughts were, the more depressive symptoms they showed. LIMITATION: Noother measures of rumination and worry were used. CONCLUSION: MDD patients show avery specific SGT pattern, possibly reflecting ruminative and anxious thoughts.This SGT pattern in depression might represent a useful state marker and evenconstitute an etiological factor of this debilitating disease, considering theimportance of current SGT on and individual's cognitive processes and affectivestates.
 By nature, stereotypes require processes of categorization or semanticassociation, including social information about groups of people. There isempirical evidence that the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) processes domain-generalsemantic information, and supports social knowledge. A recent study showed thatinhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the ATL reducedracial stereotypes on an implicit association test (IAT). However, it was notdetermined whether this was caused by changes to specific social, or generalsemantic processing, or both. The current study addresses these theoreticalissues. The design investigated the effect of rTMS to the left or right ATL, or asham stimulation, on a social IAT (gender stereotypes), a non-social IAT (living versus non-living associations), and a non-semantic control (Stroop) task. Theresults showed that low-frequency rTMS to both left and right ATL significantlyreduced D-scores on the gender IAT compared to the sham group; however, therewere no differences on the non-social IAT or the Stroop. The findings show theATL has a role in mediating stereotypes, and the decrease of bias afterstimulation could be due to weakening of social stereotypical associations eitherwithin the ATL or via a network of brain regions connected with the ATL.
 Cross-cultural studies have shown that personality traits are less central andsocial identities are more important to the selfhood of collectivistic people.However, most cultural neuroscience studies using the self-reference effect (SRE)paradigm have only used personality traits to explore cultural differences in theneural circuits of self-referential processes. In the present study, we used bothpersonality traits and social identities as stimuli in the SRE paradigm andinvestigated whether and how one's cultural orientation (i.e., individualism vs. collectivism) affects the SRE in the brain. The results showed that the medialprefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, bilateral temporoparietal regions, andprecuneus were involved in self-representation for both personality traits andsocial identities. Importantly, cultural orientation predicted differentialactivation patterns in these regions. Collectivists showed stronger activation inthe left temporoparietal regions than individualists, who mainly recruited themedial prefrontal regions. Our findings suggest that the personal and social selfshare common neural substrates, the activation of which can be modulated by one'scultural orientation.
 Opioid tolerance and the potential for addiction is a significant burdenassociated with pain management, yet its precise underlying mechanism andprevention remain elusive. Immune signaling contributes to the decreased efficacyof opioids, and we recently demonstrated that Toll-like receptor 4(TLR4)-mediated neuroinflammation in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) drivestolerance. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a product of TLR4 signaling, promotesinflammation and facilitates glutamatergic signaling, key components of opioidtolerance. Therefore, we hypothesize that TLR4-mediated opioid tolerance requiresTNF signaling. By expression of a dominant-negative TNF peptide via lentiviralvector injection in rat PAG to sequester soluble TNF (solTNF), we demonstratethat solTNF mediates morphine tolerance induced by TLR4 signaling, stimulatesneuroinflammation (increased IL-1beta and TLR4 mRNA), and disrupts glutamatereuptake (decreased GLT-1 and GLAST mRNA). We further demonstrate the efficacy ofthe brain-permeant PEGylated version of the anti-solTNF peptide, XPro1595,injected systemically, to normalize morphine-induced CNS neuroinflammation andmorphine- and endotoxin-induced changes in glutamate transport, effectivelypreserving the efficacy of morphine analgesia and eliminating tolerance. Ourfindings provide a novel pharmacological target for the prevention ofopioid-induced immune signaling, tolerance, and addiction.
 It has been suggested that the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) is involved ininferring immediate goals and intentions from behaviors, whereas the medialprefrontal cortex (mPFC) integrates social information, such as traits, at a moreabstract level. To explore the differential role of the TPJ and mPFC,participants read several verbal descriptions about an agent. Embedded in afactorial design, in one-half of the trials (behavior condition), the agent wasengaged in a simple goal-directed behavior, whereas in the other half thisdescription was absent. In another half of the trials (trait condition), theparticipants had to answer a question about a trait of the agent, whereas in the other half the question was about the agent's physical appearance. The resultsrevealed that the dorsal mPFC was recruited when participants inferred theagent's trait, irrespective of a behavioral description. In contrast, the TPJ,posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), anterior intraparietal sulcus, andpremotor cortex were activated when goal-directed behavioral information waspresented, irrespective of a trait question. These findings confirm that in asocial context, the TPJ (and pSTS) is activated for understanding goal-directedbehaviors, whereas the mPFC is involved in processing traits.
 A polymorphism in the mu opioid receptor gene OPRM1 (rs1799971) has beeninvestigated for its role in sensitivity to social contexts. Evidence suggeststhat the G allele of this polymorphism is associated with higher levels ofsensitivity. This study tested for main effects of the polymorphism and itsinteraction with a self-report measure of childhood adversity as an index ofnegative environment. Outcomes were several personality measures relevant tosocial connection. Significant interactions were obtained, such that the negativeimpact of childhood adversity on personality was greater among G carriers thanamong A homozygotes on measures of agreeableness, interdependence, angerproneness, hostility, authentic pride, life engagement, and an index of (mostlynegative) feelings coloring one's world view. Findings support the role of OPRM1 in sensitivity to negative environments. Limitations are noted, including thelack of a measure of advantageous social environment to assess sensitivity topositive social contexts.
 IMPORTANCE: Several clinical reports have stated that patients with prefrontallesions or patients with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia share social cognition impairments. Moral reasoning is impaired in both conditions but there have been few investigations that directly compare this domain in the 2groups. OBSERVATIONS: This work compared the moral judgments of these patientgroups using a task designed to disentangle the contributions of intentions andoutcomes in moral judgment. For both disorders, patients judged scenarios wherethe protagonists believed that they would cause harm but did not as being morepermissible than the control group. Moreover, patients with frontotemporaldementia judged harmful outcomes in the absence of harmful intentions as lesspermissible than the control participants. There were no differences between the 2 conditions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Both disorders involved impairments inintegrating intention and outcome information for moral judgment. This study was the first, to our knowledge, to directly compare a social cognition domain in 2frontal pathologies with different etiology. Our results highlighted theimportance of comparing patients with vascular lesions and patients withneurodegenerative diseases.
 Reading other people's eyes is a valuable skill during interpersonal interaction.Although a number of studies have investigated visual patterns in relation to theperceiver's interest, intentions, and goals, little is known about eye gaze when it comes to differentiating intentions to love from intentions to lust (sexualdesire). To address this question, we conducted two experiments: one testingwhether the visual pattern related to the perception of love differs from thatrelated to lust and one testing whether the visual pattern related to theexpression of love differs from that related to lust. Our results show that aperson's eye gaze shifts as a function of his or her goal (love vs. lust) whenlooking at a visual stimulus. Such identification of distinct visual patterns forlove and lust could have theoretical and clinical importance in couples therapywhen these two phenomena are difficult to disentangle from one another on thebasis of patients' self-reports.
 The rise of molecular epigenetics over the last few years promises to bring thediscourse about the sociality and susceptibility to environmental influences ofthe brain to an entirely new level. Epigenetics deals with molecular mechanismssuch as gene expression, which may embed in the organism "memories" of socialexperiences and environmental exposures. These changes in gene expression may be transmitted across generations without changes in the DNA sequence. Epigeneticsis the most advanced example of the new postgenomic and context-dependent view ofthe gene that is making its way into contemporary biology. In my article I willuse the current emergence of epigenetics and its link with neuroscience research as an example of the new, and in a way unprecedented, sociality of contemporarybiology. After a review of the most important developments of epigeneticresearch, and some of its links with neuroscience, in the second part I reflecton the novel challenges that epigenetics presents for the social sciences for are-conceptualization of the link between the biological and the social in apostgenomic age. Although epigenetics remains a contested, hyped, and oftenuncritical terrain, I claim that especially when conceptualized in broadernon-genecentric frameworks, it has a genuine potential to reformulate theossified biology/society debate.
 We assessed political attitudes using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) inwhich participants were presented faces and names of well-known Democrat andRepublican politicians along with positive and negative words while undergoingfunctional MRI. We found a significant behavioral IAT effect for the face, butnot the name, condition. The fMRI face condition results indicated thatventromedial and anterior prefrontal cortices were activated during politicalattitude inducement. Amygdala and fusiform gyrus were activated during perceptualprocessing of familiar faces. Amygdala activation also was associated withmeasures of strength of emotion. Frontopolar activation was positively correlatedwith an implicit measure of bias and valence strength (how strongly theparticipants felt about the politicians), while strength of affiliation withpolitical party was negatively correlated with lateral PFC, lending support tothe idea that two distinct but interacting networks-one emphasizing rapid,stereotypic, and emotional associative knowledge and the other emphasizing moredeliberative and factual knowledge-cooperate in the processing of politicians.Our findings of ventromedial PFC activation suggests that when processing theassociative knowledge concerned with politicians, stereotypic knowledge isactivated, but in addition, the anterior prefrontal activations indicate thatmore elaborative, reflective knowledge about the politician is activated.
 We are called upon to make decisions, large and small, many times a day. Whether in the voting booth, the stock exchange, or the cafeteria line, we identifypotential options, estimate and compare their subjective values, and make achoice. Decision-making has only recently become a focus for cognitiveneuroscience. The last two decades have seen rapid progress in our understanding of the brain basis of at least some aspects of this rather complex aspect ofcognition. This work has provided fresh perspectives on poorly understood brainregions, such as orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum. It has led tointeresting interdisciplinary exchanges with diverse fields, notably economics,but also ecology and political science, among others. The novel perspectivesarising from these exchanges have begun to be related to better understoodaspects of cognition. In particular, it is increasingly clear thatdecision-making is tightly interlinked with learning and memory. Key earlyinsights in decision neuroscience came from what were essentially reinforcementlearning tasks. Recent work has made similar links to aspects of declarativememory. Indeed, decision-making can be seen as the link between memory of thepast and future actions. This chapter reviews selected topics in decisionneuroscience, with a particular focus on the links to learning and memory, and a particular emphasis on regions within prefrontal cortex.
 Neuroimaging studies have found a correlation between activation in the anterior insula and love, and a correlation between activation in the posterior insula andlust. The present control-case study describes a neurological male patient, with a rare, circumscribed lesion in the anterior insula, whom we tested using adecision task that required he judge whether each of a series of attractiveindividuals could be the object of his love or lust. The patient, in contrastwith neurologically typical participants matched on age, gender, and ethnicity,performed normally when making decisions about lust but showed a selectivedeficit when making decisions about love. These results provide the firstclinical evidence indicating that the anterior insula may play an instrumentalrole in love but not lust more generally. These data support the notion of aposterior-to-anterior insular gradient, from sensorimotor to abstractrepresentations, in the evaluation of anticipatory rewards in interpersonalrelationships.
 Our sense of self includes awareness of our thoughts and movements, and ourcontrol over them. This feeling can be altered or lost in neuropsychiatricdisorders as well as in phenomena such as "automatic writing" whereby writing is attributed to an external source. Here, we employed suggestion in highlyhypnotically suggestible participants to model various experiences of automaticwriting during a sentence completion task. Results showed that the induction ofhypnosis, without additional suggestion, was associated with a small butsignificant reduction of control, ownership, and awareness for writing. Targeted suggestions produced a double dissociation between thought and movementcomponents of writing, for both feelings of control and ownership, andadditionally, reduced awareness of writing. Overall, suggestion producedselective alterations in the control, ownership, and awareness of thought andmotor components of writing, thus enabling key aspects of automatic writing,observed across different clinical and cultural settings, to be modelled.
 The ability to think about oneself--to self--reflect--is one of the definingfeatures of the human mind. Recent research has suggested that this ability maybe subserved by a particular brain region: the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC).However, although humans can contemplate a variety of different aspects ofthemselves, including their stable personality traits, current feelings, andphysical attributes, no research has directly examined the extent to which these different forms of self-reflection are subserved by common mechanisms. To addressthis question, participants were scanned using functional magnetic resonanceimaging (fMRI) while making judgments about their own personality traits, currentmental states, and physical attributes as well as those of another person.Whereas some brain regions responded preferentially during only one form ofself-reflection, a robust region of MPFC was engaged preferentially duringself-reflection across all three types of judgment. These results suggestthat--although dissociable--diverse forms of self-referential thought draw on ashared cognitive process subserved by MPFC.
 Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is associated with long-term and negative effect on arousal regulation. Recent neuroimaging studies have examined brain mechanismsrelated to arousal dysregulation with cross-sectional experimental designs; butlongitudinal changes in the brain, reflecting group differences inneurodevelopment, have never been directly examined. To directly assess theinteraction of PCE and neurodevelopment, the present study used a longitudinaldesign to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collectedfrom 33 adolescents (21 with PCE and 12 non-exposed controls) while theyperformed the same working memory task with emotional distracters at two pointsin time. The mean age of participants was 14.3 years at time_1 and 16.7 years at time_2. With confounding factors statistically controlled, the fMRI data revealedsignificant exposure-by-time interaction in the activations of the amygdala anddefault mode network (DMN). For the control adolescents, brain activationsassociated with emotional arousal (amygdala) and cognitive effort (DMN) were bothreduced at time_2 as compared to that at time_1. However, these activationreductions were not observed in the PCE group, indicating persistently highlevels of emotional arousal and cognitive effort. In addition, correlationsbetween longitudinal changes in the brain and in behavior have shown thatadolescents with persistently high emotional arousal were more likely in need of high cognitive effort; and their cognitive performance was more likely to beaffected by distractive challenges. The present results complement and extendprevious findings from cross-sectional studies with further evidence supportingthe view of PCE associated long-term teratogenic effects on arousal regulation.
 Joint attention (JA) is a cornerstone of adaptive human social functioning.Little functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research has examined, ininteractive paradigms, neural activation underlying bids for JA, met with acongruent or an incongruent social response. We developed a highly naturalisticfMRI paradigm utilizing eye-tracking to create real-time, contingent socialresponses to participant-initiated JA. During congruent responses to JA bids, we observed increased activation in the right amygdala, the right fusiform gyrus,anterior and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices, striatum, ventral tegmentalarea, and posterior parietal cortices. Incongruent responses to JA bids elicited increased activity localized to the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) andbilateral cerebellum. No differences in eye-gaze patterns were observed duringcongruent or incongruent trials. Our results highlight the importance ofutilizing interactive fMRI paradigms in social neuroscience and the impact ofcongruency in recruiting integrated social, reward, and attention circuits forprocessing JA.
 The role of empathy in human social interaction has been examined in severalresearch fields, including medical education (ME) and social neuroscience (SN).SN yields insights into empathy based on neurobiological processes, and suchinformation may also be relevant to ME. In this reflection article, the authorsfirst critically review current definitions and concepts of empathy in ME andlink them to recent SN findings. In the light of recent evidence from SN,research in ME regarding the positive and negative effects of empathy forphysicians and patients is discussed, as well as the question whether (future)physicians differ from the general population with regard to empathic skills.Commonly used SN paradigms and ME approaches to assess empathy are contrasted, a joint approach is advocated, and implications for further interdisciplinarystudies are outlined. Finally, the authors delineate the contribution of SN tothe question of whether empathy is teachable, and argue that SN findingsrepresent a potential for new ME training approaches. In conclusion, the authors discuss how the incorporation of perspectives on empathy from different research areas would benefit ME, and suggest the translation and integration of suchfindings into ME research approaches.
 Morality and empathy are fundamental components of human nature across cultures. However, the wealth of empirical findings from developmental, behavioral, andsocial neuroscience demonstrates a complex relation between morality and empathy.At times, empathy guides moral judgment, yet other times empathy can interferewith it. To better understand such relations, we propose abandoning the catchall term of empathy in favor of more precise concepts, such as emotional sharing,empathic concern, and affective perspective-taking.
 Introduction: Although, diet has a substantial influence on the aging brain, the relationship between dietary nutrients and aspects of brain health remainsunclear. This study examines the neural mechanisms that mediate the relationship between a carotenoid important for brain health across the lifespan, lutein, and crystallized intelligence in cognitively intact older adults. We hypothesizedthat higher serum levels of lutein are associated with better performance on atask of crystallized intelligence, and that this relationship is mediated by graymatter structure of regions within the temporal cortex. This investigation aimsto contribute to a growing line of evidence, which suggests that particularnutrients may slow or prevent aspects of cognitive decline by targeting specific features of brain aging. Methods: We examined 76 cognitively intact adultsbetween the ages of 65 and 75 to investigate the relationship between serumlutein, tests of crystallized intelligence (measured by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence), and gray matter volume of regions within the temporalcortex. A three-step mediation analysis was implemented using multivariate linearregressions to control for age, sex, education, income, depression status, andbody mass index. Results: The mediation analysis revealed that gray matterthickness of one region within the temporal cortex, the right parahippocampalcortex (Brodmann's Area 34), partially mediates the relationship between serumlutein and crystallized intelligence. Conclusion: These results suggest that the parahippocampal cortex acts as a mediator of the relationship between serumlutein and crystallized intelligence in cognitively intact older adults. Priorfindings substantiate the individual relationships reported within the mediation,specifically the links between (i) serum lutein and temporal cortex structure,(ii) serum lutein and crystallized intelligence, and (iii) parahippocampal cortexstructure and crystallized intelligence. This report demonstrates a novelstructural mediation between lutein status and crystallized intelligence, andtherefore provides further evidence that specific nutrients may slow or preventfeatures of cognitive decline by hindering particular aspects of brain aging.Future work should examine the potential mechanisms underlying this mediation,including the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and membrane modulating properties of lutein.
 Using event-related potentials (ERPs), this study examines how trait information inferred from behaviors is associated with person names. In linguisticdiscourses, person names were associated with descriptions of either positive or negative behaviors. In a subsequent explicit evaluation task, the previouslydescribed person names were presented in isolation, and the participants wereasked to judge the emotional valence of these names. We found that the namesassociated with positive descriptions elicited a larger positivity in the ERPthan the names associated with negative descriptions. The results indicate thatthe emotional valence of person names attached to person perception can bedynamically influenced by short descriptions of the target person, probably dueto trait inference based on the provided behavioral descriptions.
 Decision neuroscience suggests that there exists a core network for thesubjective valuation of rewards from a range of different domains, encompassingthe ventral striatum and regions of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), in particularthe ventromedial aspect of the OFC. Here we first review ways to measuresubjective value experimentally in a cognitive neuroscience context, and provide a brief overview over different types of value (outcome, goal and decisionvalue). We then compare results of functional neuroimaging studies of subjective value representations across these different types of value. Our analysissuggests that the same region of the mOFC represents the outcome values ofprimary reinforcers, but also more complex decision values in which multipledimensions of the reward need to be integrated. The subjective (hedonic)experience of processing highly valued decision options (regardless of whetherthey refer to actually experienced rewards or merely potential future rewards)appears to be what is reflected in value-related mOFC activity.
 BACKGROUND: There has been no study conducted about the effect of autosuggestion on quality of life for geriatric patients. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacyof autosuggestion for geriatric patients' quality of life and its impact onpsycho-neuro-endocrine-immune pathway. METHODS: Sixty geriatric patients aged>/=60 years in a ward were randomly assigned to either receive autosuggestion or not. Autosuggestion was recorded in a tape to be heard daily for 30 days. Bothgroups received the standard medical therapy. Primary outcome was quality of lifeby COOP chart. Secondary outcomes were serum cortisol level, interleukin-2,interleukin-6, interferon-gamma, and N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio inlimbic/paralimbic system by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The study was singleblinded due to the nature of the intervention studied. RESULTS: Out of 60subjects, 51 finished the study. The autosuggestion group reported better scores than the control one for quality of life, COOP chart 1.95 vs. 2.22 (95% CI, p =0.02). There were increments of serum cortisol (p = 0.03) and interleukin-6 inthe autosuggestion group (p = 0.04). Interleukin-2, interferon-gamma, andN-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio in prefrontal cortex showed a tendency toincrease in the autosuggestion groups. CONCLUSION: Autosuggestion is associatedwith improvement of geriatrics' quality of life, serum cortisol level, andadaptive immunity. There is a better trend for neuroplasticity in prefrontalcortex in the autosuggestion group.
 Perceptions of intergroup threat have been related to both experiences ofphysiological stress responses and derogation of the outgroup. In this study, aneuroscience perspective was used to investigate the relationship between stress and opportunity to derogate the outgroup, in a threatening intergroup context.Research from a social identity perspective suggests that engaging in outgroupderogation alleviates stress when perceiving an intergroup threat. However, inline with the model of intergroup anxiety, opportunity to derogate couldexacerbate the negative connotations of a threatening situation, resulting inmore stress. Canadian participants (N = 110) were exposed to text describingeither discriminatory or favorable comments expressed by Chinese individualstowards Canadians. Half of the participants were given the opportunity toderogate via a bias task. Salivary cortisol was used as a measure of stress andwas collected at baseline, post-threat, and post-derogation. As expected,threatening identity led to more stress as evidenced by increased cortisolconcentrations. Furthermore, threatened participants who had an opportunity toderogate showed greater cortisol concentrations than those who did not. Theseresults demonstrate a link between stress and the opportunity to derogate, andhighlights the value of using biological markers within the intergroup context.Rewrite abstract to remove all the references (they are meaningless because theabstracting services will use the abstract as is but will not provide thereferences so their presence is useless.
 Pain elicits behaviors in humans and nonhuman animals that serve as social cues. Pain behaviors serve a communicative function in humans, and this may be true as well in other animals. This review considers the current evidence for modulation of acute pain in different social contexts in humans and rodents, with a focus ondyadic social interactions. Increasing data supports the ability of socialbuffering, emotional contagion (a form of empathy), vicarious learning, andsocial stress to modulate pain sensitivity and pain behavior in mice and rats. Asin humans, many of these social factors operate, and affect pain, in asex-dependent manner. The development of a true social neuroscience of pain, withdetailed explication of the underlying neurochemistry and genetics, now seemsachievable.
 In a recent experiment with functional magnetic-resonance imaging, we found that brain activity in the extrastriate body area (EBA) distinguished between observedself- and other-generated movements, being significantly higher duringobservation of someone else's movement. Here, we investigated further the role ofEBA in self-other distinctions using low-frequency repetitive transcranialmagnetic stimulation (rTMS). As compared with rTMS applied over a control site,rTMS applied over the EBA increased reaction times, without affecting accuracy,for the detection of other-generated movements. Performance on a controlmotion-direction detection task was unaffected. These findings provide additionalevidence for the role of the EBA in processing information necessary foridentifying ourselves as agents of self-generated movements.
 BACKGROUND: The prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) is an emerging animal modelfor biomedical research because of its rich sociobehavioral repertoire. Recently,lentiviral transgenic technology has been used to introduce the gene encoding thegreen fluorescent protein (GFP) into the prairie vole germline. However, theefficiency of transgenesis in this species is limited by the inability toreliably produce large numbers of fertilized embryos. Here we examined severalfactors that may contribute to variability in superovulation success including,age and parentage of the female, and latency to mating after being placed withthe male. METHODS: Females produced from 5 genetically distinct breeder lineswere treated with 100 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) andimmediately housed with a male separated by a perforated Plexiglas divider.Ovulation was induced 72 hr later with 30 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin(hCG) and 2 hrs later mating was allowed. RESULTS: Superovulation was mostefficient in young females. For example, females aged 6-11 weeks produced moreembryos (14 +/- 1.4 embryos) as compared to females aged 12-20 weeks (4 +/- 1.6embryos). Females aged 4-5 weeks did not produce embryos. Further, females thatmated within 15 min of male exposure produced significantly more embryos thanthose that did not. Interestingly, there was a significant effect of parentage.For example, 12 out of 12 females from one breeder pair superovulated (defined asproducing 5 or more embryos), while only 2 out of 10 females for other linessuperovulated. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this work suggest that age and geneticbackground of the female are the most important factors contributing tosuperovulation success and that latency to mating is a good predictor of thenumber of embryos to be recovered. Surprisingly we found that cohabitation withthe male prior to mating is not necessary for the recovery of embryos but isnecessary to recover oocytes. This information will dramatically reduce thenumber of females required to generate embryos for transgenesis in this species.
 The present research explored the cortical correlates of emotional memories inresponse to words and pictures. Subjects' performance (Accuracy Index, AI;response times, RTs; RTs/AI) was considered when a repetitive TranscranialMagnetic Stimulation (rTMS) was applied on the left dorsolateral prefrontalcortex (LDLPFC). Specifically, the role of LDLPFC was tested by performing amemory task, in which old (previously encoded targets) and new (previously notencoded distractors) emotional pictures/words had to be recognized. Valence(positive vs. negative) and arousing power (high vs. low) of stimuli were alsomodulated. Moreover, subjective evaluation of emotional stimuli in terms ofvalence/arousal was explored. We found significant performance improving (higher AI, reduced RTs, improved general performance) in response to rTMS. This "better recognition effect" was only related to specific emotional features, that ispositive high arousal pictures or words. Moreover no significant differences werefound between stimulus categories. A direct relationship was also observedbetween subjective evaluation of emotional cues and memory performance when rTMS was applied to LDLPFC. Supported by valence and approach model of emotions, wesupposed that a left lateralized prefrontal system may induce a betterrecognition of positive high arousal words, and that evaluation of emotional cue is related to prefrontal activation, affecting the recognition memories ofemotions.
 Recent studies have shown the existence of a relationship between sleep and moraljudgment. In this study, we investigated whether one night of sleep deprivationaffects the ability to judge the appropriateness of moral dilemmas. Forty-eightstudents had to judge 30 moral dilemmas at test, after a night of home sleep, andanother 30 dilemmas at retest, following one night of continuous wakefulness. The60 dilemmas (20 moral impersonal, 20 moral personal, and 20 non-moral) wereselected from Greene's dilemmas. Both groups judged the appropriateness ofpersonal and impersonal dilemmas in the same way. A close to significant effectof sleep deprivation was observed on the reaction times for impersonal moraldilemmas, to which the deprived subjects responded faster (p = .05) than thecontrol subjects. However, this was not the case for personal ones, for which no difference was significant. This result shows a greater ease/speed in responding to the (impersonal) dilemmas, which induce low emotional engagement after sleepdeprivation, although the willingness to accept moral violations is not affected.This suggests that one night of sleep loss selectively influences the responsespeed only for moral impersonal dilemmas, probably due to disinhibitionprocesses. The quality of moral judgment dilemmas does not seem to be easilyinfluenced by a single night of sleep deprivation, but only by a longer lack ofsleep.
 This study examines the relationship between autonomic functioning andneuropathology following cardiac arrest (CA) in mice. Within 24 h of CA,parasympathetic cardiac control, as indexed by high frequency (HF) heart ratevariability, rapidly decreases. By day 7 after CA, HF heart rate variability was inversely correlated with neuronal damage and microglial activation in thehippocampus. Thus, by virtue of its sensitivity to central insult, HF heart rate variability may offer an inexpensive, non-invasive method of monitoringneuropathological processes following CA. The inverse linear relationshipsbetween heart rate variability and brain damage after CA also may partiallyexplain why low heart rate variability is associated with increased morbidity andmortality in myocardial infarction patients.
 Prediction error, the difference between an expected and an actual outcome,serves as a learning signal that interacts with reward and punishment value todirect future behavior during reinforcement learning. We hypothesized thatsimilar learning and valuation signals may underlie social expectancy violations.Here, we explore the neural correlates of social expectancy violation signalsalong the universal person-perception dimensions trait warmth and competence. In this context, social learning may result from expectancy violations that occurwhen a target is inconsistent with an a priori schema. Expectancy violation mayactivate neural regions normally implicated in prediction error and valuationduring appetitive and aversive conditioning. Using fMRI, we first gave perceivershigh warmth or competence behavioral information that led to dispositional orsituational attributions for the behavior. Participants then saw pictures ofpeople responsible for the behavior; they represented social groups eitherinconsistent (rated low on either warmth or competence) or consistent (rated highon either warmth or competence) with the behavior information. Warmth andcompetence expectancy violations activate striatal regions that representevaluative and prediction error signals. Social cognition regions underlieconsistent expectations. These findings suggest that regions underlyingreinforcement learning may work in concert with social cognition regions inwarmth and competence social expectancy. This study illustrates the neuraloverlap between neuroeconomics and social neuroscience.
 How specialized is the infant brain for processing voice within our environment? Research in adults suggests that portions of the temporal lobe play an important role in differentiating vocalizations from other environmental sounds; however,very little is known about this process in infancy. Recent research in infantshas revealed discrepancies in the cortical location of voice-selectiveactivation, as well as the age of onset of this response. The current study used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to further investigate voiceprocessing in awake 4-7-month-old infants. In listening to voice and non-voicesounds, there was robust and widespread activation in bilateral temporal cortex. Further, voice-selective regions of the bilateral anterior temporal cortexevidenced a steady increase in voice selective activation (voice > non-voiceactivation) over 4-7 months of age. These findings support a growing body ofevidence that the emergence of cerebral specialization for human voice soundsevolves over the first 6 months of age.
 Given that presence is ineffable yet real and universal, it is no surprise thatit has historically been the domain of mystics. However, presence and itscousins-shared mind, love, and compassion-have now become of intense interestamong members of the scientific community under the banners of interpersonalneurobiology and social neuroscience (Decety & Lamm, 2009; Epstein & Street,2011; Klimecki, Leiberg, Lamm, & Singer, 2013; Zlatev, Racine, Sinha, & Itkonen, 2008). This may seem obvious to readers of Families Systems, and Health, but itis not the basis for medical practice or psychotherapy in general.
 Decision-making often involves choices between different stimuli, each of whichis associated with a different physical action. A growing consensus suggests thatthe brain makes such decisions by assigning a value to each available option and then comparing them to make a choice. An open question in decision neuroscienceis whether the brain computes these choices by comparing the values of stimulidirectly in goods space or instead by first assigning values to the associatedactions and then making a choice over actions. We used a functional MRI paradigm in which human subjects made choices between different stimuli with and withoutknowledge of the actions required to obtain the different stimuli. We foundneural correlates of the value of the chosen stimulus (a postdecision signal) in ventromedial prefrontal cortex before the actual stimulus-action pairing wasrevealed. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that the brain iscapable of making choices in the space of goods without first transferring valuesinto action space.
 OBJECTIVE: The establishment of an accurate understanding of one's social contextis a central developmental task during adolescence. A critical component of such development is to learn how to integrate the objective evaluation of one'sbehavior with the social response to the latter--here referred to as socialfeedback processing. CASE REPORT: We measured brain activity by means of fMRI in 33 healthy adolescents (12-19 years old, 14 females). Participants played adifficult perceptual game with integrated verbal and visual feedback. Verbalfeedback provided the participants with objective performance evaluation (won vs.lost). Visual feedback consisted of either smiling or angry faces, representingpositive or negative social evaluations. Together, the combination of verbal and visual feedback gave rise to congruent versus incongruent social feedbackcombinations. In addition to assessing sex differences, we further tested for theeffects of age and attachment style on social feedback processing. Resultsrevealed that brain activity during social feedback processing was significantly modulated by sex, age, and attachment style in prefrontal cortical areas, ventralanterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, caudate, and amygdala/hippocampus. Wefound indication for heightened activity during incongruent social feedbackprocessing in females, older participants, and individuals with an anxiousattachment style. Conversely, we observed stronger activity during processing of congruent social feedback in males and participants with an avoidant attachmentstyle. CONCLUSION: Our findings not only extend knowledge on the typicaldevelopment of socio-emotional brain function during adolescence, but alsoprovide first clues on how attachment insecurities, and particularly attachmentavoidance, could interfere with the latter mechanisms.
 This study investigated the electrophysiological (event-related potential, ERP)and behavioral (reaction time, RT) correlates of gaze-cued shifts of visuospatialattention. Participants viewed centrally presented faces with neutral expressionsin which eyes looked straight ahead and then shifted to the left or right. Uponmovement of the eyes, the facial expression either stayed the same (neutral) orchanged to a fearful or happy expression. Participants' task was to identify aprobe letter (T or L), which appeared in either the same or the opposite locationto the direction of the eye gaze. There was behavioral evidence of a gazecongruency effect, as RTs were faster when the eyes looked toward rather thanaway from the location of the target. The ERP data indicated the presence of asignificant gaze-congruent anterior directing attention negativity (ADAN) atanterior locations (300-500 ms after the onset of the gaze cue). ERP data did notshow evidence of initial orienting of attention triggered by gaze cues in theearly directing attention negativity (EDAN) at posterior locations (200-300 mspost-cue onset). The gaze cueing effects in the RT and ERP data were notsignificantly influenced by the emotional expression of the faces. The presenceof the ADAN may reflect neural mechanisms that underlie the holding of attention on gazed-at locations.
 Previous functional imaging studies have shown key roles of the dorsal anteriorinsula (dAI) and anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) in empathy for the sufferingof others. The current study mapped structural covariance networks of theseregions and assessed the relationship between networks and individual differencesin empathic responding in 94 females. Individual differences in empathy wereassessed through average state measures in response to a video task showingothers' suffering, and through questionnaire-based trait measures of empathicconcern. Overall, covariance patterns indicated that dAI and aMCC are principalhubs within prefrontal, temporolimbic, and midline structural covariancenetworks. Importantly, participants with high empathy state ratings showedincreased covariance of dAI, but not aMCC, to prefrontal and limbic brainregions. This relationship was specific for empathy and could not be explained byindividual differences in negative affect ratings. Regarding questionnaire-based empathic trait measures, we observed a similar, albeit weaker modulation of dAIcovariance, confirming the robustness of our findings. Our analysis, thus,provides novel evidence for a specific contribution of frontolimbic structuralcovariance networks to individual differences in social emotions beyond negative affect.
 Since the discovery of the mirror neuron system in the 1980s, little, if any,research has been devoted to the study of interactive motor tasks (Goldman,2012). Scientists interested in the neuropsychophysiological markers of jointmotor action have relied on observation paradigms and passive tasks rather thandynamic paradigms and interactive tasks (Konvalinka and Roepstorff, 2012). Withinthis research scenario, we introduce a novel research paradigm that usescooperative juggling as a platform to capture peripheral (e.g., skin conductance,breathing and heart rates, electromyographic signals) and centralneuropsychophysiological (e.g., functional connectivity within and betweenbrains) markers underlying the notion of team mental models (TMM). We discuss theepistemological and theoretical grounds of a cooperative juggling paradigm, andpropose testable hypotheses on neuropsychophysiological markers underlying TMM.Furthermore, we present key methodological concerns that may influence peripheralresponses as well as single and hyperbrain network configurations during jointmotor action. Preliminary findings of the paradigm are highlighted. We concludeby delineating avenues for future research.
 Interpersonal synchrony is characterized by a temporary alignment of periodicbehaviors with another person. This process requires that at least one of the twoindividuals monitors and adjusts his/her movements to maintain alignment with theother individual (the referent). Interestingly, recent research on interpersonal synchrony has found that people who are motivated to befriend an unfamiliarsocial referent tend to automatically synchronize with their social referents,raising the possibility that synchrony may be employed as an affiliation tool. Itis unknown, however, whether the opposite is true; that is, whether the personserving as the referent of interpersonal synchrony perceives synchrony withhis/her partner or experiences affiliative feelings toward the partner. Toaddress this question, we performed a series of studies on interpersonalsynchrony with a total of 100 participants. In all studies, participants servedas the referent with no requirement to monitor or align their behavior with theirpartners. Unbeknown to the participants, the timings of their "partner's"movements were actually determined by a computer program based on theparticipant's (i.e., referent's) behavior. Overall, our behavioral results showedthat the referent of a synchrony task expressed greater perceived synchrony andgreater social affiliation toward a synchronous partner (i.e., one displaying lowmean asynchrony and/or a narrow asynchrony range) than with an asynchronouspartner (i.e., one displaying high mean asynchrony and/or high asynchrony range).Our neuroimaging study extended these results by demonstrating involvement ofbrain areas implicated in social cognition, embodied cognition, self-otherexpansion, and action observation as correlates of interpersonal synchrony (vs.asynchrony). These findings have practical implications for social interactionand theoretical implications for understanding interpersonal synchrony and socialcoordination.
 The perceptual-attentional limitation hypothesis posits that the confusionbetween emotional facial expressions of fear and surprise may be due to theirvisual similarity, with shared muscle movements. In Experiment 1 full face imagesof fear and surprise varying as a function of distinctiveness (mouth index, brow index, or both indices) were displayed in a gender oddball task. Experiment 2, ina similar task, directed attention toward the eye or mouth region with a blurringtechnique. The current two studies used response time and event-relatedpotentials (ERP) to test the perceptual-attentional limitation hypothesis. While ERP results for Experiment 1 suggested that individuals may not have perceived a difference between the emotional expressions in any of the conditions, responsetime results suggested that individuals processed a difference between fear andsurprise when a distinctive cue was in the mouth. With directed attention inExperiment 2, ERP results indicated that individuals were capable of detecting a difference in all the conditions. In effect, the current two experiments suggest that participants display difficulty in distinguishing the prototypes of fear andsurprise with the eye region, which may be due to a lack of attention to thatregion, providing support for the attentional limitation hypothesis.
 Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies show that actionobservation facilitates the onlooker's cortico-spinal system supporting thenotion of motor mirroring. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)over ventral premotor cortex (vPMc) impairs visual discrimination of bodyactions. Although studies suggest that the action observation-execution matching system may map only actions that belong to the observer's motor repertoire, wedemonstrated comparable motor and premotor facilitation during observation ofbiomechanically possible as well as impossible actions. It has also been shownthat seeing impossible body movements activates the extrastriate body area (EBA).Using event-related rTMS, we sought to determine whether vPMc and EBA areactively involved in the visual discrimination of actions performed throughbiomechanically possible or impossible kinematics and of their biomechanicalplausibility. Stimulation of vPMc impaired discrimination of possible actionswhile leaving intact the discrimination of biomechanically impossible actions andof biomechanical plausibility. No effect of EBA rTMS on any type of actionprocessing was found. Thus, vPMc is crucial for discrimination of the goal ofactions that can be actually performed suggesting that this area is involved inthe visual processing of goal-directed actions.
 In the previous issue of Social Neuroscience, Lloyd-Fox and colleagues ( 2012 )provide evidence that voice-sensitivity in temporal cortex emerges between 4 and 7 months of age. We discuss the implications of these findings and the overallprogress that has been made in understanding the development of voice processing in infancy. In this commentary, we also examine important methodological andtheoretical issues raised by this new work in the emerging field of developmentalsocial neuroscience.
 Recent studies have shown that perceiving the pain of others activates brainregions in the observer associated with both somatosensory andaffective-motivational aspects of pain, principally involving regions of theanterior cingulate and anterior insula cortex. The degree of these empathicneural responses is modulated by racial bias, such that stronger neuralactivation is elicited by observing pain in people of the same racial groupcompared with people of another racial group. The aim of the present study was toexamine whether a more general social group category, other than race, couldsimilarly modulate neural empathic responses and perhaps account for the apparentracial bias reported in previous studies. Using a minimal group paradigm, weassigned participants to one of two mixed-race teams. We use the term race torefer to the Chinese or Caucasian appearance of faces and whether the ethnicgroup represented was the same or different from the appearance of theparticipant' own face. Using fMRI, we measured neural empathic responses asparticipants observed members of their own group or other group, and members oftheir own race or other race, receiving either painful or non-painful touch.Participants showed clear group biases, with no significant effect of race, onbehavioral measures of implicit (affective priming) and explicit groupidentification. Neural responses to observed pain in the anterior cingulatecortex, insula cortex, and somatosensory areas showed significantly greateractivation when observing pain in own-race compared with other-race individuals, with no significant effect of minimal groups. These results suggest that racialbias in neural empathic responses is not influenced by minimal forms of groupcategorization, despite the clear association participants showed with in-groupmore than out-group members. We suggest that race may be an automatic andunconscious mechanism that drives the initial neural responses to observed painin others.
 The ability to share the other's feelings, known as empathy, has recently become the focus of social neuroscience studies. We review converging evidence thatempathy with, for example, the pain of another person, activates part of theneural pain network of the empathizer, without first hand pain stimulation to theempathizer's body. The amplitude of empathic brain responses is modulated by the intensity of the displayed emotion, the appraisal of the situation,characteristics of the suffering person such as perceived fairness, and features of the empathizer such as gender or previous experience with pain-inflictingsituations. Future studies in the field should address inter-individualdifferences in empathy, development and plasticity of the empathic brain over thelife span, and the link between empathy, compassionate motivation, and prosocial behavior.
 The aim of this review is to highlight an emerging field: the neuroscience ofculture. This new field links cross-cultural psychology with cognitiveneuroscience across fundamental domains of cognitive and social psychology. Wepresent a summary of studies on emotion, perspective-taking, memory, objectperception, attention, language, and the self, showing cultural differences inbehavior as well as in neural activation. Although it is still nascent, the broadimpact of merging the study of culture with cognitive neuroscience holds mutualdistributed benefits for multiple related fields. Thus, cultural neuroscience maybe uniquely poised to provide insights and breakthroughs for longstandingquestions and problems in the study of behavior and thought, and its capacity forintegration across multiple levels of analysis is especially high. These findingsattest to the plasticity of the brain and its adaptation to cultural contexts.
 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by substantial social deficits.The notion that dysfunctions in neural circuits involved in sharing another'saffect explain these deficits is appealing, but has received only modestexperimental support. Here we evaluated a complex paradigm on the vicarioussocial pain of embarrassment to probe social deficits in ASD as to whether it is more potent than paradigms currently in use. To do so we acquired pupillometryand fMRI in young adults with ASD and matched healthy controls. During a simplevicarious physical pain task no differences emerged between groups in behavior,pupillometry, and neural activation of the anterior insula (AIC) and anteriorcingulate cortex (ACC). In contrast, processing complex vicarious social painyielded reduced responses in ASD on all physiological measures of sharinganother's affect. The reduced activity within the AIC was thereby explained bythe severity of autistic symptoms in the social and affective domain.Additionally, behavioral responses lacked correspondence with the anteriorcingulate and anterior insula cortex activity found in controls. Instead,behavioral responses in ASD were associated with hippocampal activity. Theobserved dissociation echoes the clinical observations that deficits in ASD aremost pronounced in complex social situations and simple tasks may not probe thedysfunctions in neural pathways involved in sharing affect. Our results arehighly relevant because individuals with ASD may have preserved abilities toshare another's physical pain but still have problems with the vicariousrepresentation of more complex emotions that matter in life.
 The display of antisocial behaviors in children and adolescents has been ofinterest to criminologists and developmental psychologists for years. Exposure tosocial adversity is a well-documented predictor of antisocial behavior.Additionally, measures of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, includingheart rate variability (HRV), pre-ejection period (PEP), and heart rate, havebeen associated with antisocial behaviors including rule-breaking and aggression.Social neuroscience research has begun to investigate how neurobiologicalunderpinnings affect the relationship between social adversity andantisocial/psychopathic behavior in children and adolescents. This studyinvestigated the potential mediating effects of ANS activity on the relationship between social adversity and antisocial behavior in a group of 7- to 10-year-old children from the community (N = 339; 48.2% male). Moderated multiple mediationanalyses revealed that low resting heart rate, but not PEP or HRV, mediated therelationship between social adversity and antisocial behavior in males only.Social adversity but not ANS measures were associated with antisocial behavior infemales. Findings have implications for understanding the neural influences that underlie antisocial behavior, illustrate the importance of the social environmentregarding the expression of these behaviors, and highlight essential genderdifferences.
 Accumulating neuroscience evidence indicates that human intelligence is supportedby a distributed network of frontal and parietal regions that enable complex,goal-directed behaviour. However, the contributions of this network to socialaspects of intellectual function remain to be well characterized. Here, we reporta human lesion study (n = 144) that investigates the neural bases of socialproblem solving (measured by the Everyday Problem Solving Inventory) and examine the degree to which individual differences in performance are predicted by abroad spectrum of psychological variables, including psychometric intelligence(measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale), emotional intelligence(measured by the Mayer, Salovey, Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test), andpersonality traits (measured by the Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness PersonalityInventory). Scores for each variable were obtained, followed by voxel-basedlesion-symptom mapping. Stepwise regression analyses revealed that workingmemory, processing speed, and emotional intelligence predict individualdifferences in everyday problem solving. A targeted analysis of specific everydayproblem solving domains (involving friends, home management, consumerism, work,information management, and family) revealed psychological variables thatselectively contribute to each. Lesion mapping results indicated that socialproblem solving, psychometric intelligence, and emotional intelligence aresupported by a shared network of frontal, temporal, and parietal regions,including white matter association tracts that bind these areas into acoordinated system. The results support an integrative framework forunderstanding social intelligence and make specific recommendations for theapplication of the Everyday Problem Solving Inventory to the study of socialproblem solving in health and disease.
 Empathy is the ability to experience and understand what others feel withoutconfusion between oneself and others. Knowing what someone else is feeling plays a fundamental role in interpersonal interactions. In this paper, we articulateevidence from social psychology and cognitive neuroscience, and argue thatempathy involves both emotion sharing (bottom-up information processing) andexecutive control to regulate and modulate this experience (top-down information processing), underpinned by specific and interacting neural systems. Furthermore,awareness of a distinction between the experiences of the self and othersconstitutes a crucial aspect of empathy. We discuss data from recent behavioraland functional neuroimaging studies with an emphasis on the perception of pain inothers, and highlight the role of different neural mechanisms that underpin theexperience of empathy, including emotion sharing, perspective taking, and emotionregulation.
 Abstract A consensus emerging from neuroscience is that certain brain regionsshow activity correlated with stimulus independent (e.g. private) consciousthought and yet are also implicated in public social processes. The fact thatsystems supporting social processing also exhibit activity with no obviousperceptual referent, can be seen as support for the framework suggested byGraziano and Kerber (this volume) once it is recognized that the property ofstimulus independence is also an important feature of consciousness.Understanding the social basis behind private stimulus independent thought,therefore, may provide an important assessment of the validity of the Grazianoand Kerber hypothesis.
 Reinforcement learning is an adaptive process in which an animal utilizes itsprevious experience to improve the outcomes of future choices. Computationaltheories of reinforcement learning play a central role in the newly emergingareas of neuroeconomics and decision neuroscience. In this framework, actions arechosen according to their value functions, which describe how much future reward is expected from each action. Value functions can be adjusted not only throughreward and penalty, but also by the animal's knowledge of its currentenvironment. Studies have revealed that a large proportion of the brain isinvolved in representing and updating value functions and using them to choose anaction. However, how the nature of a behavioral task affects the neuralmechanisms of reinforcement learning remains incompletely understood. Futurestudies should uncover the principles by which different computational elementsof reinforcement learning are dynamically coordinated across the entire brain.
 Cultural neuroscience is set to flourish in the next few years. As the fielddevelops, it is necessary to reflect on what is meant by 'culture' and how thiscan be translated for the laboratory context. This article uses the example ofthe adolescent brain to discuss three aspects of culture that may help us toshape and reframe questions, interpretations and applications in culturalneuroscience: cultural contingencies of categories, cultural differences inexperience and cultural context of neuroscience research. The last few years haveseen a sudden increase in the study of adolescence as a period of both structuraland functional plasticity, with new brain-based explanations of teenage behaviourbeing taken up in education, policy and medicine. However, the concept ofadolescence, as an object of behavioural science, took shape relatively recently,not much more than a hundred years ago and was shaped by a number of cultural andhistorical factors. Moreover, research in anthropology and cross-culturalpsychology has shown that the experience of adolescence, as a period of thelifespan, is variable and contingent upon culture. The emerging field of culturalneuroscience has begun to tackle the question of cultural differences in socialcognitive processing in adults. In this article, I explore what a culturalneuroscience can mean in the case of adolescence. I consider how to integrateperspectives from social neuroscience and anthropology to conceptualize, and toempirically study, adolescence as a culturally variable phenomenon, which,itself, has been culturally constructed.
 Self-recognition, being indispensable for successful social communication, hasbecome a major focus in current social neuroscience. The physical aspects of the self are most typically manifested in the face and voice. Compared with thewealth of studies on self-face recognition, self-voice recognition (SVR) has not gained much attention. Converging evidence has suggested that the fundamentalfrequency (F0) and formant structures serve as the key acoustic cues forother-voice recognition (OVR). However, little is known about which, and how,acoustic cues are utilized for SVR as opposed to OVR. To address this question,we independently manipulated the F0 and formant information of recorded voicesand investigated their contributions to SVR and OVR. Japanese participants werepresented with recorded vocal stimuli and were asked to identify thespeaker-either themselves or one of their peers. Six groups of 5 peers of thesame sex participated in the study. Under conditions where the formantinformation was fully preserved and where only the frequencies lower than thethird formant (F3) were retained, accuracies of SVR deteriorated significantlywith the modulation of the F0, and the results were comparable for OVR. Bycontrast, under a condition where only the frequencies higher than F3 wereretained, the accuracy of SVR was significantly higher than that of OVRthroughout the range of F0 modulations, and the F0 scarcely affected theaccuracies of SVR and OVR. Our results indicate that while both F0 and formantinformation are involved in SVR, as well as in OVR, the advantage of SVR ismanifested only when major formant information for speech intelligibility isabsent. These findings imply the robustness of self-voice representation,possibly by virtue of auditory familiarity and other factors such as itsassociation with motor/articulatory representation.
 The recent article (Turalska et al., 2012) discusses the emergence ofintelligence via criticality as a consequence of locality breakdown. Herein, weuse criticality for the foundation of a novel generation of game theory makingthe local interaction between players yield long-range effects. We firstestablish that criticality is not confined to the Ising-like structure of thesociological model of (Turalska et al., 2012), called the decision making model(DMM), through the study of the emergence of altruism using thealtruism-selfishness model (ASM). Both models generate criticality, one byimitation of opinion (DMM) and the other by imitation of behavior (ASM). Thedynamics of a sociological network influences the behavioral network F throughtwo game theoretic paradigms: (i) the value of altruism; (ii) the benefit ofrapid consensus. In (i), the network debates the moral issue of altruism by meansof the DMM, while at the level F the individuals operate according to the ASM.The individuals of the level , through a weak influence on the individuals of thelevel F, exert a societal control on F, fitting the principle of complexitymanagement and complexity matching. In (ii), the benefit to society is the rapid attainment of consensus in the level. The agents of the level F operate accordingto the prisoner's dilemma prescription, with the defectors acting as DMMcontrarians at the level . The contrarians, acting as the inhibitory links ofneural networks, exert on society the same beneficial effect of maintaining thecriticality-induced resilience that they generate in neural networks. Theconflict between personal and social benefit makes the networks evolve towardcriticality. Finally, we show that the theory of this article is compatible with recent discoveries in the burgeoning field of social neuroscience.
 Social contexts can have dramatic effects on decisions. When individualsrecognize each other as coming from the same social group, they can coordinatetheir actions towards a common goal. Conversely, information about groupdifferences can lead to conflicts both economic and physical. Understanding howsocial information shapes decision processes is now a core goal both ofbehavioural economics and neuroeconomics. Here, we describe the foundations forresearch that combines the theoretical framework from identity economics with theexperimental methods of neuroscience. Research at this intersection would fillimportant gaps in the literature not addressed by current approaches in either ofthese disciplines, nor within social neuroscience, psychology or other fields. Weset forth a simple taxonomy of social contexts based on the information contentthey provide. And, we highlight the key questions that would be addressed by anew 'identity neuroeconomics'. Such research could serve as an important andnovel link between the social and natural sciences.
 Studies on bilingual word reading and translation have examined the effects oflexical variables (e.g., concreteness, cognate status) by comparing groups ofnon-translators with varying levels of L2 proficiency. However, little attention has been paid to another relevant factor: translation expertise (TI). To explore this issue, we administered word reading and translation tasks to two groups ofnon-translators possessing different levels of informal TI (Experiment 1), and tothree groups of bilinguals possessing different levels of translation training(Experiment 2). Reaction-time recordings showed that in all groups reading wasfaster than translation and unaffected by concreteness and cognate effects.Conversely, in both experiments, all groups translated concrete and cognate wordsfaster than abstract and non-cognate words, respectively. Notably, an advantageof backward over forward translation was observed only for low-proficiencynon-translators (in Experiment 1). Also, in Experiment 2, the modificationsinduced by translation expertise were more marked in the early than in the latestages of training and practice. The results suggest that TI contributes tomodulating inter-equivalent connections in bilingual memory.
 According to embodied cognition theories, concepts are contextually situated and grounded in neural systems that produce experiential states. This view predictsthat processing mental state concepts recruits neural regions associated withdifferent aspects of experience depending on the context in which peopleunderstand a concept. This neuroimaging study tested this prediction using a set of sentences that described emotional (e.g., fear, joy) and nonemotional (e.g.,thinking, hunger) mental states with internal focus (i.e., focusing on bodilysensations and introspection) or external focus (i.e., focusing on expression andaction). Consistent with our predictions, data suggested that the inferiorfrontal gyrus, a region associated with action representation, was engaged moreby external than internal sentences. By contrast, the ventromedial prefrontalcortex, a region associated with the generation of internal states, was engagedmore by internal emotion sentences than external sentence categories. Similarpatterns emerged when we examined the relationship between neural activity andindependent ratings of sentence focus. Furthermore, ratings of emotion wereassociated with activation in the medial prefrontal cortex, whereas ratings ofactivity were associated with activation in the inferior frontal gyrus. Theseresults suggest that mental state concepts are represented in a dynamic way,using context-relevant interoceptive and sensorimotor resources.
 Mirror-touch synesthesia (MTS) is the conscious experience of tactile sensations induced by seeing someone else touched. This paper considers two different,although not mutually exclusive, theoretical explanations and, in the finalsection, considers the relation between MTS and other forms of synesthesia andalso other kinds of vicarious perception (e.g., contagious yawning). TheThreshold Theory explains MTS in terms of hyper-activity within a mirror systemfor touch and/or pain. This offers a good account for some of the evidence (e.g.,from fMRI) but fails to explain the whole pattern (e.g., structural braindifferences outside of this system; performance on some tests of socialcognition). The Self-Other Theory explains MTS in terms of disturbances in theability to distinguish the self from others. This can be construed in terms ofover-extension of the bodily self in to others, or as difficulties in the controlof body-based self-other representations. In this account, MTS is a symptom of a broader cognitive profile. We suggest this meets the criteria for synesthesia,despite the proximal causal mechanisms remaining largely unknown, and that thetendency to localize vicarious sensory experiences distinguishes it from otherkinds of seemingly related phenomena (e.g., non-localized affective responses to observing pain).
 Using the remarkable overlap between brain circuits affected in Parkinson'sdisease (PD) and those underlying motor sequence learning, we may improve theeffectiveness of motor rehabilitation interventions by identifying motor learningfacilitators in PD. For instance, additional sensory stimulation and task cueing enhanced motor learning in people with PD, whereas exercising using musicalrhythms or console computer games improved gait and balance, and reduced somemotor symptoms, in addition to increasing task enjoyment. Yet, despite theseadvances, important knowledge gaps remain. Most studies investigating motorlearning in PD used laboratory-specific tasks and equipment, with littleresemblance to real life situations. Thus, it is unknown whether similar results could be achieved in more ecological setups and whether individual's taskengagement could further improve motor learning capacity. Moreover, the role ofsocial interaction in motor skill learning process has not yet been investigated in PD and the role of mind-set and self-regulatory mechanisms have beensporadically examined. Here, we review evidence suggesting that thesepsychosocial factors may be important modulators of motor learning in PD. Wepropose their incorporation in future research, given that it could lead todevelopment of improved non-pharmacological interventions aimed to preserve orrestore motor function in PD.
 The role of emotional processes in driving moral choices remains debated. Inparticular, diminished emotional processing and reduced empathy have beenassociated with unusual high rates of utilitarian responses in moral judgmentswhile, to date, the effects of diminished emotional processing and empathy onmoral decision-making have been only partially considered. In this study, weinvestigated the influence of empathy and alexithymia on behaviour and emotional responses while participants performed a moral decision task. Self-report(valence and arousal ratings) and physiological (skin conductance and heart rate)measures were collected during the task. Results showed that empathy andalexithymia shaped emotional reactions to moral decisions, but did not bias moralchoices. The more empathic the participants, the more dilemmas were perceived as unpleasant and arousing, and the greater the increase in skin conductance.Conversely, alexithymia was characterized by a reduced physiological activationduring moral decisions, but normal self-report ratings. Heart rate was notmodulated by empathy or alexithymia. These results add new evidence to the field of moral decision showing that empathy and alexithymia modulate emotionalreactions to moral decision.
 This study used fMRI to investigate the functioning of the Theory of Mind (ToM)cortical network in autism during the viewing of animations that in someconditions entailed the attribution of a mental state to animated geometricfigures. At the cortical level, mentalizing (attribution of metal states) isunderpinned by the coordination and integration of the components of the ToMnetwork, which include the medial frontal gyrus, the anterior paracingulate, and the right temporoparietal junction. The pivotal new finding was a functionalunderconnectivity (a lower degree of synchronization) in autism, especially inthe connections between frontal and posterior areas during the attribution ofmental states. In addition, the frontal ToM regions activated less inparticipants with autism relative to control participants. In the autism group,an independent psychometric assessment of ToM ability and the activation in theright temporoparietal junction were reliably correlated. The results togetherprovide new evidence for the biological basis of atypical processing of ToM inautism, implicating the underconnectivity between frontal regions and moreposterior areas.
 CONTEXT: Mind wandering--defined as a cognitive focus on information that isunrelated to immediate sensory input or the task at hand--is a ubiquitouscharacteristic of the human condition. When it occurs, the integrity of a widerange of cognitive skills can be compromised. OBJECTIVES: The current paperdescribes the phenomenon of mind wandering, explores its potential role inmedical practice and considers how the education system may profitably controlthis ubiquitous cognitive state. METHODS: We argue that because many aspects of amedical professional's work (such as fatigue and depression) maximise the mind's tendency to wander, this experience is likely to be a common occurrence in manymedical situations. We then review the psychological literature on mind wanderingas it relates to medical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this review, we suggest that because mind wandering interferes with an individual's ability to integrate current events into a more general context, its occurrence may lead to downstreamproblems in the way that symptoms are interpreted and treated. Finally, becausethe experience of mind wandering is often both difficult to control and hard torecognise, it is difficult to prevent. We argue that techniques that helpindividuals to become more mindful have the potential to ameliorate the cost ofmind wandering to the medical profession. Given the ubiquitous nature of theexperience of mind wandering, the integration of mindfulness training intomedical education programmes could be of general benefit to society at large.
 The development of social emotions such as compassion is crucial for successfulsocial interactions as well as for the maintenance of mental and physical health,especially when confronted with distressing life events. Yet, the neuralmechanisms supporting the training of these emotions are poorly understood. Tostudy affective plasticity in healthy adults, we measured functional neural andsubjective responses to witnessing the distress of others in a newly developedtask (Socio-affective Video Task). Participants' initial empathic responses tothe task were accompanied by negative affect and activations in the anteriorinsula and anterior medial cingulate cortex--a core neural network underlyingempathy for pain. Whereas participants reacted with negative affect beforetraining, compassion training increased positive affective experiences, even inresponse to witnessing others in distress. On the neural level, we observed that,compared with a memory control group, compassion training elicited activity in a neural network including the medial orbitofrontal cortex, putamen, pallidum, and ventral tegmental area--brain regions previously associated with positive affect and affiliation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the deliberatecultivation of compassion offers a new coping strategy that fosters positiveaffect even when confronted with the distress of others.
 Cognitive neuroscientists often study social cognition by using simple butsocially relevant stimuli, such as schematic faces or images of other people.Whilst this research is valuable, important aspects of genuine social encounters are absent from these studies, a fact that has recently drawn criticism. In thepresent review we argue for an empirical approach to the determination of theequivalence of different social stimuli. This approach involves the systematiccomparison of different types of social stimuli ranging in their approximation toa real social interaction. In garnering support for this cognitive ethologicalapproach, we focus on recent research in social attention that has involvedstimuli ranging from simple schematic faces to real social interactions. Wehighlight both meaningful similarities and differences in various socialattentional phenomena across these different types of social stimuli thusvalidating the utility of the research initiative. Furthermore, we argue thatexploring these similarities and differences will provide new insights intosocial cognition and social neuroscience.
 The so-called mirror neuron system (MNS) responds when humans observe actionsperformed by a member of their own species. This activity is understood as aninternal motor representation of the observed movement pattern. By contrastingmeaningless human hand movements with meaningless artificial movements of objectsin space, we tested the claim that exclusively movements belonging to the humanmotor repertoire have direct access to the MNS. Eighteen participants observedvideo clips of moving hands and objects while the hemodynamic response wasrecorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Second-level analysis of thehemodynamic response revealed substantially overlapping activation patterns forboth types of movements including relevant structures of the MNS (bilateralpremotor and parietal areas, occipito-temporal junction, postcentral gyrus andthe right superior temporal sulcus). This suggests that perceptual processing of moving hands and objects recruits similar and overlapping cortical networks.Direct comparison of the two movement types revealed stronger activations forhand movements mainly in structures of the MNS suggesting an "expertise effect". Overall, our results provide evidence that observing movements not explicitlybelonging to the human motor repertoire can activate the human MNS, most likelybecause an association with a biological movement is evoked.
 Cognitive control (CC) over emotional distraction is of particular importance foradaptive human behaviour and is associated with activity in the left dorsolateralprefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Deficient CC, e.g., presenting as negativity bias, hasbeen suggested to underlie many of the core symptoms of major depression (MD) andis associated with impairments of dlPFC function. Correspondingly, enhancement ofdlPFC activity with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) canameliorate these impairments in patients with MD. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a reduction of dlPFC activity by cathodal tDCS induces CC deficits, thustriggering a depression-like negativity bias in healthy subjects. Twenty-eightindividuals participated in a double-blinded, balanced randomized crossover trialof cathodal (1 mA, 20 min) and sham tDCS applied to the left dlPFC. To assess CC we conducted a delayed response working memory (DWM) task and an arithmeticinhibition task (AIT) with pictures of varying valent content (negative, neutral,positive) during and immediately after stimulation. Cathodal tDCS led to impairedCC specifically over negative material as assessed by reduced response accuracyin the DWM and prolonged response latency in the AIT. Hence, the current studysupports the notion that left dlPFC is critically involved in CC over negativematerial. Together with previously reported beneficial anodal effects, itindicates that the hypoactivation of left dlPFC causes deficits in CC overnegative material, which is a possible aetiological mechanism of depression.
 The recent finding that Broca's area, the motor center for speech, is activatedduring action observation lends support to the idea that human language may have evolved from neural substrates already involved in gesture recognition. Although fascinating, this hypothesis can be questioned because while observing actions ofothers we may evoke some internal, verbal description of the observed scene. Herewe present fMRI evidence that the involvement of Broca's area during actionobservation is genuine. Observation of meaningful hand shadows resembling moving animals induces a bilateral activation of frontal language areas. This activationsurvives the subtraction of activation by semantically equivalent stimuli, aswell as by meaningless hand movements. Our results demonstrate that Broca's area plays a role in interpreting actions of others. It might act as a motor-assembly system, which links and interprets motor sequences for both speech and handgestures.
 Previous tests of P300 in deception detection have focused mainly on amplitudeanalysis. Since countermeasures for such tests have been reported, we looked hereat other possible variables as deception indices: P300 scalp distribution andamplitude variance, both across 30 sites. We were also concerned, for the firsttime, in testing for recognition of more than one guilty item in a mock crimescenario. There were three groups: (1) two-probe group, two of six items wereguilty knowledge (GK) items; (2) three-probe group, three of six items were GKitems; (3) control group, zero of six items were GK items. In group analyses, in the two-probe group, P300s for lies were significantly greater than P300s fortruthful responses. There were significant interactions of condition (Lie vsTruth) by site, suggesting different scalp profiles for deceptive versus truthfulresponding. Amplitude variance across sites was also greater in Lie than in Truthblocks. These results did not obtain in the three-probe and control groups. Interms of amplitude variances in probe conditions across groups, two-probe groupwas larger than three-probe and control groups. Regarding individual diagnostics,the variance method yielded a greater-than-chance detection rate of 71% versus28% false positives. Regarding amplitude at multiple nonfrontal sites, 71% ofguilty subjects were detected versus 14% false positives. Grier's (1971) A'indices of various test discrimination efficiencies varied from .76 to .87.Results of the present study suggested further investigation of the variancemethod as a diagnostic tool for lie detection.
 A growing body of evidence suggests that empathy for pain is underpinned byneural structures that are also involved in the direct experience of pain. Inorder to assess the consistency of this finding, an image-based meta-analysis of nine independent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigations and a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 32 studies that had investigated empathy for pain using fMRI were conducted. The results indicate that a core networkconsisting of bilateral anterior insular cortex and medial/anterior cingulatecortex is associated with empathy for pain. Activation in these areas overlapswith activation during directly experienced pain, and we link their involvementto representing global feeling states and the guidance of adaptive behavior forboth self- and other-related experiences. Moreover, the image-based analysisdemonstrates that depending on the type of experimental paradigm this corenetwork was co-activated with distinct brain regions: While viewing pictures ofbody parts in painful situations recruited areas underpinning actionunderstanding (inferior parietal/ventral premotor cortices) to a stronger extent,eliciting empathy by means of abstract visual information about the other'saffective state more strongly engaged areas associated with inferring andrepresenting mental states of self and other (precuneus, ventral medialprefrontal cortex, superior temporal cortex, and temporo-parietal junction). Inaddition, only the picture-based paradigms activated somatosensory areas,indicating that previous discrepancies concerning somatosensory activity duringempathy for pain might have resulted from differences in experimental paradigms. We conclude that social neuroscience paradigms provide reliable and accurateinsights into complex social phenomena such as empathy and that meta-analyses of previous studies are a valuable tool in this endeavor.
 Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most frequent drug-resistant epilepsy inadults and commonly associated with variable degrees of mesiotemporal atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Analyses of inter-regional connectivity haveunveiled disruptions in large-scale cortico-cortical networks; little is knownabout the topological organization of the mesiotemporal lobe, the limbicsubnetwork central to the disorder. We generated covariance networks based onhigh-resolution MRI surface-shape descriptors of the hippocampus, entorhinalcortex, and amygdala in 134 TLE patients and 45 age- and sex-matched controls.Graph-theoretical analysis revealed increased path length and clustering inpatients, suggesting a shift toward a more regularized arrangement; findings werereproducible after split-half assessment and across 2 parcellation schemes.Analysis of inter-regional correlations and module participation showed increasedwithin-structure covariance, but decreases between structures, particularly with regards to the hippocampus and amygdala. While higher clustering possiblyreflects topological consequences of axonal sprouting, decreases ininterstructure covariance may be a consequence of disconnection within limbiccircuitry. Preoperative network parameters, specifically the segregation of theipsilateral hippocampus, predicted long-term seizure freedom after surgery.
 Using structural MRI, we investigated the brain substrates of both affective and cognitive theory of mind (ToM) in 19 patients with semantic dementia. We also ranintrinsic connectivity analyses to identify the networks to which the substrates belong and whether they are functionally disturbed in semantic dementia. In line with previous studies, we observed a ToM impairment in patients with semanticdementia even when semantic memory was regressed out. Our results alsohighlighted different neural bases according to the nature (affective orcognitive) of the representations being inferred. The affective ToM deficit wasassociated with atrophy in the amygdala, suggesting the involvement ofemotion-processing deficits in this impairment. By contrast, cognitive ToMperformances were correlated with the volume of medial prefrontal and parietalregions, as well as the right frontal operculum. Intrinsic connectivity analyses revealed decreased functional connectivity, mainly between midline corticalregions and temporal regions. They also showed that left medial temporal regions were functionally isolated, a further possible hindrance to normal socialcognitive functioning in semantic dementia. Overall, this study addressed for thefirst time the neuroanatomical substrates of both cognitive and affective ToMdisruption in semantic dementia, highlighting disturbed connectivity within thenetworks that sustain these abilities.
 Functional neuroimaging investigations in the fields of social neuroscience andneuroeconomics indicate that the anterior insular cortex (AI) is consistentlyinvolved in empathy, compassion, and interpersonal phenomena such as fairness andcooperation. These findings suggest that AI plays an important role in socialemotions, hereby defined as affective states that arise when we interact withother people and that depend on the social context. After we link the role of AI in social emotions to interoceptive awareness and the representation of currentglobal emotional states, we will present a model suggesting that AI is not onlyinvolved in representing current states, but also in predicting emotional states relevant to the self and others. This model also proposes that AI enables us tolearn about emotional states as well as about the uncertainty attached to events,and implies that AI plays a dominant role in decision making in complex anduncertain environments. Our review further highlights that dorsal andventro-central, as well as anterior and posterior subdivisions of AI potentially subserve different functions and guide different aspects of behavioralregulation. We conclude with a section summarizing different routes tounderstanding other people's actions, feelings and thoughts, emphasizing thenotion that the predominant role of AI involves understanding others' feeling andbodily states rather than their action intentions or abstract beliefs.
 Social neuroscience is a new, interdisciplinary field devoted to understandinghow biological systems implement social processes and behavior. Socialneuroscience capitalizes on biological concepts and methods to inform and refine theories of social behavior, and it uses social and behavioral constructs anddata to inform and refine theories of neural organization and function. We focus here on the progress and potential of social neuroscience in the area of mentalhealth. Research in social neuroscience has grown dramatically in recent years.Among the most active areas of research we found are brain-imaging studies innormal children and adults; animal models of social behavior; studies of strokepatients; imaging studies of psychiatric patients; and research on socialdeterminants of peripheral neural, neuroendocrine, and immunological processes.We also found that these areas of research are proceeding along largelyindependent trajectories. Our goals in this article are to review the developmentof this field, examine some currently promising approaches, identify obstaclesand opportunities for future advances and integration, and consider how thisresearch can inform work on the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders.
 Intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) modulates social perception and cognition in humansand could be an effective pharmacotherapy for treating social impairmentsassociated with neuropsychiatric disorders, like autism. However, it is unknownhow IN-OT modulates social cognition, its effect after repeated use, or itsimpact on the developing brain. Animal models are urgently needed. This studyexamined the effect of IN-OT on social perception in monkeys using tasks thatreveal some of the social impairments seen in autism. Six rhesus macaques (Macacamulatta, 4 males) received a 48 IU dose of OT or saline placebo using a pediatricnebulizer. An hour later, they performed a computerized task (the dot-probe task)to measure their attentional bias to social, emotional, and nonsocial images.Results showed that IN-OT significantly reduced monkeys' attention to negativefacial expressions, but not neutral faces or clip art images and, additionally,showed a trend to enhance monkeys' attention to direct vs. averted gaze faces.This study is the first to demonstrate an effect of IN-OT on social perception inmonkeys, IN-OT selectively reduced monkey's attention to negative facialexpressions, but not neutral social or nonsocial images. These findingscomplement several reports in humans showing that IN-OT reduces the aversivequality of social images suggesting that, like humans, monkey social perceptionis mediated by the oxytocinergic system. Importantly, these results in monkeyssuggest that IN-OT does not dampen the emotional salience of social stimuli, but rather acts to affect the evaluation of emotional images during the early stages of information processing.
 Cognitive capacity is believed to decline with age, but it is not known whetherthis decline extends to tasks involving social cognition. In the current study,social neuroscience methodologies were used to examine the effects of age-relatedcognitive decline on older adults' abilities to engage regulatory mechanisms(which are typically impaired by normal aging) to inhibit negative reactions tostigmatized individuals. Older and young adults were presented with images ofstigmatized individuals (e.g., individuals with amputations, substance abusers)and of normal controls while they underwent functional magnetic resonanceimaging. All participants were also given a battery of tests to assess theirexecutive function capacity. Young adults showed more activity in areasassociated with empathy (i.e., medial prefrontal cortex) than did older adultswhen viewing stigmatized faces. By contrast, older adults with relativelypreserved levels of executive function had heightened activity in areaspreviously implicated in emotion regulation (i.e., lateral prefrontal cortex) as compared to other groups. These results suggest that although cognitive declinemay interfere with older adults' attitudes toward stigmatized individuals, older adults with relatively preserved cognitive function may utilize differentstrategies to compensate for these deficits.
 The ability to attribute mental states to others and understand the basis oftheir decisions is essential for human social interaction. A controversial theorystates that this is achieved by simulating another's information processing inone's own neural circuits. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is known to playan important role in the registration of discrepancies between the predicted and actual outcomes of decisions (prediction errors).When positive and negativefeedback fails altogether, the failure may also signal errors in the predictionthat the outcome of that decision would be informative and guide futuredecisions. Does the ACC signal that an outcome is unexpectedly uninformative?When an outcome directed to others is uninformative, do we understand theirmental states by simulating them in the circuits of the ACC in our own brain? Theaim of our study was to test for these two possibilities in the human brain with event-related fMRI. We tested whether the ACC processes errors in the prediction of informative feedback and whether the ACC is also activated when scannedsubjects process the same outcomes of another's decisions. We show that each isprocessed by a separate subregion of the ACC.
 Infants make predictions about actions they observe already during the first yearof life. To investigate the role of the motor system in predicting the end state of observed actions, 12-month-old infants were shown movies of ordinary andextraordinary object-directed actions. The stimuli displayed a female actor whopicked up an everyday object (a cup or a phone) and brought it to either hermouth or her ear. In this way, a similar movement could be ordinary (e.g., cup tomouth) or extraordinary (e.g., phone to mouth) depending on the object used.Infants' EEG and eye movements were recorded. We found a significantly strongermotor activation, indicated by a stronger desynchronization in the mu-frequencyband over fronto-central areas, during observation of extraordinary compared toordinary actions. This is explained within the computational framework of Kilner,Friston, and Frith (2007), who suggest that the motor system is used to generate predictions about actions we observe. If the observed action deviates from theinitially expected path, additional predictions have to be generated, resultingin a stronger motor activation during perception of extraordinary actions. Insum, it appears that from early in life, the motor system is involved in makingpredictions about how an observed action will end.
 Autism and Asperger Syndrome are autism spectrum conditions (ASC) characterizedby deficits in understanding others' minds, an aspect of which involvesrecognizing emotional expressions. This is thought to be related to atypicalfunction and structure of the amygdala, and performance by people with ASC onemotion recognition tasks resembles that seen in people with acquired amygdaladamage. In general, emotion recognition findings in ASC have been inconsistent,which may reflect low numbers of participants, low numbers of stimuli and trials,heterogeneity of symptom severity within ASC groups, and ceiling effects on some tasks. The present study tested 39 male adults with ASC and 39 typical malecontrols on a task of basic emotion recognition from photographs, in two separateexperiments. On a control face discrimination task the group with ASC were notimpaired. People with ASC were less accurate on the emotion recognition taskcompared to controls, but only for the negative basic emotions. This is discussedin the light of similar findings from people with damage to the amygdala.
 PURPOSE: A lack of fatigue-related muscle contractile property changes at time ofperceived physical exhaustion and greater central than peripheral fatiguedetected by twitch interpolation technique have recently been reported in cancer survivors with fatigue symptoms. Based on these observations, it was hypothesizedthat compared to healthy people, myoelectrical manifestation of fatigue in theperforming muscles would be less significant in these individuals whilesustaining a prolonged motor task to self-perceived exhaustion (SPE) since their central fatigue was more prominent. The purpose of this study was to test thishypothesis by examining electromyographic (EMG) signal changes during fatiguingmuscle performance. METHODS: Twelve individuals who had advanced solid cancer andcancer-related fatigue (CRF), and 12 age- and gender-matched healthy controlsperformed a sustained elbow flexion at 30% maximal voluntary contraction tillSPE. Amplitude and mean power frequency (MPF) of EMG signals of the bicepsbrachii, brachioradialis, and triceps brachii muscles were evaluated when theindividuals experienced minimal, moderate, and severe fatigue. RESULTS: CRFpatients perceived physical "exhaustion" significantly sooner than the controls. The myoelectrical manifestation of muscular fatigue assessed by EMG amplitude andMPF was less significant in CRF than controls. The lower MPF even at minimalfatigue stage in CRF may indicate pathophysiologic condition of the muscle.CONCLUSIONS: CRF patients experience less myoelectrical manifestation of musclefatigue than healthy individuals near the time of SPE. The data suggest thatcentral nervous system fatigue plays a more important role in limitingendurance-type of motor performance in patients with CRF.
 High resolution thermal infrared imaging is a pioneering method giving indices ofsympathetic activity via the contact-free recording of facial tissues (thermalimprints). Compared to established stress markers, the great advantage of thismethod is its non-invasiveness. The goal of our study was to pilot the use ofthermal infrared imaging in the classical setting of human stress research.Thermal imprints were compared to established stress markers (heart rate, heartrate variability, finger temperature, alpha-amylase and cortisol) in 15participants undergoing anticipation, stress and recovery phases of twolaboratory stress tests, the Cold Pressor Test and the Trier Social Stress Test. The majority of the thermal imprints proved to be change-sensitive in both tests.While correlations between the thermal imprints and established stress markerswere mostly non-significant, the thermal imprints (but not the established stressmakers) did correlate with stress-induced mood changes. Multivariate patternanalysis revealed that in contrast to the established stress markers the thermal imprints could not disambiguate anticipation, stress and recovery phases of both tests. Overall, these results suggest that thermal infrared imaging is a valuablemethod for the estimation of sympathetic activity in the stress laboratorysetting. The use of this non-invasive method may be particularly beneficial forcovert recordings, in the study of special populations showing difficulties incomplying with the standard instruments of data collection and in the domain ofpsychophysiological covariance research. Meanwhile, the established stressmarkers seem to be superior when it comes to the characterization of complexphysiological states during the different phases of the stress cycle.
 Depression has been linked to counterfactual thinking in many behavioral studies,but the direction of this effect remains disputed. In the current study, therelationship between depression and counterfactual thinking was examined usingthe event-related potential (ERP) technique. In a binary choice gambling task,outcome feedback of the chosen option and that of the alternative option wereboth provided, so as to elicit the process of counterfactual comparison. Byinvestigating ERP signals in response to outcome presentation, we discovered thatwhen the fictive outcome was better or worse than the factual outcome, theamplitude of the P3 component was positively correlated with individual levels ofdepression, but not levels of anxiety. These results indicate that depressionstrengthens both upward counterfactual thinking and downward counterfactualthinking. The implication of this finding to clinical research is discussed.
 Early-stage romantic love involves reorganization of neurohormonal systems andbehavioral patterns marked by mutual influences between the partners' physiology and behavior. Guided by the biobehavioral synchrony conceptual frame, we testedbidirectional influences between the partners' hormones and conflict behavior at the initiation of romantic love. Participants included 120 new lovers (60couples) and 40 singles. Plasma levels of five affiliation and stress-relatedhormones were assessed: oxytocin (OT), prolactin (PRL), testosterone (T),cortisol (CT), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). Couples were observed in conflict interaction coded for empathy and hostility. CT and DHEAS showeddirect actor effects: higher CT and DHEAS predicted greater hostility. OT showed direct partner effects: individuals whose partners had higher OT showed greaterempathy. T and CT showed combined actor-partner effects. High T predicted greaterhostility only when partner also had high T, but lower hostility when partner hadlow T. Similarly, CT predicted low empathy only in the context of high partner's CT. Mediational analysis indicated that combined high CT in both partners wasassociated with relationship breakup as mediated by decrease in empathy. Findingsdemonstrate the mutual influences between hormones and behavior within anattachment bond and underscore the dynamic, co-regulated, and systemic nature of pair-bond formation in humans.
 Pupil dilation under constant illumination is a physiological marker wheremodulation is related to several cognitive functions involved in daily decisionmaking. There is evidence for a role of pupil dilation change duringdecision-making tasks associated with uncertainty, reward-prediction errors andsurprise. However, while some work suggests that pupil dilation is mainlymodulated by reward predictions, others point out that this marker is related to uncertainty signaling and surprise. Supporting the latter hypothesis, the neural substrate of this marker is related to noradrenaline (NA) activity which has beenalso related to uncertainty signaling. In this work we aimed to test whetherpupil dilation is a marker for uncertainty and surprise in a learning task. Werecorded pupil dilation responses in 10 participants performing the Iowa GamblingTask (IGT), a decision-making task that requires learning and constant monitoringof outcomes' feedback, which are important variables within the traditional studyof human decision making. Results showed that pupil dilation changes weremodulated by learned uncertainty and surprise regardless of feedback magnitudes. Interestingly, greater pupil dilation changes were found during positive feedback(PF) presentation when there was lower uncertainty about a future negativefeedback (NF); and by surprise during NF presentation. These results support the hypothesis that pupil dilation is a marker of learned uncertainty, and may beused as a marker of NA activity facing unfamiliar situations in humans.
 Recent neuroimaging studies on "theory of mind" have demonstrated that the medialprefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved when subjects are engaged in various kinds ofmentalising tasks. Although a large number of neuroimaging studies have beenpublished, a relatively small amount of neuropsychological evidence supportsinvolvement of the medial PFC in theory of mind reasoning. We recruited twoneurological cases with damage to the medial PFC and initially performed thestandard neuropsychological assessments for intelligence, memory, and executivefunctions. To examine theory of mind performance in these two cases, four kindsof standard and advanced tests for theory of mind were used, including first- andsecond-order false belief tests, the strange stories test, and the faux pasrecognition test. Both patients were also requested to complete the questionnairefor the autism-spectrum quotient. Neither case showed impairment on standardtheory of mind tests and only mild impairments were seen on advanced theory ofmind tests. This pattern of results is basically consistent with previousstudies. The most interesting finding was that both cases showed personalitychanges after surgical operations, leading to characteristics of autism showing alack of social interaction in everyday life. We discuss herein the possible rolesof the medial PFC and emphasize the importance of using multiple approaches tounderstand the mechanisms of theory of mind and medial prefrontal functions.
 BACKGROUND: The roles of iron in epilepsy and its pathophysiological significanceare poorly understood, especially whether iron levels are abnormal in subcortcal structures. This study aims to demonstrate whole-brain iron alterations and itsclinical relevancies in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) in vivo, usingsusceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (SWI). METHODS: We studied 62 patients with mTLE and 62 healthy controls. Brain iron concentration wasquantified using SWI phase values. Voxel-wise analysis was carried out to compareiron levels between mTLE and controls, and to assess the relationship betweenaltered iron concentration and clinical parameters in mTLE. RESULTS: Patientswith mTLE showed decreases of iron levels in the subcortical structures such assubstantia nigra, red nucleus, and basal ganglia. Conversely, iron levels weredecreased in the cortex. Subcortical iron levels were negatively correlated tothose in the cortex. Moreover, cortical and basal ganglia iron levels wererelated to clinical variables including epilepsy duration, age at seizures onset,and histories of precipitating factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our SWI findings suggest aredistribution of iron between subcortical and cortical structures in mTLE. Thedegree of redistribution is affected by both progression of epilepsy andprecipitating factors. Investigation on brain iron redistribution offers newinsights into the pathogenesis of mTLE, and may be a potential biomarker formonitoring the clinical progression of epilepsy.
 BACKGROUND: Acute stroke care represents a challenge for decision makers.Decisions based on erroneous assessments may generate false expectations ofpatients and their family members, and potentially inappropriate medical advice. Game theory is the analysis of interactions between individuals to study howconflict and cooperation affect our decisions. AIMS: We reviewed principles ofgame theory that could be applied to medical decisions under uncertainty.SUMMARY: Medical decisions in acute stroke care are usually made underconstrains: short period of time, with imperfect clinical information, limitunderstanding about patients and families' values and beliefs. Game theory bringssome strategies to help us manage complex medical situations under uncertainty.For example, it offers a different perspective by encouraging the considerationof different alternatives through the understanding of patients' preferences and the careful evaluation of cognitive distortions when applying 'real-world' data. The stag-hunt game teaches us the importance of trust to strength cooperation fora successful patient-physician interaction that is beyond a good or poor clinicaloutcome. CONCLUSIONS: The application of game theory to stroke care may improveour understanding of complex medical situations and help clinicians makepractical decisions under uncertainty.
 Since the first demonstrations that mindfulness-based therapies could have apositive influence on chronic pain patients, numerous studies have been conductedwith healthy individuals in an attempt to understand meditative analgesia. Thisreview focuses explicitly on experimental pain studies of meditation and attemptsto draw preliminary conclusions based on the work completed in this new fieldover the past 6 years. Dividing meditative practices into the broad categories offocused attention (FA) and open monitoring (OM) techniques allowed severalpatterns to emerge. The majority of evidence for FA practices suggests they arenot particularly effective in reducing pain. OM, on the other hand, seems toinfluence both sensory and affective pain ratings depending on the tradition oron whether the practitioners were meditating. The neural pattern underlying pain modulation during OM suggests meditators actively focus on the noxiousstimulation while inhibiting other mental processes, consistent with descriptionsof mindfulness. A preliminary model is presented for explaining the influence of mindfulness practice on pain. Finally, the potential analgesic effect of thecurrently unexplored technique of compassion meditation is discussed.
 The true intentions of humans are sometimes difficult to ascertain exclusivelyfrom explicit expressions, such as speech, gestures, or facial expressions. Inthis experiment, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used toinvestigate implicit intentions that were generated while a subject was readingself-relevant sentences. Short sentences, which were presented visually,consisted of self-relevant statements and a substantive verb, which indicatedsentence polarity as either affirmative or negative. Each sentence was dividedinto the contents and the sentence ending, and the subjects were asked to respondwith either agreement or disagreement after the complete sentence was presented. The overall group analysis suggested that the intention of the sentence response was found even before the reading of the complete sentences. Increased neuralactivation was found in the left medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) during feelings of agreement compared to feelings of disagreement during self-relevantdecision-making. In addition, according to the sentence ending, the decision of aresponse activated the frontopolar cortex (FPC) in the switching condition. Thesefindings indicated that the implicit intentions of responses to the givenstatements were internally generated before an explicit response occurred, and,hence, intentions can be used to predict a subject's future answer.
 Alcohol-dependence is associated with cognitive and biological alterations, andalso with interpersonal impairments. Although overwhelming in clinical settingsand involved in relapse, these social impairments have received little attention from researchers. Particularly, brain alterations related to social exclusionhave not been explored in alcohol-dependence. Our primary purpose was todetermine the neural correlates of social exclusion feelings in this population. In all, 44 participants (22 abstinent alcohol-dependent patients and 22 pairedcontrols) played a virtual game ('cyberball') during fMRI recording. They werefirst included by other players, then excluded, and finally re-included. Brainareas involved in social exclusion were identified and the functionalconnectivity between these areas was explored using psycho-physiologicalinteractions (PPI). Results showed that while both groups presented dorsalanterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activations during social exclusion,alcohol-dependent participants exhibited increased insula and reduced frontalactivations (in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) as compared with controls.Alcohol-dependence was also associated with persistent dACC and parahippocampalgyrus activations in re-inclusion. PPI analyses showed reduced frontocingulateconnectivity during social exclusion in alcohol-dependence. Alcohol-dependence isthus linked with increased activation in areas eliciting social exclusionfeelings (dACC-insula), and with impaired ability to inhibit these feelings(indexed by reduced frontal activations). Altered frontal regulation thus appearsimplied in the interpersonal alterations observed in alcohol-dependence, whichseem reinforced by impaired frontocingulate connectivity. This first exploration of the neural correlates of interpersonal problems in alcohol-dependence couldinitiate the development of a social neuroscience of addictive states.
 In recent years good progress has been made in uncovering the geneticunderpinnings of schizophrenia. Even so, as a polygenic disorder, schizophreniahas a complex etiology that is far from understood. Meanwhile data are beingcollected enabling the study of interactions between genes and the environment. Aconfluence of data from genetic and environmental exposure studies points to the role of infections and immunity in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In arecent study by Borglum et al., a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in thegene CTNNA3 was identified that may provide clues to gene-environmentinteractions. The carriers of the minor allele for the SNP had a 5 fold risk oflater developing schizophrenia if their mothers were CMV positive, while thechildren not carrying the allele had no excess risk from maternal CMV. In thecurrent paper we summarize recent advances to clarify possible mechanism of such interactions between the host genotype and infection in schizophrenia risk.
 An absence of coupling between cognition and perception can mean that the mindneglects the careful processing of information relevant to the task at hand anderrors can ensue. Given that highly salient perceptual events can automaticallycapture attention, the current study explored whether the same neglect oftask-relevant information was possible for stimuli with high levels of perceptualsaliency (e.g., identifiable by colour). In four experiments, participantsperformed a go/no-go task with a low frequency of no-go events. Across allexperiments, response inhibition was more successful for coloured no-go targetsthan for stimuli that shared the same colour as the go targets. In addition, the response time (reaction time [RT]) for rare, coloured go targets was slower than when the same events were noncolored. Together, these results suggest that inrelatively simple go/no-go tasks, highly salient perceptual events captureattention in an automatic fashion. Increased visual salience is argued to bebeneficial when associated with no-go targets because it momentarily enforcescoupling between attention and perception, disrupting ongoing behaviour at theprecise moment when not responding is the correct action to take. These resultssuggest that although the mind may at times neglect events in the environment,salient perceptual events cannot be ignored in the same way.
 The aim of the present study was to investigate the neural bases of cooperativebehaviors and social self-perception underlying the execution of joint actions byusing a hyperscanning brain paradigm with functional near-infrared spectroscopy(fNIRS). We firstly found that an artificial positive feedback on the cognitiveperformance was able to affect the self-perception of social position andhierarchy (higher social ranking) for the dyad, as well as the cognitiveperformance (decreased error rate, ER, and response times, RTs). In addition, theshared cognitive strategy was concurrently improved within the dyad after thissocial reinforcing. Secondly, fNIRS measures revealed an increased brain activityin the postfeedback condition for the dyad. Moreover, an interbrain similaritywas found for the dyads during the task, with higher coherent prefrontal cortex(PFC) activity for the interagents in the postfeedback condition. Finally, asignificant prefrontal brain lateralization effect was revealed, with the lefthemisphere being more engaged during the postfeedback condition. To summarize,the self-perception, the cognitive performance, and the shared brain activitywere all reinforced by the social feedback within the dyad.
 In this Commentary article we critically assess the claims made by Schurz,Kronbichler, Weissengrubler, Surtees, Samson and Perner (2015) relating to theneural processes underlying theory of mind and visual perspective taking. Theyattempt to integrate research findings in these two areas of social neuroscience using a perspective taking task contrasting mentalistic agents ('avatars'), with non-mentalistic control stimuli ('arrows'), during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We support this endeavour whole-heartedly, agreeing that the integrationof findings in these areas has been neglected in research on the social brain.However, we cannot find among the behavioural or neuroimaging data presented bySchurz et al. evidence supporting their claim of 'implicit mentalizing'-theautomatic ascription of mental states to another representing what they can see. Indeed, we suggest that neuroimaging methods may be ill-suited to address theexistence of implicit mentalizing, and suggest that approaches utilizingneurostimulation methods are likely to be more successful.
 The extent to which loneliness is a unique risk factor for depressive symptomswas determined in 2 population-based studies of middle-aged to older adults, and the possible causal influences between loneliness and depressive symptoms wereexamined longitudinally in the 2nd study. In Study 1, a nationally representativesample of persons aged 54 and older completed a telephone interview as part of a study of health and aging. Higher levels of loneliness were associated with more depressive symptoms, net of the effects of age, gender, ethnicity, education,income, marital status, social support, and perceived stress. In Study 2,detailed measures of loneliness, social support, perceived stress, hostility, anddemographic characteristics were collected over a 3-year period from apopulation-based sample of adults ages 50-67 years from Cook County, Illinois.Loneliness was again associated with more depressive symptoms, net of demographiccovariates, marital status, social support, hostility, and perceived stress.Latent variable growth models revealed reciprocal influences over time betweenloneliness and depressive symptomatology. These data suggest that loneliness and depressive symptomatology can act in a synergistic effect to diminish well-being in middle-aged and older adults.
 Attachment is critical to each individual. It affects the cognitive-affectiveprocessing of social information. The present study examines how attachmentaffects the processing of social information, specifically maternal information. We assessed the behavioral and electrophysiological responses to maternalinformation (compared to non-specific others) in a Go/No-go Association Task(GNAT) with 22 participants. The results illustrated that attachment affectedmaternal information processing during three sequential stages of informationprocessing. First, attachment affected visual perception, reflected by enhancedP100 and N170 elicited by maternal information as compared to others information.Second, compared to others, mother obtained more attentional resources, reflectedby faster behavioral response to maternal information and larger P200 and P300.Finally, mother was evaluated positively, reflected by shorter P300 latency in a mother + good condition as compared to a mother + bad condition. These findingsindicated that the processing of attachment-relevant information isneurologically differentiated from other types of social information from anearly stage of perceptual processing to late high-level processing.
 People are more sensitive to losses than to equivalent gains when makingfinancial decisions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) toilluminate how the amygdala contributes to loss aversion. The blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response of the amygdala was mapped while healthy individualswere responding to 50/50 gambles with varying potential gain and loss amounts.Overall, subjects demanded twice as high potential gain as loss to accept agamble. The individual level of loss aversion was expressed by the decisionboundary, i.e., the gain-loss ratio at which subjects accepted and rejectedgambles with equal probability. Amygdala activity increased the more thegain-loss ratio deviated from the individual decision boundary showing that theamygdala codes action value. This response pattern was more strongly expressed inloss aversive individuals, linking amygdala activity with individual differences in loss aversion. Together, the results show that the amygdala signals subjectiveappetitiveness or aversiveness of gain-loss ratios at the time of choice.
 Extinction involves altering a previously established predictive relationshipbetween a cue and its outcome by repeatedly presenting that cue alone. Althoughit is widely accepted that extinction generates some form of inhibitory learning [1-4], direct evidence for this claim has been lacking, and the nature of theassociative changes induced by extinction have, therefore, remained a matter ofdebate [5-8]. In the current experiments, we used a novel behavioral approachthat we recently developed and that provides a direct measure of conditionedinhibition [9] to compare the influence of extinguished and non-extinguished cueson choice between goal-directed actions. Using this approach, we provide directevidence that extinction generates outcome-specific conditioned inhibition.Furthermore, we demonstrate that this inhibitory learning is controlled by theinfralimbic cortex (IL); inactivation of the IL using M4 DREADDs abolishedoutcome-specific inhibition and rendered the cue excitatory. Importantly, wefound that context modulated this inhibition. Outside its extinction context, thecue was excitatory and functioned as a specific predictor of its previouslyassociated outcome, biasing choice toward actions earning the same outcome. Inits extinction context, however, the cue acted as a specific inhibitor and biasedchoice toward actions earning different outcomes. Context modulation of theseexcitatory and inhibitory memories was mediated by the dorsal hippocampus (HPC), suggesting that the HPC and IL act in concert to control the influence ofconditioned inhibitors on choice. These findings demonstrate for the first timethat extinction turns a cue into a net inhibitor that can influence choice viacounterfactual action-outcome associations.
 Observation of changes in autonomic arousal was one of the first methodologiesused to detect deception. Electrodermal activity (EDA) is a peripheral measure ofautonomic arousal and one of the primary channels used in polygraph exams. In an attempt to develop a more central measure to identify lies, the use of functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to detect deception is being investigated. Wewondered if adding EDA to our fMRI analysis would improve our diagnostic ability.For our approach, however, adding EDA did not improve the accuracy in alaboratory-based deception task. In testing for brain regions that replicated as correlates of EDA, we did find significant associations in right orbitofrontaland bilateral anterior cingulate regions. Further work is required to testwhether EDA improves accuracy in other testing formats or with higher levels ofjeopardy.
 To study voluntary action a dissociation must be established between the somatic event (e.g, motor action) and what the agent voluntarily does (e.g, handing atool to a friend). We propose that cognitive neuroscience studies of hypnoticsuggestion can accomplish this dissociation between action and will (morespecifically, between action and intention, or action and volition). Thus,hypnotic suggestion may afford an empirical testing ground to study voluntaryaction, distinguishing voluntariness from action.
 Previous behavioral studies demonstrated that depressed individuals havedifficulties in forgetting unwanted, especially negative, event. However,inconsistent results still exit and the neural mechanism of this phenomenon hasnot been investigated. This study examined the intentional memoryfacilitation/suppression of negative and neutral materials in depression usingThink/No-Think paradigm. We found that compared with nondepressed group,depressed group recalled more negative items, irrespective of either "Think" or"No-Think" instructions. Accordingly, the frontal N2 (reflecting voluntary memoryinhibition) and parietal late positive component (LPC) (reflecting consciousrecollection) showed deflection for negative items in depressed compared withnondepressed participants. On the one hand, the reduced N2 for negative"No-Think" items indicated that depressed individuals have low motivation tosuppress negative items so intentional forgetting is less successful formood-congruent events. On the other hand, the enhanced LPC for negative "Think"items suggested that negative memories are excessively revisited by depressedparticipants (compared with nondepressed ones) due to their mood-congruent andintrusive nature. Thus we demonstrated that depressed individuals show behavioraland ERP deviations from healthy controls for both voluntary suppression andconscious retrieval of negative memory; the two abnormalities of memory controltogether contribute to the difficulties in forgetting negative material indepression.
 Emotion research is guided both by the view that emotions are points in adimensional space, such as valence or approach-withdrawal, and by the view thatemotions are discrete categories. We determined whether effective connectivity ofamygdala with medial orbitofrontal cortex (MOFC) and lateral orbitofrontal cortex(LOFC) differentiates the perception of emotion faces in a manner consistent withthe dimensional and/or categorical view. Greater effective connectivity from leftMOFC to amygdala differentiated positive and neutral expressions from negatively valenced angry, disgust, and fear expressions. Greater effective connectivityfrom right LOFC to amygdala differentiated emotion expressions conducive toperceiver approach (happy, neutral, and fear) from angry expressions that elicit perceiver withdrawal. Finally, consistent with the categorical view, there wereunique patterns of connectivity in response to fear, anger, and disgust, althoughnot in response to happy expressions, which did not differ from neutral ones.
 Recent studies suggest that psychopathy may be associated with dysfunction in theneural circuitry supporting both threat- and reward-related processes. However,these studies have involved small samples and often focused on extreme groups.Thus, it is unclear to what extent current findings may generalize topsychopathic traits in the general population. Furthermore, no studies havesystematically and simultaneously assessed associations between distinctpsychopathy facets and both threat- and reward-related brain function in the samesample of participants. Here, we examined the relationship between threat-relatedamygdala reactivity and reward-related ventral striatum (VS) reactivity andvariation in four facets of self-reported psychopathy in a sample of 200 youngadults. Path models indicated that amygdala reactivity to fearful facialexpressions is negatively associated with the interpersonal facet of psychopathy,whereas amygdala reactivity to angry facial expressions is positively associated with the lifestyle facet. Furthermore, these models revealed that differential VSreactivity to positive versus negative feedback is negatively associated with thelifestyle facet. There was suggestive evidence for gender-specific patterns ofassociation between brain function and psychopathy facets. Our findings are thefirst to document differential associations between both threat- andreward-related neural processes and distinct facets of psychopathy and thusprovide a more comprehensive picture of the pattern of neural vulnerabilitiesthat may predispose to maladaptive outcomes associated with psychopathy.
 Autism is an early onset neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by disruption of early social interaction. Although the social disability of autism remains thecentral defining feature of the condition, mechanisms that might account for thisdisability remain poorly understood. This paper briefly reviews some aspects ofthe social deficit in autism focusing on new approaches to characterizing social information processing problems, potential brain mechanisms, and theoreticalmodels of the disorder. It will touch on aspects of specific social processesthat appear to develop in unusual ways in autism including facial perception,joint attention, and social information processing. The importance of adoptingmore ecologically valid methods and for integrating the various approaches inderiving new models for social deficits in autism will be highlighted. Futureresearch should build on the emerging synergy of different aspects of socialneuroscience.
 Social animals adjust their behavior according to social relationships andmomentary circumstances. Dominant-submissive relationships modulate, but do notcompletely determine, their competitive behaviors. For example, a submissivemonkey's decision to retrieve food depends not only on the presence of dominantpartners but also on their observed behavior. Thus, behavioral expressionrequires a dynamic evaluation of reward outcome and momentary social states. The neural mechanisms underlying this evaluation remain elusive. The caudate nucleus (CN) plays a pivotal role in representing reward expectation and translating itinto action selection. To investigate whether their activities encode socialstate information, we recorded from CN neurons in monkeys while they performed a competitive food-grab task against a dominant competitor. We found two groups of CN neurons: one primarily responded to reward outcome, while the other primarily tracked the monkey's social state. These social state-dependent neurons showedgreater activity when the monkeys freely retrieved food without active challengesfrom the competitor and reduced activity when the monkeys were in a submissivestate due to the competitor's active behavior. These results indicate thatdifferent neuronal activities in the CN encode social state information andreward-related information, which may contribute to adjusting competitivebehavior in dynamic social contexts.
 Endogenous opioids have complex social effects that may depend on specificreceptor actions and vary depending on the "stage" of social behavior (e.g.,seeking vs. responding to social stimuli). We tested the effects of a nonspecificopioid antagonist, naltrexone (NTX), on social processing in humans. NTX is used to treat alcohol and opiate dependence, and may affect both mu and kappa-opioidsystems. We assessed attention ("seeking"), and subjective andpsychophysiological responses ("responding") to positive and negative socialstimuli. Based on literature suggesting mu-opioid blockade impairs positivesocial responses, we hypothesized that NTX would decrease responses to positivesocial stimuli. We also tested responses to negative stimuli, which might beeither increased by NTX's mu-opioid effects or decreased by its kappa-opioideffects. Thirty-four healthy volunteers received placebo, 25 mg, or 50 mg NTXacross three sessions under double-blind conditions. At each session,participants completed measures of attention, identification, and emotionalresponses for emotional faces and scenes. NTX increased attention to emotionalexpressions, slowed identification of sadness and fear, and decreased ratings of arousal for social and nonsocial emotional scenes. These findings are moreconsistent with anxiolytic kappa-antagonist than mu-blocking effects, suggesting effects on kappa receptors may contribute to the clinical effects of NTX.
 Past research indicates that social exclusion leads to self-control failure. The present research examined the neural substrates of this effect. Participants wererandomly assigned to either a social exclusion (n=15) or control (n=15)condition. Self-control was assessed by having participants solve 180 moderately difficult math problems while measuring how quickly they identified a suppliedanswer as correct or incorrect. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to assessneural activity during this task. Socially excluded participants showed lesseractivity in occipital and parietal cortex from 100-350 ms after the presentation of the math problems. When presented with the answers, socially excludedparticipants showed lesser activity in several regions, including occipital,parietal, and right prefrontal cortex from 100-300 ms post-stimulus. Furthermore,activation in the parietal and right prefrontal cortex mediated exclusion-controlperformance differences on math problems. The findings suggest that socialexclusion interferes with the executive control of attention, and this effect is manifest in specific aspects of cognitive performance and brain function.
 Numerous studies have documented that expectancy-violating (EV) behavior (i.e.,behavior that violates existing person impressions) elicits more effortfulcognitive processing compared to expectancy-consistent (EC) behavior. Somestudies also have shown that this effect is modulated by the valence of behavior,though this finding is inconsistent with some extant models of expectancyprocesses. The current research investigated whether the valence of EVinformation affects very rapid attentional processes thought to tag goal-relevantinformation for more elaborative processing at later stages. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants read depictions of behaviorthat either were consistent with or violated established impressions aboutfictitious characters. Consistent with predictions, a very earlyattention-related ERP component, the frontal P2, differentiated negative frompositive EV behavior but was unaffected by the valence of EC behavior. Thiseffect occurred much earlier in processing than has been demonstrated in priorreports of EV effects on neural response, suggesting that impression formationgoals tune attention to information that might signal the need to modify existingimpressions.
 Past research has revealed that individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) have deficits in interhemispheric transfer, complex novel problem-solving, and the comprehension of paralinguistic aspects of language. Case studies andfamily reports also suggest problems in social cognition. The performance of 11individuals with complete ACC and with normal intelligence was compared to thatof 13 IQ- and age-matched controls on three measures of social cognition.Individuals with ACC were indistinguishable from controls on the Happe Theory of Mind Stories and the Adult Faux Pas Test, but performed significantly worse onvarious portions of the Thames Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT)involving interpretations of videotaped social vignettes. Further analysis of theTASIT indicated that individuals with ACC showed deficiency in the recognition ofemotion, weakness in understanding paradoxical sarcasm, and particular difficultyinterpreting textual versus visual social cues. These results suggest that thetendency for deficient social cognition in individuals with ACC stems from acombination of difficulty integrating information from multiple sources, usingparalinguistic cues for emotion, and understanding nonliteral speech. Together,these deficits would contribute to a less robust theory of mind.
 The ability to predict the actions of others is quintessential for effectivesocial interactions, particularly in competitive contexts (e.g. in sport) whenknowledge about upcoming movements allows anticipating rather than reacting toopponents. Studies suggest that we predict what others are doing by using our ownmotor system as an internal forward model and that the fronto-parietal actionobservation network (AON) is fundamental for this ability. However, multiple-dutycells dealing with action perception and execution have been found in a varietyof cortical regions. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging toexplore, in expert basketball athletes and novices, whether the ability to makeearly predictions about the fate of sport-specific actions (i.e. free throws) is underpinned by neural regions beyond the classical AON. We found that, althoughinvolved in action prediction, the fronto-parietal AON was similarly activated innovices and experts. Importantly, athletes exhibited relatively greater activity in the extrastriate body area during the prediction task, probably due to theirexpert reading of the observed action kinematics. Moreover, experts exhibitedhigher activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and in the rightanterior insular cortex when producing errors, suggesting that they might become aware of their own errors. Correct action prediction induced higher posteriorinsular cortex activity in experts and higher orbito-frontal activity in novices,suggesting that body awareness is important for performance monitoring inexperts, whereas novices rely more on higher-order decision-making strategies.This functional reorganization highlights the tight relationship between actionanticipation, error awareness and motor expertise leading to body-relatedprocessing and differences in decision-making processes.
 To investigate whether the legal concept of "corporate personhood" mirrors aninherent similarity in the neural processing of the actions of corporations andpeople, we measured brain responses to vignettes about corporations and peoplewhile participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found thatanti-social actions of corporations elicited more intense negative emotions andthat pro-social actions of people elicited more intense positive emotions.However, the networks underlying the moral decisions about corporations andpeople are strikingly similar, including regions of the canonical theory of mind network. In analyzing the activity in these networks, we found differences in theemotional processing of these two types of vignettes: neutral actions ofcorporations showed neural correlates that more closely resembled negativeactions than positive actions. Collectively, these findings indicate that ourbrains understand and analyze the actions of corporations and people verysimilarly, with a small emotional bias against corporations.
 This field study investigated the release of testosterone and cortisol of avicarious winning experience in Spanish fans watching the finals between Spainand the Netherlands in the 2010 FIFA World Cup Soccer. Spanish fans (n = 50)watched the match with friends or family in a public place or at home and alsoparticipated in a control condition. Consistent with hypotheses, results revealedthat testosterone and cortisol levels were higher when watching the match than ona control day. However, neither testosterone nor cortisol levels increased after the victory of the Spanish team. Moreover, the increase in testosterone secretionwas not related to participants' sex, age or soccer fandom, but the increase intotal cortisol secretion during the match was higher among men than among womenand among fans that were younger. Also, increases in cortisol secretion weregreater to the degree that people were a stronger fan of soccer. Level of fandom further appeared to account for the sex effect, but not for the age effect.Generally, the testosterone data from this study are in line with the challengehypothesis, as testosterone levels of watchers increased to prepare theirorganism to defend or enhance their social status. The cortisol data from thisstudy are in line with social self-preservation theory, as higher cortisolsecretion among young and greater soccer fans suggests that especially theyperceived that a negative outcome of the match would threaten their own socialesteem.
 Recent neuroimaging work has observed activity in cortical midline structures(CMS) such as medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices duringself-referential processing. Moreover, items rated as self-relevant produceincreased activity in these regions relative to items that are deemed notself-relevant. A common thread among previous reports has been reliance onexperimental tasks that encourage or require online self-referential processing. In this paper, we report findings from two experiments that manipulatedrequirements for self-reflection. In Experiment 1, subjects rated traitadjectives for social desirability and for self-relevance. Results revealedincreasing activity in CMS with increasing self-relevance, but only duringexplicit ratings of self-relevance. In Experiment 2, we examined CMS activityduring passive viewing of personal semantic facts (such as subjects' own firstnames). Taken together, these results suggest that highly self-relevantinformation captures attention through neural mechanisms that are comparable tothose engaged during explicit self-reflection, namely via recruitment of CMSstructures.
 Laboratory studies of social behavior have typically focused on dyadicinteractions occurring within a limited spatiotemporal context. However, thisstrategy prevents analyses of the dynamics of group social behavior andconstrains identification of the biological pathways mediating individualdifferences in behavior. In the current study, we aimed to identify thespatiotemporal dynamics and hierarchical organization of a large social networkof male mice. We also sought to determine if standard assays of social andexploratory behavior are predictive of social behavior in this social network andwhether individual network position was associated with the mRNA expression oftwo plasticity-related genes, DNA methyltransferase 1 and 3a. Mice were observed to form a hierarchically organized social network and self-organized into twoseparate social network communities. Members of both communities exhibiteddistinct patterns of socio-spatial organization within the vivaria that was notlimited to only agonistic interactions. We further established that exploratoryand social behaviors in standard behavioral assays conducted prior to placing themice into the large group was predictive of initial network position and behaviorbut were not associated with final social network position. Finally, wedetermined that social network position is associated with variation in mRNAlevels of two neural plasticity genes, DNMT1 and DNMT3a, in the hippocampus butnot the mPOA. This work demonstrates the importance of understanding the role of social context and complex social dynamics in determining the relationshipbetween individual differences in social behavior and brain gene expression.
 Animal models and human studies using paradigms designed to stimulate endogenous oxytocin release suggest a stress-buffering role of oxytocin. We here examinedthe involvement of stress-induced peripheral oxytocin secretion in reactivity andrecovery phases of the human psychosocial stress response. Healthy male andfemale participants (N=114) were subjected to a standardized laboratory stressor,the Trier Social Stress Test. In addition to plasma oxytocin, cortisol wasassessed as a marker of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA-) axis activity,alpha-amylase and heart rate as markers of sympathetic activity, high frequencyheart rate variability as a marker of vagal tone and self-rated anxiety as anindicator of subjective stress experience. On average, oxytocin levels increased by 51% following psychosocial stress. The stress-induced oxytocin secretion,however, did not reduce stress reactivity. To the contrary, higher oxytocinsecretion was associated with greater cortisol reactivity and peak cortisollevels in both sexes. In the second phase of the stress response the oppositepattern was observed, with higher oxytocin secretion associated with faster vagalrecovery. We suggest that after an early stage of oxytocin and HPA-axisco-activation, the stress-reducing action of oxytocin unfolds. Due to the timelag it manifests as a recovery-boosting rather than a reactivity-bufferingeffect. By reinforcing parasympathetic autonomic activity, specifically duringstress recovery, oxytocin may provide an important protective function againstthe health-compromising effects of sustained stress.
 Central arginine vasopressin receptor 1A (AVPR1A) modulates a wide range ofbehaviors, including stress management and territorial aggression, as well associal bonding and recognition. Inter- and intra-species variations in theexpression pattern of AVPR1A in the brain and downstream differential behavioral phenotypes have been attributed to differences in the non-coding regions of theAVPR1A gene, including polymorphic elements within upstream regulatory areas.Gene association studies have suggested a link between AVPR1A polymorphisms andautism, and AVPR1A has emerged as a potential pharmacological target fortreatment of social cognitive impairments and mood and anxiety disorders. Tofurther investigate the genetic mechanism giving rise to species differences inAVPR1A expression patterns and associated social behaviors, and to create apreclinical mouse model useful for screening drugs targeting AVPR1A, weengineered and extensively characterized bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)transgenic mice harboring the entire human AVPR1A locus with the surroundingregulatory elements. Compared with wild-type animals, the humanized micedisplayed a more widely distributed ligand-AVPR1A binding pattern, whichoverlapped with that of primates. Furthermore, humanized AVPR1A mice displayedincreased reciprocal social interactions compared with wild-type animals, but no differences in social approach and preference for social novelty were observed.Aspects of learning and memory, specifically novel object recognition and spatialrelocation recognition, were unaffected. The biological alterations in humanized AVPR1A mice resulted in the rescue of the prepulse inhibition impairments thatwere observed in knockout mice, indicating conserved functionality. Althoughfurther behavioral paradigms and additional cohorts need to be examined inhumanized AVPR1A mice, the results demonstrate that species-specific variationsin the genomic content of regulatory regions surrounding the AVPR1A locus areresponsible for differential receptor protein expression patterns across species and that they are likely to contribute to species-specific behavioral variation. The humanized AVPR1A mouse is a potential preclinical model for furtherunderstanding the regulation of receptor gene expression and the impact ofvariation in receptor expression on behaviors, and should be useful for screeningdrugs targeting human AVPR1A, taking advantage of the expression of human AVPR1A in human-relevant brain regions.
 We present evidence from a 5-year longitudinal study for the prospectiveassociations between loneliness and depressive symptoms in a population-based,ethnically diverse sample of 229 men and women who were 50-68 years old at study onset. Cross-lagged panel models were used in which the criterion variables were loneliness and depressive symptoms, considered simultaneously. We used variationson this model to evaluate the possible effects of gender, ethnicity, education,physical functioning, medications, social network size, neuroticism, stressfullife events, perceived stress, and social support on the observed associationsbetween loneliness and depressive symptoms. Cross-lagged analyses indicated that loneliness predicted subsequent changes in depressive symptomatology, but notvice versa, and that this temporal association was not attributable todemographic variables, objective social isolation, dispositional negativity,stress, or social support. The importance of distinguishing between lonelinessand depressive symptoms and the implications for loneliness and depressivesymptomatology in older adults are discussed.
 Argumentation is a crucial component of our lives. Although in the absence ofrational debate our legal, political, and scientific systems would not bepossible, there is still no integrated area of research on the psychology ofargumentation. Furthermore, classical theories of argumentation are normative(i.e., the acceptability of an argument is determined by a set of norms orlogical rules), which sometimes creates a dissociation between the theories andpeople's behavior. We think the current challenge for psychology is to bringtogether the cognitive and normative accounts of argumentation. In this article, we exemplify this point by analyzing two cases of argumentative structuresexperimentally studied in the context of cognitive psychology. Specifically, wefocus on the slippery slope argument and the ad hominem argument under theframeworks of Bayesian and pragma-dialectics approaches, respectively. We thinkemploying more descriptive and experimental accounts of argumentation would help Psychology to bring closer the cognitive and normative accounts of argumentation with the final goal of establishing an integrated area of research on thepsychology of argumentation.
 In general, social neuroscience research tends to focus on visual and auditorychannels as routes for social information. However, because the skin is the site of events and processes crucial to the way we think about, feel about, andinteract with one another, touch can mediate social perceptions in various ways. This review situates cutaneous perception within a social neuroscience framework by discussing evidence for considering touch (and to some extent pain) as achannel for social information. Social information conveys features ofindividuals or their interactions that have potential bearing on futureinteractions, and attendant mental and emotional states. Here, we discussevidence for an affective dimension of touch and explore its wider implicationsfor the exchange of social information. We consider three important roles forthis affective dimension of the cutaneous senses in the transmission andprocessing of social information: first, through affiliative behavior andcommunication; second, via affective processing in skin-brain pathways; andthird, as a basis for intersubjective representation.
 Oxytocin (OXT) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) are two phylogenetically conserved neuropeptides that have been implicated in a wide range of social behaviors.Although a large body of research, ranging from rodents to humans, has reportedon the effects of OXT and AVP administration on affiliative and trust behaviors, and has highlighted the genetic contributions of OXT and AVP receptorpolymorphisms to both social behaviors and to diseases related to socialdeficits, the consequences of peptide administration on psychiatric symptoms, andthe impact of receptor polymorphisms on receptor function, are still unclear.Despite the exciting advances that these reports have brought to socialneuroscience, they remain preliminary and suffer from the problems that areinherent to monogenetic linkage and association studies. As an alternative, some studies are using polygenic approaches, and consider the contributions of othergenes and pathways, including those involving DA, 5-HT, and reelin, in additionto OXT and AVP; a handful of report are also using genome-wide associationstudies. This review summarizes findings on the associations between OXT and AVP receptor polymorphism, social behavior, and psychiatric diseases. In addition, wediscuss reports on the interactions of OXT and AVP receptor genes and genesinvolved in other pathways (such as those of dopamine, serotonin, and reelin), aswell as research that has shed some light on the impact of gene polymorphisms on the volume, connectivity, and activation of specific neural structures,differential receptor expression, and plasma levels of the OXT and AVP peptides. We hope that this effort will be helpful for understanding the studies performed so far, and for encouraging the inclusion of other candidate genes not exploredto date.
 BACKGROUND: Mid-frontal and mid-lateral (F3/F4 and F7/F8) EEG asymmetry has been associated with motivation and affect. We examined alpha EEG asymmetry indepressed and healthy participants before and after Behavioral Activationtreatment for depression; examined the association between alpha EEG asymmetryand motivational systems and affect; and evaluated the utility of alpha EEGasymmetry in predicting remission. METHODS: Depressed (n=37) and healthyparticipants (n=35) were assessed before and after treatment using a clinicalinterview, a task to measure baseline EEG, and questionnaires of behavioralactivation and inhibition, avoidance, and affect. RESULTS: Alpha EEG asymmetrywas significantly higher in depressed than healthy participants at pre-treatment,positively correlated with negative affect and behavioral inhibition, andinversely correlated with lower behavioral activation sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS:Heightened alpha EEG asymmetry in depressed participants was significantlyassociated with increased behavioral inhibition and negative emotion and wasindependent of clinical remission.
 Loss of empathy is an early central symptom and diagnostic criterion of thebehavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Although changes in empathyare evident and strongly affect the social functioning of bvFTD patients, fewstudies have directly investigated this issue by means of experimental paradigms.The current study assessed multiple components of empathy (affective, cognitiveand moral) in bvFTD patients. We also explored whether the loss of empathyconstitutes a primary deficit of bvFTD or whether it is explained by impairments in executive functions (EF) or other social cognition domains. Thirty-seven bvFTDpatients with early/mild stages of the disease and 30 healthy controlparticipants were assessed with a task that involves the perception ofintentional and accidental harm. Participants were also evaluated on emotionrecognition, theory of mind (ToM), social norms knowledge and several EF domains.BvFTD patients presented deficits in affective, cognitive and moral aspects ofempathy. However, empathic concern was the only aspect primarily affected inbvFTD that was neither related nor explained by deficits in EF or other socialcognition domains. Deficits in the cognitive and moral aspects of empathy seem todepend on EF, emotion recognition and ToM. Our findings highlight the importance of using tasks depicting real-life social scenarios because of their greatersensitivity in the assessment of bvFTD. Moreover, our results contribute to theunderstanding of primary and intrinsic empathy deficits of bvFTD and haveimportant theoretical and clinical implications.
 Genes and social experiences interact to create variation in social behavior and vulnerability to develop disorders of the social domain. Socially monogamousprairie voles display remarkable diversity in neuropeptide receptor systems andsocial behavior. Here, we examine the interaction of early-life adversity andbrain oxytocin receptor (OTR) density on adult social attachment in femaleprairie voles. First, pups were isolated for 3 h per day, or unmanipulated, from postnatal day 1-14. Adult subjects were tested on the partner preference (PP)test to assess social attachment and OTR density in the brain was quantified.Neonatal social isolation impaired female PP formation, without affecting OTRdensity. Accumbal OTR density was, however, positively correlated with thepercent of time spent huddling with the partner in neonatally isolated females.Females with high accumbal OTR binding were resilient to neonatal isolation.These results are consistent with the hypothesis that parental nurturing shapesneural systems underlying social relationships by enhancing striatal OTRsignaling. Thus, we next determined whether early touch, mimicking parentallicking and grooming, stimulates hypothalamic OT neuron activity. Tactilestimulation induced immediate-early gene activity in OT neurons in neonates.Finally, we investigated whether pharmacologically potentiating OT release using a melanocortin 3/4 agonist, melanotan-II (10 mg kg(-1) subcutaneously), wouldmitigate the social isolation-induced impairments in attachment behavior.Neonatal melanotan-II administration buffered against the effects of earlyisolation on partner preference formation. Thus, variation in accumbal OTRdensity and early OT release induced by parental nurturing may moderatesusceptibility to early adverse experiences, including neglect.
 The pure exposure to extensive tactile stimulation, without the requirement ofattention or active training, has been revealed to enhance sensorimotorfunctioning presumably due to an induction of plasticity in the somatosensorycortex. The induced effects, including increased tactile acuity and manualdexterity have repeatedly been observed in basic as well as clinical research.However, results vary greatly in respect to the strength and direction of theeffects on the behavioral and on the brain level. Multiple evidences show thatdifferences in the stimulation protocols (e.g., two vs. multiple stimulationsites) and parameters (e.g., duration, frequency, and amplitude) might contributeto this variability of effects. Nevertheless, stimulation protocols have not beencomprehensively compared yet. Identifying favorable parameters for tactilestimulation interventions is especially important because of its possibleapplication as a treatment option for patients suffering from sensory loss,maladaptive plasticity, or certain forms of motor impairment. This review aims tocompare the effects of different tactile stimulation protocols and to assesspossible implications for tactile interventions. Our goal is to identify ways of optimizing stimulation protocols to improve sensorimotor performance. To thisend, we reviewed research on tactile stimulation in the healthy population, with a focus on the effectiveness of the applied parameters regardingpsychophysiological measures. We discuss the association of stimulation-inducedchanges on the behavioral level with alterations in neural representations andresponse characteristics.
 People say they enjoy both seeing a preferred social group succeed and seeing an adversary social group fail. At the same time, they state they dislike seeing apreferred social group fail and seeing an adversary social group succeed. Thecurrent magnetic resonance imaging study investigated whether-and if so, how-suchsimilarities in reported feeling states are reflected in neural activities.American football fans anticipated success and failure situations for theirfavorite or their adversary teams. The data support the idea that feelingsimilarities and divergences expressed in verbal reports carry with themsignificant neural similarities and differences, respectively. Desired (favorite team likely to win and adversary team likely to lose) rather than undesired(favorite team likely to lose and adversary team likely to win) outcomes wereassociated with heightened activity in the supramarginal gyrus, posteriorcingulate cortex, insula, and cerebellum. Precuneus activity additionallydistinguished anticipated desirable outcomes for favorite versus adversary teams.
 Social cognitive impairment is prominent in schizophrenia, and it is closelyrelated to functional outcome. Partly for these reasons, it has rapidly become a target for both training and psychopharmacological interventions. However, there is a paucity of reliable and valid social cognitive endpoints that can be used toevaluate treatment response in clinical trials. Also, clinical studies inschizophrenia have benefited rather little from the surge of activity andknowledge in nonclinical social neuroscience. The National Institute of MentalHealth-sponsored study, "Social Cognition and Functioning in Schizophrenia"(SCAF), attempted to address this translational challenge by selecting paradigms from social neuroscience that could be adapted for use in schizophrenia. Theproject also evaluated the psychometric properties and external validity of thetasks to determine their suitability for multisite clinical trials. This firstarticle in the theme section presents the goals, conceptual background, andrationale for the SCAF project.
 Obesity is a major concern in the aging population and degrades health, motorfunctions and cognition in older adults. The effects of obesity are pervasive andchallenging to health-care systems, making this a widespread and criticallyimportant public health dilemma. In this review, we examine the relationshipbetween obesity, cognitive aging, and related dysfunctions. Potential neuralmechanisms underlying such relationship are described. We propose thatcost-effective exercises can be employed to cope with obesity and cognitivedeclines in older adults. Finally, we discuss implications and future researchdirections.
 A population-based sample of Caucasians, African Americans, and Latino Americans,50-68 years of age (M = 57.5), from Cook County, Illinois (N = 229), was testedto examine how loneliness and co-occurring psychosocial factors (depressivesymptoms, perceived stress, social support, and hostility) were related toindices of cardiovascular and endocrine functioning. Extending prior research,the authors found that loneliness was associated with elevated systolic bloodpressure (SBP) and age-related increases in SBP, net of demographic variables,health behavior variables, and the remaining psychosocial factors. Loneliness wasnot associated with differences in autonomic or endocrine functioning. Althoughthe results are limited by the cross-sectional methods used, they are consistent with the hypothesis that cardiovascular disease contributes to increasedmorbidity and mortality among lonely individuals.
 The ratio of the length of the second and fourth digits (2D:4D ratio) isconsistently smaller in men than in women. Additionally, within each sex, smallerdigit ratios may be associated with higher testosterone levels and/or moremasculine attitudes and behaviors, although these findings are less consistent.We assessed 2D:4D ratios, together with measures of masculine attitudes andbehaviors, in an ethnically homogeneous population of 118 men and 103 women, aged21-38, all heterosexual and right-handed, in Beijing, China. In men, we alsomeasured salivary testosterone levels. As predicted, men displayed significantly smaller 2D:4D ratios than women (pB.0001 in both hands). Within each sex,however, 2D:4D ratios, measures of masculine characteristics, and salivarytestosterone showed no significant associations with one another. These latternull findings may partially reflect cultural differences in definitions of"masculinity".
 This study was designed to combine two, otherwise separated, fields of researchregarding motor resonance and mimicry by adopting a naturalistic mimicry paradigmwhile probing motor resonance with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Atstake was whether the motor system resonates instantaneously with unobtrusivenonverbal behavior of another person. We measured excitability in the left andright hand while participants viewed sequences of video clips and static images. In the video clips an actor performed several clerical tasks, while eitherinconspicuously touching his face (face-touching (FT) condition) or not (noface-touching (NFT) condition). We found that excitability was higher in the FTcondition than in the NFT and baseline conditions. Furthermore, our data showed ageneral heightened excitability in the left motor cortex relative to the right.Taken together, the results suggest that observed hand-face gestures--even thoughoutside the primary focus of attention and occurring inconspicuously throughoutan ongoing action setting--can cause instantaneous resonant activity in theobserver's motor system. It thus supports the idea of motor resonance involvementin mimicry and demonstrates that this can be studied using a naturalistic mimicryparadigm.
 Neural activities triggered by viewing other's in pain have been previouslyreported to be modulated by various factors. How instructions of cooperation and competition can influence these activities has not been explored yet. In thecurrent study, participants were instructed to play a game cooperatively orcompetitively with a partner. During the game, pictures showing an anonymousindividual's hand or foot in painful or non-painful situations were randomlypresented in an oddball style. The event-related potentials (ERPs) when theparticipants passively observed these pictures under different instructions were compared. We found a significant interaction of Instruction x Picture on the P3component, where only under competitive instruction did the painful pictureselicit significantly larger amplitudes than the non-painful pictures, but notunder the cooperative instruction. This result indicates that the participantswere more responsive to other's pain in a competitive context than in acooperative context.
 Humans are fundamentally social and tend to create emergent organizations wheninteracting with each other; from dyads to families, small groups, large groups, societies, and civilizations. The study of the neuronal substrate of human socialbehavior is currently gaining momentum in the young field of social neuroscience.Hyperscanning is a neuroimaging technique by which we can study two or morebrains simultaneously while participants interact with each other. The aim ofthis article is to discuss several factors that we deem important in designinghyperscanning experiments. We first review hyperscanning studies performed bymeans of electroencephalography (EEG) that have been relying on a continuousinteraction paradigm. Then, we provide arguments for favoring ecologicalparadigms, for studying the emotional component of social interactions and forperforming longitudinal studies, the last two aspects being largely neglected so far in the hyperscanning literature despite their paramount importance in social sciences. Based on these premises, we argue that music performance is a suitable experimental setting for hyperscanning and that for such studies EEG is anappropriate choice as neuroimaging modality.
 Over 70 years since the first description of the disease, disrupted socialbehavior remains a core clinical feature of autistic spectrum disorder. Thecomplex etiology of the disorder portends the need for a better understanding of the brain mechanisms that enable social behaviors, particularly those that arerelevant to autism which is characterized by a failure to develop peerrelationships, difficulty with emotional reciprocity and imitative play, anddisrupted language and communication skills. Toward this end, the current review will examine recent progress that has been made toward understanding the neuralmechanisms underlying consociate social attachments.
 Schilbach et al. contrast second-person and third-person approaches to socialneuroscience. We discuss relations between second-person and first-personapproaches, arguing that they cannot be studied in isolation. Contingency iscentral for converging first- and second-person approaches. Studies of embodimentshow how contingencies scaffold first-person perspective and how the transitionfrom a third- to a second-person perspective fundamentally involves first-person contributions.
 The last decade has seen a surge of interest in the study of social brainfunctions. Research in this field, called social neuroscience, has been mostlycarried out on human subjects by using a functional neuroimaging technique. This is largely because of the fact that humans have sophisticated social abilitiesand are capable of performing various demanding tasks in a scanner. However,given the limited spatiotemporal resolution inherent in the methodology, asystems neuroscience approach using macaque monkeys may provide a useful platformthat promotes the understanding of social brain functions at the cellular level, thereby complementing neuroimaging techniques. Recently, it has been demonstratedto be technically feasible to train macaque monkeys to perform socially oriented behavioral tasks and directly examine cellular activity in their brains. In this paper, we review the literature on this new branch of social neuroscience.Emerging evidence now suggests that diverse aspects of social cognition, such as social valuation, gaze following, joint attention, monitoring of other'sbehavior, and social comparison are implemented by distributed neuronal networks,including the orbital, lateral, and medial sectors of the prefrontal cortex,premotor cortex, posterior parietal cortex, amygdala, and superior temporalsulcus. Continuing efforts in this research direction could uncover the neuralbasis whereby primates have become such successful social beings in the animalkingdom.
 Unlike other primates, humans can regulate their own minds and brains andestablish the self, which are based on language acquisition and socialreciprocity. This capacity for self-regulation is evolutionarily realized by the highly developed neocortex and developmentally matures during adolescence.Inappropriate maturation of the neural systems responsible for self-regulation inadolescence could lead to the emergence of psychiatric disorders, such asschizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric disorder, the onset of which usually takes place during adolescence/youth; one of its core features isdisturbance of self-related information processing. Although schizophrenia hasbeen associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities during the perinatalperiod, recently improved neuroimaging techniques have shown progressivedeterioration in the structure and function of neocortical regions in theprodromal and first-episode stages of the disorder. These reconsiderations havestimulated neurobiological investigations into the normal developmental processand its disturbance of the glutamatergic/synaptic system in adolescence. Of late,clinical psychiatry has been seeking early intervention strategies by integratingbiological and psychosocial approaches. By integrating epidemiology, socialneuroscience, and psychiatry, we aim to establish a new interdisciplinary scienceto uncover the developmental mechanisms of self-regulation in adolescence andcreate supportive and preventive strategies, which will ultimately contribute to education and society.
 This research investigated the automatic imitation of facial expressions of angerby in-group and out-group members, using a temporal estimation task. Individuals typically overestimate duration represented by angry faces, probably due toincreases in arousal (Droit-Volet, Brunot, & Niedenthal, 2004). Overestimation isnot observed when imitation of the facial expressions is inhibited, suggestingthat embodied simulation mediates the changes in arousal (Effron, Niedenthal,Gil, & Droit-Volet, 2006). This method thus provides an implicit measure ofimitation and was used to test the hypothesis that individuals imitate in-group, but not out-group members' facial expressions of emotion. In separate studiesChinese and French Caucasian participants were presented with short (400 ms) and long (1600 ms) standard durations in a temporal bisection task. They thencategorized standard and intermediate durations, represented by angry and neutralfaces, in terms of similarity to the short and long standard durations. Half ofthe face stimuli were Chinese, and half Caucasian. Results revealed a bias in thetemporal perception of emotion for the Caucasian participants when they werepresented with Caucasian facial expressions and not Chinese ones. In contrast,this bias in time perception was observed when Chinese individuals imitated facesof both in- and out-group members. The results of the Chinese participants areinterpreted in terms of familiarity with and motivations to understand theemotional expressions of members of a host culture.
 Turner syndrome (TS) is a chromosomal disorder of X-monosomy in females. Aminority have impaired social responsiveness, poor discrimination of facialemotions (especially fear), and abnormal amygdala-cortical connectivity. Wetested the hypothesis that abnormal gaze fixation, especially with the eye regionof faces, would be associated with these features, in a similar pattern to thatseen in subjects with autism. Furthermore, since these features tend to be morestriking in TS women whose X chromosome is maternal in origin, we also predicted that there may be a difference within the Turner's group according to parentalorigin of the single X. Adults with 45,X karyotype and age and IQ matched 46,XXwomen were recruited and tested. Facial fear recognition was significantly worse in 45,X females than controls, but there were no group differences according toparental origin of their single X chromosome. Subsequently, we tested 45,X and46,XX women using a remote eye-tracking device, as they viewed photographs ofemotional human faces. Striking differences in scanpaths were found between theTS and controls, and within the TS group, but not according to parental origin ofthe X chromosome. These findings provide novel evidence for abnormal faceprocessing in some women with TS, and indicate a potential neural mechanismunderlying the difficulties in some key aspects of social cognition.
 Functional imaging studies have identified a network of brain regions associated with theory of mind (ToM); the attribution of mental states to other people.Similar regions have also been observed in studies where people play games thatinvolve either competing or co-operating with another person. Such games arethought to place implicit demands on ToM processes. Co-operation with others has also been shown to elicit brain responses in areas associated with the processingof reward, suggesting that co-operation is an intrinsically rewarding process. Inthis study, we used a factorial design to assess the interaction betweenco-operation and the availability of financial rewards in a guessing game. Twelvesubjects were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) whilethey performed a guessing game with and without co-operation, and under boththese conditions with and without financial reward. The main effect ofco-operation was associated with neural responses in theory of mind regions,while the main effect of financial reward was associated with neural responses inreward regions. Critically the response to reward in medial orbitofrontal cortex was significantly enhanced when subjects were co-operating. This suggests thatrewards achieved through co-operation are more valuable than rewards achievedalone.
 Social neuroscience has called for new experimental paradigms aimed towardreal-time interactions. A distinctive feature of interactions is mutualinformation exchange: One member of a pair changes in response to the other whilesimultaneously producing actions that alter the other. Combining mathematical andneurophysiological methods, we introduce a paradigm called the human dynamicclamp (HDC), to directly manipulate the interaction or coupling between a humanand a surrogate constructed to behave like a human. Inspired by the dynamic clampused so productively in cellular neuroscience, the HDC allows a person tointeract in real time with a virtual partner itself driven by well-establishedmodels of coordination dynamics. People coordinate hand movements with thevisually observed movements of a virtual hand, the parameters of which depend on input from the subject's own movements. We demonstrate that HDC can be extendedto cover a broad repertoire of human behavior, including rhythmic and discretemovements, adaptation to changes of pacing, and behavioral skill learning asspecified by a virtual "teacher." We propose HDC as a general paradigm, bestimplemented when empirically verified theoretical or mathematical models havebeen developed in a particular scientific field. The HDC paradigm is powerfulbecause it provides an opportunity to explore parameter ranges and perturbations that are not easily accessible in ordinary human interactions. The HDC not onlyenables to test the veracity of theoretical models, it also illuminates features that are not always apparent in real-time human social interactions and the braincorrelates thereof.
 Low socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with higher levels ofallostatic load (AL). Posited mechanisms for this association include stress,personality, psychosocial variables, coping, social networks, and healthbehaviors. This study examines whether these variables explain the SES-ALrelationship in a population-based sample of 208 51- to 69-year-old White, Black,and Hispanic adults in the Chicago Health, Aging, and Social Relations Study. AL was based on nine markers of physiological dysregulation. SES was inverselyassociated with a composite measure of AL; hostility and poor sleep qualityhelped to explain the association between AL and SES. Factor analyses revealedfour AL components corresponding to the bodily systems of interest. SES wassignificantly associated with two AL components, suggesting that the effects ofSES on physiological dysregulation are specific to certain systems in a middle toearly old-age population.
 BACKGROUND: Male-male competition and female mating preference are majormechanisms of sexual selection, which influences individual fitness. Howmale-male competition affects female preference, however, remains poorlyunderstood. Under laboratory conditions, medaka (Oryzias latipes) males competeto position themselves between a rival male and the female (mate-guarding) intriadic relationships (male, male, and female). In addition, females prefer tomate with visually familiar males. In the present study, to examine whethermate-guarding affects female preference via visual familiarization, weestablished a novel behavioral test to simultaneously quantify visualfamiliarization of focal males with females and mate-guarding against rivalmales. In addition, we investigated the effect of familiarization on malereproductive success in triadic relationships. RESULTS: Three fish (female, male,male) were placed separately in a transparent three-chamber tank, which allowedthe male in the center (near male) to maintain closer proximity to the femalethan the other male (far male). Placement of the wild-type male in the centerblocked visual familiarization of the far male by the female via mate-guarding.In contrast, placement of an arginine-vasotocin receptor mutant male, whichexhibits mate-guarding deficits, in the center, allowing for maintaining closeproximity to the female, did not block familiarization of the far male by thefemale. We also demonstrated that the reproductive success of males wassignificantly decreased by depriving females visual familiarization with themales. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that, at least in triadicrelationships, dominance in mate-guarding, not simply close proximity, allowsmales to gain familiarity with the female over their rivals, which may enhancefemale preference for the dominant male. These findings focusing on the triadicrelationships of medaka may contribute to our understanding of the adaptivesignificance of persistent mate-guarding, as well as female preference forfamiliar mates.
 Recent research evidences supported the significant role of multimethodologicalneuroscientific approach for the diagnosis and the rehabilitative intervention inschizophrenia. Indeed both electrophysiological and neuroimaging measures inintegration each other appear able to furnish a deep overview of the cognitiveand affective behavior in schizophrenia patients (SPs). The aim of the presentreview is focused on the emotional dysfunctional response taking into account themultimeasures for emotional behavior, i.e., the event-related potentials (ERPs)and the hemodynamic profile functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). These measures may be considered as predictive measures of the SPs' deficits inemotional behavior. The integration between ERP and fNIRS may support both theprefrontal cortical localization anomaly and the attentional bias toward somespecific emotional conditions (mainly negative).
 In the present review, the phenomenon of ultrasonic vocalization in rats will be outlined, including the three classes of vocalizations, namely 40-kHz calls ofpups, and 22- and 50-kHz calls of juvenile and adult rats, their generalrelevance to behavioral neuroscience, and their special relevance to research on anxiety, fear, and defense mechanisms. Here, the emphasis will be placed on 40-and 22-kHz calls, since they are typical for various situations with aversiveproperties. Among other topics, we will discuss whether such behavioral signalscan index a certain affective state, and how these signals can be used in social neuroscience, especially with respect to communication. Furthermore, we willaddress the phenomenon of inter-individual variability in ultrasonic calling and what we currently know about the mechanisms, which may determine suchvariability. Finally, we will address the current knowledge on the neural andpharmacological mechanisms underlying 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalization, which show a substantial overlap with mechanisms known from other research on fear andanxiety, such as those involving the periaqueductal gray or the amygdala.
 Although dystonia has traditionally been regarded as a basal ganglia dysfunction,recent provocative evidence has emerged of cerebellar involvement in thepathophysiology of this enigmatic disease. This review synthesizes the datasuggesting that the cerebellum plays an important role in dystonia etiology, fromneuroanatomical research of complex networks showing that the cerebellum isconnected to a wide range of other central nervous system structures involved in movement control to animal models indicating that signs of dystonia are due tocerebellum dysfunction and completely disappear after cerebellectomy, and finallyto clinical observations in secondary dystonia patients with various types ofcerebellar lesions. We propose that dystonia is a large-scale dysfunction,involving not only cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical pathways, but thecortico-ponto-cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop as well. Even in the absence oftraditional "cerebellar signs" in most dystonia patients, there are more subtleindications of cerebellar dysfunction. It is clear that as long as thecerebellum's role in dystonia genesis remains unexamined, it will be difficult tosignificantly improve the current standards of dystonia treatment or to providecurative treatment.
 Using event-related potentials, we investigated how the brain extractsinformation from another's face and translates it into relevant action in realtime. In Study 1, participants made between-hand sex categorizations ofsex-typical and sex-atypical faces. Sex-atypical faces evoked negativity between 250 and 550 ms (N300/N400 effects), reflecting the integration of accumulatingsex-category knowledge into a coherent sex-category interpretation. Additionally,the lateralized readiness potential revealed that the motor cortex beganpreparing for a correct hand response while social category knowledge was stillgradually evolving in parallel. In Study 2, participants made between-handeye-color categorizations as part of go/no-go trials that were contingent on atarget's sex. On no-go trials, although the hand did not actually move,information about eye color partially prepared the motor cortex to move the hand before perception of sex had finalized. Together, these findings demonstrate the dynamic continuity between person perception and action, such that ongoingresults from face processing are immediately and continuously cascaded into themotor system over time. The preparation of action begins based on tentativeperceptions of another's face before perceivers have finished interpreting whatthey just saw.
 Social neuroscience has been enormously successful and is making majorcontributions to fields ranging from psychiatry to economics. Yet deep andinteresting conceptual challenges abound. Is social information processing domainspecific? Is it universal or susceptible to individual differences and effects ofculture? Are there uniquely human social cognitive abilities? What is the "socialbrain," and how do we map social psychological processes onto it? Animal modelstogether with fMRI and other cognitive neuroscience approaches in humans areproviding an unprecedented level of detail and many surprising results. It maywell be that social neuroscience in the near future will give us an entirely new view of who we are, how we evolved, and what might be in store for the future of our species.
 EEG Hyperscanning is a method for studying two or more individuals simultaneouslywith the objective of elucidating how co-variations in their neural activity(i.e., hyperconnectivity) are influenced by their behavioral and socialinteractions. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of differenthyper-connectivity measures using (i) simulated data, where the degree ofcoupling could be systematically manipulated, and (ii) individually recordedhuman EEG combined into pseudo-pairs of participants where no hyper-connectionscould exist. With simulated data we found that each of the most widely usedmeasures of hyperconnectivity were biased and detected hyper-connections wherenone existed. With pseudo-pairs of human data we found spurious hyper-connectionsthat arose because there were genuine similarities between the EEG recorded from different people independently but under the same experimental conditions.Specifically, there were systematic differences between experimental conditionsin terms of the rhythmicity of the EEG that were common across participants. Asany imbalance between experimental conditions in terms of stimulus presentationor movement may affect the rhythmicity of the EEG, this problem could apply inmany hyperscanning contexts. Furthermore, as these spurious hyper-connectionsreflected real similarities between the EEGs, they were not Type-1 errors thatcould be overcome by some appropriate statistical control. However, some measuresthat have not previously been used in hyperconnectivity studies, notably thecircular correlation co-efficient (CCorr), were less susceptible to detectingspurious hyper-connections of this type. The reason for this advantage inperformance is discussed and the use of the CCorr as an alternative measure ofhyperconnectivity is advocated.
 Inspired by the basic concepts of neuroscience, neuropsychiatry is a disciplineat the interface between psychiatry, psychology, neurology and neuropathology.Interestingly, neuropsychiatry can also include specialized disciplines, such as developmental psychology, endocrinology and sexology. In this article, wedescribe the neuropsychiatric approach and present how it may be related tosocial neuroscience, and apply to sexual medicine by describing its importancefor sexual dysfunctions and sexual desire.
 The current research examined the influence of ingroup/outgroup categorization onbrain event-related potentials measured during perceptual processing of own- and other-race faces. White participants performed a sequential matching task withupright and inverted faces belonging either to their own race (White) or toanother race (Black) and affiliated with either their own university or anotheruniversity by a preceding visual prime. Results demonstrated that theright-lateralized N170 component evoked by test faces was modulated by race andby social category: the N170 to own-race faces showed a larger inversion effect(i.e., latency delay for inverted faces) when the faces were categorized asother-university rather than own-university members; the N170 to other-race facesshowed no modulation of its inversion effect by university affiliation. Theseresults suggest that neural correlates of structural face encoding (as evidenced by the N170 inversion effects) can be modulated by both visual (racial) andnonvisual (social) ingroup/outgroup status.
 Appropriately attending to threatening environmental stimuli is evolutionarilyadaptive and crucial for survival. This study revealed that nonconsciousattentional modulation of disgust has different behavioral and event-relatedpotential (ERP) patterns, as compared to fear and anger. To facilitate itsevolutionary purpose of avoidance, disgust first diverts rather than attractsattention. Accordingly, the N1 was smaller in a validly than in an invalidlydisgust-cued condition. Furthermore, the frontal P3a for disgust, anger, and fearwas found to be larger in the valid than in the invalid condition, which wasinterpreted as an involuntary switching of attention toward threat-related eventsto mobilize cognitive resources for action or defense. On the contrary, theparietal P3b only occurred at the conscious level; the enhanced P3b indicatedthat more cognitive resources were being allocated toward the task-relevant butpreviously less attended location, to ensure the effective achievement of taskgoals. In addition, group comparisons between individuals with low and highdisgust sensitivity showed that the ERP differences between the disgust and theanger/fear conditions at the unconscious level may be attributed only toindividuals with high disgust sensitivity. These findings, together with previousknowledge of the effects of fear and anger on attention, strengthen ourconfidence in the two-stage scheme of attentional modulation by threats, whichconsists of an early stage of bottom-up response scaling of sensory processing(reflected by the P1 and N1) and a later stage of top-down integration andregulation of emotion and behavior (reflected by the P3).
 Social perception is an important prerequisite for successful social interaction,because it helps to gain information about behaviors, thoughts, and feelings ofinteraction partners. Previous pharmacological studies have emphasized therelevance of the oxytocin system for social perception abilities, while knowledgeon genetic contributions is still scarce. In the endeavor to fill this gap in theliterature, the current study searches for associations between participants'social perception abilities as measured by the interpersonal perception task(IPT) and the rs2268498 polymorphism on the OXTR-gene, which has repeatedly been linked to processes relevant to social functioning. N = 105 healthy participants were experimentally tested with the IPT and genotyped for the rs2268498polymorphism. T-allele carriers (TT and TC genotypes) exhibited significantlybetter performance in the IPT than carriers of the CC-genotype. This differencewas also significant for the subscales measuring the strength of social bonding(kinship and intimacy). As in previous studies, T-allele carriers exhibitedbetter performance in measures of social processing indicating that the rs2268498polymorphism is an important candidate for understanding the genetic basis ofsocial functioning.
 Social exclusion, ostracism, and rejection can be emotionally painful becausethey thwart the need to belong. Building on studies suggesting that the rightventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC) is associated with regulation ofnegative emotions, the present experiment tests the hypothesis that decreasingthe cortical excitability of the rVLPFC may increase negative emotional reactionsto social exclusion. Specifically, we applied cathodal transcranial directcurrent stimulation (tDCS) over the rVLPFC and predicted an increment of negativeemotional reactions to social exclusion. In Study 1, participants were eithersocially excluded or included, while cathodal tDCS or sham stimulation wasapplied over the rVLPFC. Cathodal stimulation of rVLPFC boosted the typicalnegative emotional reaction caused by social exclusion. No effects emerged fromparticipants in the inclusion condition. To test the specificity of tDCS effects over rVLPFC, in Study 2, participants were socially excluded and receivedcathodal tDCS or sham stimulation over a control region (i.e., the rightposterior parietal cortex). No effects of tDCS stimulation were found. Ourresults showed that the rVLPFC is specifically involved in emotion regulation andsuggest that cathodal stimulation can increase negative emotional responses tosocial exclusion.
 Understanding the temporal dynamics of brain function contributes to models oflearning and memory as well as the processing of emotions and habituation. Inthis article, we present a novel analysis technique to investigate spatiotemporalpatterns of activation in response to blocked presentations of emotional stimuli.We modeled three temporal response functions (TRFs), which were maximallysensitive to the onset, early or sustained temporal component of a given blocktype. This analysis technique was applied to a data set of 29 subjects whounderwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while responding to fearful,happy, and sad facial expressions. We identified brain regions that uniquely fit each of the three TRFs for each emotional condition and compared the results tothe standard approach, which was based on the canonical hemodynamic responsefunction. We found that voxels within the precuneus fit the onset TRF but did notfit the early or the sustained TRF in all the emotional conditions. On the other hand, voxels within the amygdala fit the sustained TRF, but not the onset orearly TRF, during presentation of fearful stimuli, suggesting a spatiotemporaldissociation between these structures. This technique provides researchers withan additional tool in order to investigate the temporal dynamics of neuralcircuits.
 Neuroscience is young and still developing. It is quickly adapting to a number ofemerging changes in science and education. Not only have neuroscientists been at the forefront of the open access publishing movement, but many prominentneuroscientists continue to push towards making science more accessible andunderstandable to the broader public. Social media is a global phenomenon that ischanging the way that we talk about research and education. Researchers,students, and the public alike can leverage social media to find updates inresearch and higher education. Social media also provides pathways to connectwith experts and non-experts in a way never been seen before. Two major trendsare appearing in education and social media: 1) providing more engaging teaching activities, and 2) providing opportunities for community engagement usingteaching activities that leverage social media. In this article, we describe asemester long teaching activity that challenged students to use social media intheir learning process. We provide initial evaluation and feedback from thestudents on their social media experience in class, and suggestions for how toimprove the project in future implementations.
 This study investigated the neural mechanisms involved in the interpersonaleffects of emotions--i.e., how people are influenced by other people's emotions. Participants were allocators in a version of the dictator game and made a choice between two offers after receiving written emotional expressions of therecipients. The results showed that participants more often made a self-servingoffer when dealing with an angry recipient than when dealing with a happy ordisappointed recipient. Compared to disappointment, expressions of angerincreased activation in regions associated with self-referential thinking(anterior medial prefrontal cortex, aMPFC) and (emotional) conflict (anteriorcingulate cortex). We found increased activation in temporoparietal junction for receiving happy reactions in comparison with receiving angry or disappointedreactions. This study thus emphasizes that distinct emotions have distincteffects on people in terms of behavior and underlying neurological mechanisms.
 INTRODUCTION: The functional neuroimaging literature has used many stimuli (e.g.,games, pictures, sounds) in fMRI studies to induce activation in brain areasrelated to psychological processes. To improve the link among psychologicalprocesses and their brain mapping, this study integrates the theory ofmeasurement in the social sciences with the functional neuroimaging literature topropose a simple method that localizes the neural correlates of psychologicalprocesses using psychometric scales as stimuli to induce brain activation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two fMRI studies were performed to illustrate this method with 30 subjects who responded to psychometric scales for four psychologicalprocesses on 7-point Likert-type anchors while their brains were being scanned inan fMRI. The first study examined two psychological processes-trust anddistrust-whose neural correlates are known. The second study examined twopsychological processes specific to technology use context-perceived usefulnessand perceived ease of use-whose neural correlates are still unknown. RESULTS:Results from the first fMRI study confirmed the neural correlates of trust in thecaudate nucleus, putamen, anterior paracingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortexand of distrust in the amygdala and insular cortex, thus confirming theliterature. The second fMRI study identified the neural correlates of perceivedusefulness in the anterior cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus, and insular cortex and perceived ease of use in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which areconsistent with the technology use literature. DISCUSSION: The proposed brainmapping method with psychometric scales can inform the neurological nature ofpsychological processes, challenge existing measurement assumptions, and helpadvance brain mapping.
 Group membership is an important aspect of our everyday behavior. Recently, weshowed that existing relevant in-group labels increased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) compared with out-group labels, suggesting a role of theMPFC in social categorization. However, the question still remains whether thisincrease in MPFC activation for in-group representation is solely related withprevious experience with the in-group. To test this, we randomly assignedparticipants to a red or blue team and in a subsequent functional magneticresonance imaging experiment they categorized red and blue team words asbelonging to either the in-group or the out-group. Results showed that even underthese minimal conditions increased activation was found in the MPFC whenparticipants indicated that they belonged to a group, as compared with when they did not. This effect was found to be associated with the level of groupidentification. These results confirm the role of MPFC in social categorization.
 The neuroscience of morality has focused on how morality works and where it is inthe brain. In tackling these questions, researchers have taken bothdomain-specific and domain-general approaches-searching for neural substrates andsystems dedicated to moral cognition versus characterizing the contributions ofdomain-general processes. Where in the brain is morality? On one hand, moralityis made up of complex cognitive processes, deployed across many domains andhoused all over the brain. On the other hand, no neural substrate or system that uniquely supports moral cognition has been found. In this review, we will discussearly assumptions of domain-specificity in moral neuroscience as well assubsequent investigations of domain-general contributions, taking emotion andsocial cognition (i.e., theory of mind) as case studies. Finally, we willconsider possible cognitive accounts of a domain-specific morality: Does uniquelymoral cognition exist?
 Recently, a standardized program for training of affect recognition (TAR) wasdeveloped which has demonstrated efficacy and specificity with respect tobehavioral performance. The effects of the TAR on the cerebral correlates wereevaluated using repeated fMRI event-related measurements in a group ofschizophrenia patients (n=10) before and after TAR treatment six weeks apart. Asecond patient group without training (n=10, treatment as usual, TAU) as well as healthy subjects (n=10) were investigated at equivalent time points.Schizophrenia patients were shown to be differentially impaired in theidentification of the emotional aspects of facial expressions (but not agediscrimination) when compared with healthy participants. A specific improvementin the increased number of correct identifications was observed in trainedpatients only. In parallel, an increase in activation was noted in the leftmiddle and superior occipital lobe, the right inferior and superior parietalcortex, and the inferior frontal cortex bilaterally in TAR patients compared tothe TAU group. These activation changes in TAR patients correlated with theirbehavioral improvement, further corroborating the positive effect of training.Specific training effects are seen to correspond with cerebral effects, probably reflecting a more efficient use of attentional, perceptual, or cognitivestrategies.
 Perceived social isolation (PSI), colloquially known as loneliness, is associatedwith selectively altered attentional, cognitive, and affective processes inhumans, but the neural mechanisms underlying these adjustments remain largelyunexplored. Behavioral, eye tracking, and neuroimaging research has identifiedassociations between PSI and implicit hypervigilance for social threats.Additionally, selective executive dysfunction has been evidenced by reducedprepotent response inhibition in social Stroop and dichotic listening tasks.Given that PSI is associated with pre-attentional processes, PSI may also berelated to altered resting-state functional connectivity (FC) in the brain.Therefore, we conducted the first resting-state fMRI FC study of PSI in healthyyoung adults. Five-minute resting-state scans were obtained from 55 participants (31 females). Analyses revealed robust associations between PSI and increasedbrain-wide FC in areas encompassing the right central operculum and rightsupramarginal gyrus, and these associations were not explained by depressivesymptomatology, objective isolation, or demographics. Further analyses revealedthat PSI was associated with increased FC between several nodes of thecingulo-opercular network, a network known to underlie the maintenance of tonicalertness. These regions encompassed the bilateral insula/frontoparietal operculaand ACC/pre-SMA. In contrast, FC between the cingulo-opercular network and right middle/superior frontal gyrus was reduced, a finding associated with diminishedexecutive function in prior literature. We suggest that, in PSI, increasedwithin-network cingulo-opercular FC may be associated with hypervigilance tosocial threat, whereas reduced right middle/superior frontal gyrus FC to thecingulo-opercular network may be associated with diminished impulse control.
 Previous evidence indicates that we understand others' actions not only byperceiving their visual features but also by their sound. This raises thepossibility that brain regions responsible for action understanding respond tocues coming from different sensory modalities. Yet no studies, to date, haveexamined if this extends to olfaction. Here we addressed this issue by usingfunctional magnetic resonance imaging. We searched for brain activity related to the observation of an action executed towards an object that was smelled ratherthan seen. The results show that temporal, parietal, and frontal areas wereactivated when individuals observed a hand grasping a smelled object. Thisactivity differed from that evoked during the observation of a mimed grasp.Furthermore, superadditive activity was revealed when the action target-objectwas both seen and smelled. Together these findings indicate the influence ofolfaction on action understanding and its contribution to multimodal actionrepresentations.
 Social categorization is the foundation of stereotype activation, and the processfrom social categorization to stereotype activation is rapid. However, the timefrom social categorization to stereotype activation is unknown. This studyinvolves a real-time measurement of the time course of gender-stereotypeactivation beginning with gender categorization using event-related potentialtechnology with a face as the priming stimulus. We found that 195 ms after a facestimulus was presented, brain waves stimulated by male or female gendercategorization showed a clear separation, with male faces stimulating larger N200waves. In addition, 475 ms after a face stimulus appeared or 280 ms after thegendercategorization process occurred, gender-stereotype-consistent andgender-stereotype-inconsistent stimuli were distinct, withgender-stereotype-inconsistent stimuli inducing larger N400 waves. These results indicate that during gender-stereotype activation by face perception, gendercategorization occurs approximately 195 ms after seeing a face stimulus and agender stereotype is activated at approximately 475 ms.
 Accumulating evidence suggests that the brain can efficiently process bothexternal and internal information. The processing of internal information is adistinct "offline" cognitive mode that requires not only spontaneously generated mental activity; it has also been hypothesized to require a decoupling ofattention from perception in order to separate competing streams of internal and external information. This process of decoupling is potentially adaptive because it could prevent unimportant external events from disrupting an internal train ofthought. Here, we use measurements of pupil diameter (PD) to provide concreteevidence for the role of decoupling during spontaneous cognitive activity. First,during periods conducive to offline thought but not during periods of task focus,PD exhibited spontaneous activity decoupled from task events. Second, periodsrequiring external task focus were characterized by large task evoked changes in PD; in contrast, encoding failures were preceded by episodes of high spontaneous baseline PD activity. Finally, high spontaneous PD activity also occurred priorto only the slowest 20% of correct responses, suggesting high baseline PD indexesa distinct mode of cognitive functioning. Together, these data are consistentwith the decoupling hypothesis, which suggests that the capacity for spontaneous cognitive activity depends upon minimizing disruptions from the external world.
 The complexity of social perception poses a challenge to traditional approachesto understand its psychological and neurobiological underpinnings. Data-drivenmethods are particularly well suited to tackling the often high-dimensionalnature of stimulus spaces and of neural representations that characterize social perception. Such methods are more exploratory, capitalize on rich and largedatasets, and attempt to discover patterns often without strict hypothesistesting. We present four case studies here: behavioural studies on facejudgements, two neuroimaging studies of movies, and eyetracking studies inautism. We conclude with suggestions for particular topics that seem ripe fordata-driven approaches, as well as caveats and limitations.
 There is growing evidence that the serotonin system influences prosocialbehavior. We examined whether anxiety mediated the association between variation in the serotonin transporter gene regulatory region (5-HTTLPR) and prosocialbehavior. We collected self-reported tendencies to avoid certain situations andhistory of helping others using standard instruments and buccal cells forstandard 5-HTTLPR genotyping from 398 undergraduate students. Triallelic 5-HTTLPRgenotype was significantly associated with prosocial behavior and the effect was partially mediated by social anxiety, such that those carrying the S' allelereported higher levels of social avoidance and lower rates of helping others.These results are consistent with accounts of the role of serotonin on anxietyand prosocial behavior and suggest that targeted efforts to reduce social anxietyin S' allele carriers may enhance prosocial behavior.
 Although cognitive neuroscience has made remarkable progress in understanding theinvolvement of the prefrontal cortex in executive control functions for humanintelligence, the necessity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) for keycompetencies of general intelligence and executive function remains to be wellestablished. Here we studied human brain lesion patients with dlPFC lesions toinvestigate whether this region is computationally necessary for performance onneuropsychological tests of general intelligence and executive function,administering the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and subtests of theDelis Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) to three groups: dlPFC lesions(n=19), non-dlPFC lesions (n=152), and no brain lesions (n=55). The resultsindicate that: (1) patients with focal dlPFC damage exhibit lower scores, at the latent variable level, than controls in general intelligence (g) and executivefunction; (2) dlPFC patients demonstrate lower scores than controls in severalexecutive measures; and (3) these latter differences are no longer significantwhen the pervasive influence of the general factor of intelligence (g) isstatistically removed. The observed findings support a central role for the dlPFCin global aspects of general intelligence and make specific recommendations forthe interpretation and application of the WAIS and D-KEFS to the study ofhigh-level cognition in health and disease.
 Although universal, lying is generally considered immoral behavior. Mostneuroscience studies on lying sanction or instruct deceptive behaviors and thusmight fail to acknowledge the significance of lie-related moral conflicts. Bycombining electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings with a novel paradigm in whichparticipants decided freely whether to deceive another person, we have generated indices of the cognitive (reaction times and stimulus-locked event-relatedcomponents) and moral (readiness potential and its correlations withdeception-related personality traits) cost of spontaneous deception. Our datafail to support the consensus that deception is cognitively more demanding thantruth telling, suggesting that spontaneous deception, as opposed to lying out of requirement, might not mandate additional cognitive workload. Interestingly,lying was associated with decreased motor readiness, an event-related potential(ERP) component that is linked to motor preparation of self-determined actionsand modulated when we face moral dilemmas. Notably, this reduction was lessextensive in manipulative participants and greater in those who cared highlyabout their impression management. Our study expands on previous findings ondeception by associating a cortical marker of reduced preparation to act withindividual differences in moral cognition.
 Previous research has demonstrated that an early attentional component of theevent-related potential (ERP), the P2, is sensitive to the distinction betweenthe processing of racial outgroup and ingroup faces but may not be sensitive tothe distinction between racially ambiguous and ingroup faces. Recent behavioralwork, however, has suggested that contextual information may affect theprocessing of racially ambiguous faces. Thus, the first goal of this study was toexamine whether the early neural processing of racially ambiguous faces would be affected by primed stereotypes. White college student participants (n = 29)completed a task in which they racially categorized monoracial Black and Whitefaces and racially ambiguous Black-White morphs. These faces were preceded bypositive and negative Black and White stereotypical primes. Results indicatedthat P2 amplitude to the racially ambiguous faces was moderated by the valence ofthe primes such that negative primes led to greater neural processing of theracially ambiguous faces than positive primes. Furthermore, the extent to whichP2 amplitude was affected by prime valence was moderated by individualdifferences in preference for structure and categorical thinking, as well ascomfort with ambiguity.
 Background Acute stroke care represents a challenge for decision makers. Recentrandomized trials showed the benefits of endovascular therapy. Our goal was toprovide a visual aid tool to guide clinicians in the decision process ofendovascular intervention in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Methods Wecreated visual plots (Cates' plots; www.nntonline.net ) representing benefits of standard of care vs. endovascular thrombectomy from the pooled analysis of fiveRCTs using stent retrievers. These plots represent the following clinicallyrelevant outcomes (1) functionally independent state (modified Rankin scale (mRS)0 to 2 at 90 days) (2) excellent recovery (mRS 0-1) at 90 days, (3) NIHSS 0-2 (4)early neurological recovery, and (5) revascularization at 24 h. Subgroupsvisually represented include time to treatment and baseline stroke severitystrata. Results Overall, 1287 patients (634 assigned to endovascularthrombectomy, 653 assigned to control were included to create the visual plots.Cates' visual plots revealed that for every 100 patients with acute ischemicstroke and large vessel occlusion, 27 would achieve independence at 90 days (mRS 0-2) in the control group compared to 49 (95% CI 43-56) in the interventiongroup. Similarly, 21 patients would achieve early neurological recovery at 24 hcompared to 54 (95% CI 45-63) out of 100 for the intervention group. ConclusionCates' plots may assist clinicians and patients to visualize and comparepotential outcomes after an acute ischemic stroke. Our results suggest that forevery 100 treated individuals with an acute ischemic stroke and a large vesselocclusion, endovascular thrombectomy would provide 22 additional patientsreaching independency at three months and 33 more patients achieving ENR comparedto controls.
 Previous studies have reported that when people self-reflect--they typicallyjudge the self as more positive (or less negative) compared to others on a range of dimensions (such as health, social skills, or achievement). In the presentstudy, we investigated whether viewing the self through the eyes of other people reduces this egocentric (self-centered) bias. Event-related brain potentials(ERPs) were examined in 17 subjects who performed judgments of adjectives inpositive or negative valences from either self-perspective or other-perspective. Reaction times revealed an interaction between the factors perspective andemotional valence. Faster responses occurred after positive words in theself-perspective condition. A similar interaction was observed in the ERPwaveforms in the time range of the N400 component: smaller N400 amplitudes wereelicited by positive stimuli compared to negative stimuli in the self-perspectivecondition, but not in the other-perspective condition. Similarly, a reversedpattern was found in the late positive component (LPC) at 415-815 ms. The presentstudy suggests that shifts in perspectives between self and others can changeself-appraisal, which in turn reduces egocentric biases of the self. On a neural level, this modulation may be associated with an increase in self-monitoringprocesses.
 Relational aggression such as social rejection is common within school peergroups. Converging evidence suggests that adolescent females are particularlysensitive to social rejection. We used a novel fMRI adaptation of the Cyberballsocial rejection paradigm to investigate the neural response to social rejection in 19 mid-adolescent (aged 14-16) and 16 adult female participants. Across allparticipants, social exclusion (relative to inclusion) elicited a response inbilateral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) extending into ventral and subgenualanterior cingulate cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex; and the leftventrolateral PFC (vlPFC); regions that have been associated in previous studies with social evaluation, negative affective processing, and affect regulationrespectively. However, the exclusion-related response in right vlPFC, a regionassociated in previous studies with the regulation of rejection-related distress,was attenuated in adolescents. Within mPFC, greater activation during exclusionvs. inclusion was associated with greater self-reported susceptibility to peerinfluence in adolescents but not in adults. This suggests that the brain'sresponse to experimentally-induced social rejection relates to adolescentbehaviour in real-world social interactions. We speculate about the potentialimplications of these findings for educational settings. In particular,functional development of affective circuitry during adolescence may influencesocial interaction within the school peer group.
 A recent study by Hassabis et al. suggests that the brain constructs 'personalitymodels' of other people. When imagining another individual, multi-voxel patterns of fMRI activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) contained informationabout the individual's unique combination of personality traits. The authorspropose that, in concert with other regions, the mPFC assembles a model ofanother's personality that is ultimately used to predict behavior.
 Numerous studies have shown a 'negativity bias' in emotion processing and effect of menstrual phase on emotion processing. Most of these results, however, did notmatch the arousal of different types of stimuli. The present study examined thetime course of negative emotion processing across different menstrual phases(e.g., late luteal/premenstrual phase and follicular phase) when the arousallevel of negative and neutral stimuli was equal. Following previous studies, anoddball paradigm was utilized in present study. Participants viewed neutral andnegative (highly (HN) and moderately negative (MN)) stimuli with matched arousal and were asked to make deviant vs. standard judgments. The behavioral resultsshowed a higher accuracy for HN stimuli than neutral stimuli, and the othercomparisons were not significant. The major event-related potential (ERP) findingwas that N2 amplitude was larger for MN than neutral in the late luteal phase,whereas such difference was absent during the follicular phase. Moreover, The N2 for HN stimuli was larger in late luteal phase than in follicular phase.Therefore, female may be with higher sensitivity to MN stimuli during late lutealphase than during follicular phase when the arousal of stimuli was wellcontrolled. These results provide additional insight to premenstrual affectivesyndrome and affective disorder.
 Social buffering, the phenomenon by which the presence of a familiar individualreduces or even eliminates stress- and fear-induced responses, exists indifferent animal species and has been examined in the context of themother-infant relationship, in addition to adults. Although it is a well-knowneffect, the biological mechanisms that underlie it as well as its developmentalimpact are not well understood. Here, we provide a review of evidence of socialand maternal buffering of stress reactivity in nonhuman primates, and some datafrom our group suggesting that when the mother-infant relationship is disrupted, maternal buffering is impaired. This evidence underscores the critical role that maternal care plays for proper regulation and development of emotional and stressresponses of primate infants. Disruptions of the parent-infant bond constituteearly adverse experiences associated with increased risk for psychopathology. We will focus on infant maltreatment, a devastating experience not only for humans, but for nonhuman primates as well. Taking advantage of this naturalistic animalmodel of adverse maternal caregiving, we have shown that competent maternal care is critical for the development of healthy attachment, social behavior, andemotional and stress regulation, as well as of the neural circuits underlyingthese functions.
 Conscious thought involves an interpretive inner monologue pertaining to ourwaking experiences. Previous studies focused on the mechanisms that allow us toremember externally presented stimuli, but the neurobiological basis of theability to remember one's internal mentations remains unknown. In order toinvestigate this question, we presented participants with sentences and scannedtheir neural activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as they incidentally produced spontaneous internal mentations. After the scan, wepresented the sentences again and asked participants to describe the specificthoughts they had during the initial presentation of each sentence. Wecategorized experimental trials for each participant according to whether theyresulted in subsequently reported internal mentations or not. The results showthat activation within classic language processing areas was associated withparticipants' ability to recollect their thoughts. Activation within mostly rightlateralized and medial "default-mode network" regions was associated with notreporting such thoughts.
 The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is thought to play a key role in thecognitive control of emotion and has therefore, unsurprisingly, been implicatedin the regulation of physical pain perception. This brain region may alsoinfluence the experience of social pain, which has been shown to activate similarneural networks as seen in response to physical pain. Here, we applied sham oractive low-frequency (1 Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)to the left DLPFC, previously shown to exert bilateral effects in painperception, in healthy participants. Following stimulation, participants playedthe "Cyberball Task"; an online ball-tossing game in which the subjectparticipant is included or excluded. Compared to sham, rTMS did not modulatebehavioural response to social exclusion. However, within the active rTMS grouponly, greater trait personal distress was related to enhanced negative outcomesto social exclusion. These results add further support to the notion that theeffect of brain stimulation is not homogenous across individuals, and indicatesthe need to consider baseline individual differences when assessing response tobrain stimulation. This seems particularly relevant in social neuroscienceinvestigations, where trait factors may have a meaningful effect.
 The goal of the current study was to examine whether differential neuralattentional capture and evaluative responses for out-group homosexual relative toin-group heterosexual targets occur during social categorization. To this end, 36heterosexual participants were presented with pictures of heterosexual andhomosexual couples in a picture-viewing task that was designed to assess implicitlevels of discomfort toward homosexuality and explicit evaluations ofpleasantness toward the images. Neural activity in the form ofelectroencephalogram was recorded during the presentation of the pictures, andevent-related potentials resulting from these stimuli were examined. Participantsalso completed questionnaires that assessed the degree to which they socializedwith gays and lesbians. Results demonstrated that relative to straight couples,larger P2 amplitude was observed in response to gay but not to lesbian couples.However, both gay and lesbian couples yielded a larger late positive potentialthan straight couples. Moreover, the degree to which participants differentially directed early neural attention to out-group lesbian versus in-group straightcouples was related to their familiarity with homosexual individuals. This work, which provides an initial understanding of the neural underpinnings of attention toward homosexual couples, suggests that differences in the processing of sexual orientation can occur as early as 200 ms and may be moderated by familiarity.
 Rapid responses to emotional words play a crucial role in social communication.This study employed event-related potentials to examine the time course of neuraldynamics involved in emotional word processing. Participants performed adual-target task in which positive, negative and neutral adjectives were rapidly presented. The early occipital P1 was found larger when elicited by negativewords, indicating that the first stage of emotional word processing mainlydifferentiates between non-threatening and potentially threatening information.The N170 and the early posterior negativity were larger for positive and negativewords, reflecting the emotional/non-emotional discrimination stage of wordprocessing. The late positive component not only distinguished emotional wordsfrom neutral words, but also differentiated between positive and negative words. This represents the third stage of emotional word processing, the emotionseparation. Present results indicated that, similar with the three-stage model offacial expression processing; the neural processing of emotional words can alsobe divided into three stages. These findings prompt us to believe that the natureof emotion can be analyzed by the brain independent of stimulus type, and thatthe three-stage scheme may be a common model for emotional information processingin the context of limited attentional resources.
 Successful social interactions require both affect sharing (empathy) andunderstanding others' mental states (Theory of Mind, ToM). As these two functionshave mostly been investigated in isolation, the specificity of the underlyingneural networks and the relation of these networks to the respective behavioralindices could not be tested. Here, we present a novel fMRI paradigm (EmpaToM)that independently manipulates both empathy and ToM. Experiments 1a/b (N=90)validated the task with established empathy and ToM paradigms on a behavioral andneural level. Experiment 2 (N=178) employed the EmpaToM and revealed clearlyseparable neural networks including anterior insula for empathy and ventraltemporoparietal junction for ToM. These distinct networks could be replicated in task-free resting state functional connectivity. Importantly, brain activity inthese two networks specifically predicted the respective behavioral indices, thatis, inter-individual differences in ToM related brain activity predictedinter-individual differences in ToM performance, but not empathic responding, andvice versa. Taken together, the validated EmpaToM allows separation of affective and cognitive routes to understanding others. It may thus benefit futureclinical, developmental, and intervention studies on identifying selectiveimpairments and improvement in specific components of social cognition.
 Cognitive emotion regulation (CER) is a critical human ability to face aversiveemotional stimuli in a flexible way, via recruitment of specific prefrontal braincircuits. Animal research reveals a central role of ventral striatum in emotionalbehavior, for both aversive conditioning, with striatum signaling aversiveprediction errors (aPE), and for integrating competing influences of distinctstriatal inputs from regions such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala,hippocampus and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Translating these ventral striatal findings from animal research to human CER, we hypothesized that successful CERwould affect the balance of competing influences of striatal afferents onstriatal aPE signals, in a way favoring PFC as opposed to 'subcortical' (i.e.,non-isocortical) striatal inputs. Using aversive Pavlovian conditioning with and without CER during fMRI, we found that during CER, superior regulators indeedreduced the modulatory impact of 'subcortical' striatal afferents (hippocampus,amygdala and VTA) on ventral striatal aPE signals, while keeping the PFC impactintact. In contrast, inferior regulators showed an opposite pattern. Our results demonstrate that ventral striatal aPE signals and associated competing modulatoryinputs are critical mechanisms underlying successful cognitive regulation ofaversive emotions in humans.
 Empathy--the ability to share the feelings of others--is fundamental to ouremotional and social lives. Previous human imaging studies focusing on empathyfor others' pain have consistently shown activations in regions also involved in the direct pain experience, particularly anterior insula and anterior andmidcingulate cortex. These findings suggest that empathy is, in part, based onshared representations for firsthand and vicarious experiences of affectivestates. Empathic responses are not static but can be modulated by personcharacteristics, such as degree of alexithymia. It has also been shown thatcontextual appraisal, including perceived fairness or group membership of others,may modulate empathic neuronal activations. Empathy often involves coactivations in further networks associated with social cognition, depending on the specificsituation and information available in the environment. Empathy-related insularand cingulate activity may reflect domain-general computations representing andpredicting feeling states in self and others, likely guiding adaptive homeostaticresponses and goal-directed behavior in dynamic social contexts.
 In the study of consciousness, neurophenomenology was originally established as anovel research program attempting to reconcile two apparently irreconcilablemethodologies in psychology: qualitative and quantitative methods. Its potential relies on Francisco Varela's idea of reciprocal constraints, in whichfirst-person accounts and neurophysiological data mutually inform each other.However, since its first conceptualization, neurophenomenology has encounteredmethodological problems. These problems have emerged mainly because of thedifficulty of obtaining and analyzing subjective reports in a systematic manner. However, more recently, several interview techniques for describing subjectiveaccounts have been developed, collectively known as "second-person methods."Second-person methods refer to interview techniques that solicit both verbal and non-verbal information from participants in order to obtain systematic anddetailed subjective reports. Here, we examine the potential for employingsecond-person methodologies in the neurophenomenological study of consciousnessand we propose three practical ideas for developing a second-personneurophenomenological method. Thus, we first describe second-person methodologiesavailable in the literature for analyzing subjective reports, identifyingspecific constraints on the status of the first-, second- and third- personmethods. Second, we analyze two experimental studies that explicitly incorporate second-person methods for traversing the "gap" between phenomenology andneuroscience. Third, we analyze the challenges that second-person accounts facein establishing an objective methodology for comparing results across differentparticipants and interviewers: this is the "validation" problem. Finally, wesynthesize the common aspects of the interview methods described above. Inconclusion, our arguments emphasize that second-person methods represent apowerful approach for closing the gap between the experiential and theneurobiological levels of description in the study of human consciousness.
 Although goal pursuit is related to both functioning of the brain's rewardcircuits and psychological factors, the literatures surrounding these conceptshave often been separate. Here, we use the psychological construct of regulatory focus to investigate individual differences in neural response to reward.Regulatory focus theory proposes two motivational orientations for personal goal pursuit: (1) promotion, associated with sensitivity to potential gain, and (2)prevention, associated with sensitivity to potential loss. The monetary incentivedelay task was used to manipulate reward circuit function, along withinstructional framing corresponding to promotion and prevention in awithin-subject design. We observed that the more promotion oriented an individualwas, the lower their ventral striatum response to gain cues. Follow-up analysesrevealed that greater promotion orientation was associated with decreased ventralstriatum response even to no-value cues, suggesting that promotion orientationmay be associated with relatively hypoactive reward system function. The findingsare also likely to represent an interaction between the cognitive andmotivational characteristics of the promotion system with the task demands.Prevention orientation did not correlate with ventral striatum response to gaincues, supporting the discriminant validity of regulatory focus theory. Theresults highlight a dynamic association between individual differences inself-regulation and reward system function.
 In a previous study, with adults, we demonstrated that the amygdala and anterior cingulate gyrus are differentially responsive to happy and sad faces presentedsubliminally. Because the ability to perceive subtle facial signals communicatingsadness is an important aspect of prosocial development, and is critical forempathic behavior, we examined this phenomenon from a developmental perspectiveusing a backward masking paradigm. While undergoing functional magnetic resonanceimaging (fMRI), 10 healthy adolescent children were presented with a series ofhappy and sad facial expressions, each lasting 20 ms and masked immediately by a neutral face to prevent conscious awareness of the affective expression. Relativeto fixation baseline, masked sad faces activated the right amygdala, whereasmasked happy faces failed to activate any of the regions of interest. Directcomparison between masked happy and sad faces revealed valence specificdifferences in the anterior cingulate gyrus. When the data were comparedstatistically to our previous sample of adults, the adolescent group showedsignificantly greater activity in the right amygdala relative to the adultsduring the masked sad condition. Groups also differed in several non-hypothesizedregions. Development of unconscious perception from adolescence into adulthoodappears to be accompanied by reduced activity within limbic affect processingsystems, and perhaps increased involvement of other cortical and cerebellarsystems.
 With the mapping of macroscale connectomes by means of in vivo diffusion-weightedMR Imaging (DWI) rapidly gaining in popularity, one of the necessary steps is theexamination of metrics of connectivity strength derived from thesereconstructions. In the field of human macroconnectomics the number ofreconstructed fiber streamlines (NOS) is more and more used as a metric ofcortico-cortical interareal connectivity strength, but the link between DWI NOSand in vivo animal tract-tracing measurements of anatomical connectivity strengthremains poorly understood. In this technical report, we communicate on acomparison between DWI derived metrics and tract-tracing metrics of projectionstrength. Tract-tracing information on projection strength of interareal pathwayswas extracted from two commonly used macaque connectome datasets, including (1)the CoCoMac database of collated tract-tracing experiments of the macaque brainand (2) the high-resolution tract-tracing dataset of Markov and Kennedy andcoworkers. NOS and density of reconstructed fiber pathways derived from DWI data acquired across 10 rhesus macaques was found to positively correlate totract-tracing based measurements of connectivity strength across both the CoCoMacand Markov dataset (both P < 0.001), suggesting DWI NOS to form a valid method ofassessment of the projection strength of white matter pathways. Our findingsprovide confidence of in vivo DWI connectome reconstructions to represent fairly realistic estimates of the wiring strength of white matter projections. Ourcross-modal comparison supports the notion of in vivo DWI to be a validmethodology for robust description and interpretation of brain wiring.
 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The review presents a selection of recent studies in the fieldof vestibular neuroscience, including how vestibular stimulation modulates space and body perception. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent neuroimaging studies identified the operculo-insular/retroinsular cortex as the core vestibular cortex and showed howit is reorganized after vestibular dysfunctions. Subliminal galvanic vestibularstimulation (GVS) induces long-term reduction of hemispatial neglect and improvesvertical perception in stroke patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain tobe identified. Healthy volunteer research suggests that GVS and caloricvestibular stimulation (CVS) modulate visual and somatosensory processing andthat beneficial effects of GVS/CVS in stroke patients are not limited to merelyrebalancing brain hemispheric activity. Another mechanism would be that GVS/CVSanchors the self to the body, thus promoting an egocentric frame of reference.SUMMARY: In addition to 'balancing the body', the vestibular cortical networkcontributes to modulate space, body and self-awareness. Emerging evidencesuggests that the vestibular network expands into dimensions of emotionprocessing, mental health, and social cognition. Here, the importance ofconnecting vestibular physiology, affective neuroscience, and social neuroscienceto better understand the psychological aspects of vertigo in otoneurology isdiscussed.
 Group-focused moral foundations (GMFs) - moral values that help protect thegroup's welfare - sharply divide conservatives from liberals and religiouslydevout from non-believers. However, there is little evidence about what drivesthis divide. Moral foundations theory and the model of motivated social cognitionboth associate group-focused moral foundations with differences in conflictdetection and resolution capacity, but in opposing directions. Individualdifferences in conflict detection and resolution implicate specificneuroanatomical differences. Examining neuroanatomy thus affords an objective andnon-biased opportunity to contrast these influential theories. Here, we reportthat increased adherence to group-focused moral foundations was stronglyassociated (whole-brain corrected) with reduced gray matter volume in key regionsof the conflict detection and resolution system (anterior cingulate cortex andlateral prefrontal cortex). Because reduced gray matter is reliably associatedwith reduced neural and cognitive capacity, these findings support the ideaoutlined in the model of motivated social cognition that belief in group-focused moral values is associated with reduced conflict detection and resolutioncapacity.
 In the current commentary, we discuss Stoltenberg and colleagues' finding(reported in this issue) that variation in the serotonin transporter gene(5-HTTLPR) is associated with prosocial behavior via effects on anxiety in socialsituations. We note how their results are consistent with evidence from thepsychopharmacological literature and illustrate how a mediational framework caninform understanding of genetic and psychological associations, and we suggestthat future studies that manipulate social context could further elucidate therelationship between genes involved in serotonin regulation and prosocialbehavior.
 BACKGROUND: The management of multiple sclerosis (MS) is rapidly changing by the introduction of new and more effective disease-modifying agents. The importanceof risk stratification was confirmed by results on disease progression predicted by different risk score systems. Despite these advances, we know very littleabout medical decisions under uncertainty in the management of MS. The goal ofthis study is to i) identify whether overconfidence, tolerance torisk/uncertainty, herding influence medical decisions, and ii) to evaluate thefrequency of therapeutic inertia (defined as lack of treatment initiation orintensification in patients not at goals of care) and its predisposing factors inthe management of MS. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a prospective study comprising acombination of case-vignettes and surveys and experiments fromNeuroeconomics/behavioral economics to identify cognitive distortions associated with medical decisions and therapeutic inertia. Participants include MS fellowsand MS experts from across Spain. Each participant will receive an individuallink using Qualtrics platform((c)) that includes 20 case-vignettes, 3 surveys,and 4 behavioral experiments. The total time for completing the study isapproximately 30-35 min. Case vignettes were selected to be representative ofcommon clinical encounters in MS practice. Surveys and experiments includestandardized test to measure overconfidence, aversion to risk and ambiguity,herding (following colleague's suggestions even when not supported by theevidence), physicians' reactions to uncertainty, and questions from theSocio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) related to risk preferences in differentdomains. By applying three different MS score criteria (modified Rio, EMA,Prosperini's scheme) we take into account physicians' differences in escalatingtherapy when evaluating medical decisions across case-vignettes. CONCLUSIONS: Thepresent study applies an innovative approach by combining tools to assess medicaldecisions with experiments from Neuroeconomics that applies to common scenariosin MS care. Our results will help advance the field by providing a betterunderstanding on the influence of cognitive factors (e.g., overconfidence,aversion to risk and uncertainty, herding) on medical decisions and therapeuticinertia in the management of MS which could lead to better outcomes.
 The evolution of neurocranial morphology in Homo sapiens is characterized bybulging of the parietal region, a feature unique to our species. In modernhumans, expansion of the parietal surface occurs during the first year of life,in a morphogenetic stage which is absent in chimpanzees and Neandertals. Asimilar variation in brain shape among living adult humans is associated withexpansion of the precuneus. Using MRI-derived structural brain templates, wecompare medial brain morphology between humans and chimpanzees through shapeanalysis and geometrical modeling. We find that the main spatial difference is a prominent expansion of the precuneus in our species, providing further evidenceof evolutionary changes associated with this area. The precuneus is a major hubof brain organization, a central node of the default-mode network, and plays anessential role in visuospatial integration. Together, the comparativeneuroanatomical and paleontological evidence suggest that precuneus expansion is a neurological specialization of H. sapiens that evolved in the last 150,000years that may be associated with recent human cognitive specializations.
 Navigating the social world requires the ability to maintain and manipulateinformation about people's beliefs, traits, and mental states. We characterizethis capacity as social working memory (SWM). To date, very little research hasexplored this phenomenon, in part because of the assumption that general working memory systems would support working memory for social information. Various linesof research, however, suggest that social cognitive processing relies on aneurocognitive network (i.e., the "mentalizing network") that is functionallydistinct from, and considered antagonistic with, the canonical working memorynetwork. Here, we review evidence suggesting that demanding social cognitionrequires SWM and that both the mentalizing and canonical working memoryneurocognitive networks support SWM. The neural data run counter to the commonfinding of parametric decreases in mentalizing regions as a function of workingmemory demand and suggest that the mentalizing network can support demandingcognition, when it is demanding social cognition. Implications for individualdifferences in social cognition and pathologies of social cognition arediscussed.
 Recent work has highlighted that the generation of thoughts unrelated to thecurrent environment may be both a cause and a consequence of unhappiness. Thecurrent study used lag analysis to examine whether the relationship betweenself-generated thought and negative affect depends on the content of the thoughtsthemselves. We found that the emotional content could strongly predict subsequentmood (e.g. negative thoughts were associated with subsequent negative mood).However, this direct relationship was modulated by the socio-temporal content of the thoughts: thoughts that were past- and other-related were associated withsubsequent negative mood, even if current thought content was positive. Bycontrast, future- and self-related thoughts preceded improvements of mood, evenwhen current thought content was negative. These results highlight the important link between self-generated thought and mood and suggest that the socio-temporal content plays an important role in determining whether an individual's futureaffective state will be happy or sad.
 Preventive interventions focus on reducing risk and promoting protective factors in the child as well as their cultural ecologies (family, classroom, school, peergroups, neighborhood, etc). By improving competencies in both the child and theircontexts many of these interventions promote resilience. Although there are now asubstantial number of preventive interventions that reduce problem behaviors and build competencies across childhood and adolescence, there has been littleintegration with recent findings in neuropsychology and neuroscience. Thisarticle focuses on the integration of prevention research and neuroscience in thecontext of interventions that promote resilience by improving the executivefunctions (EF); inhibitory control, planning, and problem solving skills,emotional regulation, and attentional capacities of children and youth.Illustrations are drawn from recent randomized controlled trials of the PromotingAlternative Thinking Strategies (PATHS) curriculum. The discussion focuses on thenext steps in transdisciplinary research in prevention and social neuroscience.
 Pain features centrally in numerous illnesses and generates enormous publichealth costs. Despite its ubiquity, the psychological and neurophysiologicalnature of pain remains controversial. Here, we survey one controversy inparticular: the relation between nociceptive pain, which is somatic in origin,and empathic pain, which arises from observing others in pain. First, we reviewevidence for neural overlap between nociceptive and empathic pain and what thisoverlap implies about underlying mental representations. Then, we propose aframework for understanding the nature of the psychological andneurophysiological correspondence across these types of 'pain'. This frameworksuggests new directions for research that can better identify shared anddissociable representations underlying different types of distress, and caninform theories about the nature of pain.
 Nonverbal behavior expresses many of the dynamics underlying face-to-face social interactions, implicitly revealing one's attitudes, emotions, and social motives.Although research has often described nonverbal behavior as approach versusavoidant (i.e., through the study of proxemics), psychological responses to many social contexts are a mix of these two. Fairness violations are an ideal example,eliciting strong avoidance-related responses such as negative attitudes, as well as strong approach-related responses such as anger and retaliation. As such,nonverbal behavior toward unfair others is difficult to predict in discreteapproach versus avoidance terms. Here we address this problem using proxemicimaging, a new method which creates frequency images of dyadic space by combiningmotion capture data of interpersonal distance and gaze to provide an objectivebut nuanced analysis of social interactions. Participants first played aneconomic game with fair and unfair players and then encountered them in anunrelated task in a virtual environment. Afterwards, they could monetarily punishthe other players. Proxemic images of the interactions demonstrate that, overall,participants kept the fair player closer. However, participants who activelypunished the unfair players were more likely to stand directly in front of those players and even to turn their backs on them. Together these patterns illustrate that fairness violations influence nonverbal behavior in ways that furtherpredict differences in more overt behavior (i.e., financial punishment).Moreover, they demonstrate that proxemic imaging can detect subtle combinationsof approach and avoidance behavior during face-to-face social interactions.
 Humans altruistically punish violators of social norms to enforce cooperation andpro-social behaviors. However, such altruistic behaviors diminish when others arepresent, due to a diffusion of responsibility. We investigated the neuralsignatures underlying the modulations of diffusion of responsibility onaltruistic punishment, conjoining a third-party punishment task withevent-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivariate Grangercausality mapping. In our study, participants acted as impartial third-partydecision-makers and decided how to punish norm violations under two differentsocial contexts: alone (i.e., full responsibility) or in the presence of putativeother third-party decision makers (i.e., diffused responsibility). Our behavioralresults demonstrated that the diffusion of responsibility served as a mediator ofcontext-dependent punishment. In the presence of putative others, participantswho felt less responsible also punished less severely in response to normviolations. Our neural results revealed that underlying this behavioral effectwas a network of interconnected brain regions. For unfair relative to fairsplits, the presence of others led to attenuated responses in brain regionsimplicated in signaling norm violations (e.g., AI) and to increased responses in brain regions implicated in calculating values of norm violations (e.g., vmPFC,precuneus) and mentalizing about others (dmPFC). The dmPFC acted as the driver ofthe punishment network, modulating target regions, such as AI, vmPFC, andprecuneus, to adjust altruistic punishment behavior. Our results uncovered theneural basis of the influence of diffusion of responsibility on altruisticpunishment and highlighted the role of the mentalizing network in this important phenomenon.

 Animal models and behavioral paradigms are critical for elucidating the neuralmechanism involved in complex behaviors, including social cognition. Bothgenotype and phenotype based models have implicated the neuropeptide oxytocin(OT) in the regulation of social behavior. Based on the findings in animalmodels, alteration of the OT system has been hypothesized to play a role in thesocial deficits associated with autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders.While the evidence linking the peptide to the etiology of the disorder is not yetconclusive, evidence from multiple animal models suggest modulation of the OTsystem may be a viable strategy for the pharmacological treatment of socialdeficits. In this review, we will discuss how animal models have been utilized tounderstand the role of OT in social cognition and how those findings can beapplied to the conceptualization and treatment of the social impairments in ASD. Animal models with genetic alterations of the OT system, like the OT, OT receptorand CD38 knock-out mice, and those with phenotypic variation in social behavior, like BTBR inbred mice and prairie voles, coupled with behavioral paradigms withface and construct validity may prove to have predictive validity for identifyingthe most efficacious methods of stimulating the OT system to enhance socialcognition in humans. The widespread use of strong animal models of socialcognition has the potential yield pharmacological, interventions for thetreatment social impairments psychiatric disorders. This article is part of aSpecial Issue entitled Oxytocin, Vasopressin, and Social Behavior.
 Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying human neuropsychiatricdisorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), has been hindered by the lack of a robust, translational animal model. Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) display many of the same social behaviors that are affected in ASD, making them anexcellent animal species in which to model social impairments. However, thesocial impairments associated with ASD may reflect extreme ends of a continuousdistribution of traits. Thus, to validate the rhesus monkey as an animal modelfor studying social impairments that has strong translational relevance for ASD, researchers need an easily-implemented measurement tool that can quantifyvariation in social behavior dimensionally. The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)is a 65-item survey that identifies both typical and atypical social behaviors inhumans that covary with ASD symptom severity. A chimpanzee SRS has already beenvalidated and the current study adapted this tool for use in the rhesus monkey(mSRS). Fifteen raters completed the mSRS for 105 rhesus monkeys living at theYerkes National Primate Research Center. The mSRS scores showed a unimodaldistribution with a positive skew that identified 6 statistical outliers.Inter-rater reliability was very strong, but only 17 of the 36 questions showedpositive intra-item reliability. The results of an exploratory factor analysisidentified 3 factors that explained over 60% of the variance, with 12 itemssignificantly loading onto the primary factor. These items reflected behaviorsassociated with social avoidance, social anxiety or inflexibility and socialconfidence. These initial findings are encouraging and suggest that variabilityin the social responsiveness of rhesus monkeys can be quantified using the mSRS: a tool that has strong translational relevance for human disorders. With further modification, the mSRS may provide an promising new direction for research on thebiological mechanisms underlying social impairments.
 The relationship between autistic traits and gaze-oriented attention to fearfuland happy faces was investigated at the behavioral and neuronal levels. Uprightand inverted dynamic face stimuli were used in a gaze-cueing paradigm while eventrelated potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Participants responded faster togazed-at than to non-gazed-at targets, and this gaze orienting effect (GOE)diminished with inversion, suggesting it relies on facial configuration. It wasalso larger for fearful than happy faces but only in participants with highautism-spectrum quotient (AQ) scores. While the GOE to fearful faces was ofsimilar magnitude regardless of AQ scores, a diminished GOE to happy faces wasfound in participants with high AQ scores. At the ERP level, a congruency effect on target-elicited P1 component reflected enhanced visual processing of gazed-at targets. In addition, cue-triggered early directing attention negativity andanterior directing attention negativity reflected, respectively, attentionorienting and attention holding at gazed-at locations. These neural markers ofspatial attention orienting were not modulated by emotion and were not found inparticipants with high AQ scores. Together, these findings suggest that autistic traits influence attention orienting to gaze and its modulation by socialemotions such as happiness.
 Watching or imagining other people experiencing pain activates the centralnervous system's pain matrix in the observer. Without emotion regulation skills, repeated exposure to the suffering of others in healthcare professionals may beassociated with the adverse consequences of personal distress, burnout andcompassion fatigue, which are detrimental to their wellbeing. Here, we recordedevent-related potentials (ERP) from physicians and matched controls as they were presented with visual stimuli depicting body parts pricked by a needle (pain) or touched by a Q-tip (no-pain). The results showed early N110 differentiationbetween pain and no-pain over the frontal area as well as late P3 over thecentro-parietal regions were observed in the control participants. In contrast,no such early and late ERP responses were detected in the physicians. Our resultsindicate that emotion regulation in physicians has very early effects, inhibitingthe bottom-up processing of the perception of pain in others. It is suggestedthat physicians' down-regulation of the pain response dampens their negativearousal in response to the pain of others and thus may have many beneficialconsequences including freeing up cognitive resources necessary for being ofassistance.
 Previous research has examined neural responses to threatening facial expressionssuch as those displaying anger, fear, and disgust. Here, we examined neuralresponses to a different type of threatening facial expression that primarilysignifies a threat to social connection, namely a "disapproving" facialexpression. We hypothesized that neural responses to disapproving facialexpressions would be moderated by individual differences in rejectionsensitivity. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we scannedparticipants while they viewed brief video clips of facial expressions depicting disapproval, anger, and disgust. As expected, all three expressions yieldedbilateral amygdala activation relative to a resting baseline. Additionally,individuals who scored higher on a measure of rejection sensitivity exhibitedgreater dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activity in response to disapprovingfacial expressions, but not in response to anger or disgust facial expressions.Results suggest that, at the neural level, individuals high in rejectionsensitivity may be more sensitive to facial expressions signaling potentialrejection, but not to threatening facial expressions in general. Results alsosuggest that disapproving facial expressions convey a distinct type of threat andshould be considered in future studies of socially threatening facialexpressions.
 In the past decade, a flurry of empirical and theoretical research on moralityand empathy has taken place, and interest and usage in the media and the publicarena have increased. At times, in both popular culture and academia, moralityand empathy are used interchangeably, and quite often the latter is considered toplay a foundational role for the former. In this article, we argue that although there is a relationship between morality and empathy, it is not asstraightforward as apparent at first glance. Moreover, it is critical todistinguish among the different facets of empathy (emotional sharing, empathicconcern, and perspective taking), as each uniquely influences moral cognition andpredicts differential outcomes in moral behavior. Empirical evidence and theoriesfrom evolutionary biology as well as developmental, behavioral, and affective andsocial neuroscience are comprehensively integrated in support of this argument.The wealth of findings illustrates a complex and equivocal relationship betweenmorality and empathy. The key to understanding such relations is to be moreprecise on the concepts being used and, perhaps, abandoning the muddy concept of empathy.
 Many powerful human emotional thoughts are generated in the absence of aprecipitating event in the environment. Here, we tested whether we can decode thevalence of internally driven, self-generated thoughts during task-free rest basedon neural similarities with task-related affective mental states. We acquiredfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while participants generatedpositive and negative thoughts as part of an attribution task (Session A) andwhile they reported the occurrence of comparable mental states during task-freerest periods (Session B). With the use of multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA),we identified response patterns in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) thatencode the affective content of thoughts that are generated in response to anexternal experimental cue. Importantly, these task driven response patternsreliably predicted the occurrence of affective thoughts generated duringunconstrained rest periods recorded one week apart. This demonstrates that atleast certain elements of task-cued and task-free affective experiences rely on acommon neural code. Furthermore, our findings reveal the role that the mOFC playsin determining the affective tone of unconstrained thoughts. More generally, our results suggest that MVPA is an important methodological tool for attempts tounderstand unguided subject driven mental states such as mind-wandering anddaydreaming based on neural similarities with task-based experiences.
 Emotional stimuli can be processed without consciousness. In the current study,we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to assess whether perceptual loadinfluences non-conscious processing of fearful facial expressions. Perceptualload was manipulated using a letter search task with the target letter presented at the fixation point, while facial expressions were presented peripherally andmasked to prevent conscious awareness. The letter string comprised six letters (Xor N) that were identical (low load) or different (high load). Participants were instructed to discriminate the letters at fixation or the facial expression(fearful or neutral) in the periphery. Participants were faster and more accurateat detecting letters in the low load condition than in the high load condition.Fearful faces elicited a sustained positivity from 250 ms to 700 ms post-stimulusover fronto-central areas during the face discrimination and low-load letterdiscrimination conditions, but this effect was completely eliminated duringhigh-load letter discrimination. Our findings imply that non-conscious processingof fearful faces depends on perceptual load, and attentional resources arenecessary for non-conscious processing.
 In social environments, choosing between multiple rewards is modulated by theuncertainty of the situation. Here, we compared how mice interact with aconspecific and how they use acoustic communication during this interaction in a three chambers task (no social threat was possible) and a Social InteractionTask, SIT (uncertain situation as two mice interact freely). We furthermanipulated the motivational state of the mice to see how they rank naturalrewards such as social contact, food, and novelty seeking. We previously showedthat beta2-subunit containing nicotinic receptors-beta2(*)nAChRs- are requiredfor establishing reward ranking between social interaction, novelty exploration, and food consumption in social situations with high uncertainty. Knockout micefor beta2(*)nAChRs-beta2(-/-)mice- exhibit profound impairment in making socialflexible choices, as compared to control -WT- mice. Our current data shows thatbeing confronted with a conspecific in a socially safe environment as compared toa more uncertain environment, drastically reduced communication between the twomice, and changed their way to deal with a social conspecific. Furthermore, wedemonstrated for the first time, that beta2(-/-) mice had the same motivationalranking than WT mice when placed in a socially safe environment. Therefore,beta2(*)nAChRs are not necessary for integrating social information or socialrewards per se, but are important for making choices, only in a sociallyuncertain environment. This seems particularly important in the context of SocialNeuroscience, as numerous animal models are used to provide novel insights and totest promising novel treatments of human pathologies affecting social andcommunication processes, among which Autistic spectrum disorders andschizophrenia.
 Although shyness is presumed to be related to an increased sensitivity to detect motivationally salient social stimuli, we know little of how shyness affects the early perception of facial emotions. We demonstrate here that individualdifferences in normative shyness were related to brain responses to someemotional faces as early as the P1 electrocortical component, 80-130 ms afterstimulus onset. High-shy individuals showed reduced P1 amplitude for fearfulfaces compared to neutral faces. Low-shy individuals processed happy faces fasterthan other emotions and showed increased P1 amplitudes for happy faces overneutral faces. Regardless of shyness level, participants showed increasedamplitudes in the N170 component (130-200 ms) for all emotions over neutralconditions, particularly for the emotion of fear. This study presents the firstevidence that shyness is related to early electrocortical responses to theprocessing of fearful faces, consistent with a fast-path amygdala sensitivitymodel.
 Visual navigation in familiar and unfamiliar surroundings is an essentialingredient of adaptive daily life behavior. Recent brain imaging work helps torecognize that establishing connectivity between brain regions is of importancefor successful navigation. Here, we ask whether the ability to navigate isimpaired in adolescents who were born premature and suffer congenital bilateralperiventricular brain damage that might affect the pathways interconnectingsubcortical structures with cortex. Performance on a set of visual labyrinthtasks was significantly worse in patients with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL)as compared with premature-born controls without lesions and term-bornadolescents. The ability for visual navigation inversely relates to the severity of motor disability, leg-dominated bilateral spastic cerebral palsy. This agrees with the view that navigation ability substantially improves with practice andmight be compromised in individuals with restrictions in active spatialexploration. Visual navigation is negatively linked to the volumetric extent oflesions over the right parietal and frontal periventricular regions. Whereasimpairments of visual processing of point-light biological motion are associated in patients with PVL with bilateral parietal periventricular lesions, navigation ability is specifically linked to the frontal lesions in the right hemisphere. Wesuggest that more anterior periventricular lesions impair the interrelationsbetween the right hippocampus and cortical areas leading to disintegration ofneural networks engaged in visual navigation. For the first time, we show thatthe severity of right frontal periventricular damage and leg-dominated motordisorders can serve as independent predictors of the visual navigationdisability.
 Neurobiological studies on facial affect recognition have demonstrated reducedresponse amplitudes to anger cues in patients suffering from attention deficithyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is still unclear whether a similar deficitexists in the auditory domain. Therefore, this near-infrared spectroscopy studyfocused on neuronal correlates of affective prosody processing. Fourteen boyssuffering from ADHD and fourteen healthy boys were exposed to emotionallyintoned, standardized sentences of the categories anger, sadness, happiness, and to affectively neutral sentences. Relative to controls, the patients displayed a diminished activation of the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) when processing anger prosody, which was correlated with aggressive behavior. There were no groupdifferences for the other emotions. Additionally, the ADHD group showed increasedsupramarginal gyrus (SMG) activation in the anger condition. This might mirrorcompensatory attention allocation. In summary, we identified a selectivelylowered STG activation to auditory anger cues in ADHD patients. Consequently, STGrecruitment during anger exposure might be used for evaluation of psychotherapyeffects.
 Previous behavioral work suggests that processing information in relation to the self enhances subsequent item recognition. Neuroimaging evidence further suggeststhat regions along the cortical midline, particularly those of the medialprefrontal cortex (PFC), underlie this benefit. There has been little work todate, however, on the effects of self-referential encoding on source memoryaccuracy or whether the medial PFC might contribute to source memory forself-referenced materials. In the current study, we used fMRI to measure neuralactivity while participants studied and subsequently retrieved pictures of commonobjects superimposed on one of two background scenes (sources) under eitherself-reference or self-external encoding instructions. Both item recognition and source recognition were better for objects encoded self-referentially thanself-externally. Neural activity predictive of source accuracy was observed inthe medial PFC (Brodmann area 10) at the time of study for self-referentially butnot self-externally encoded objects. The results of this experiment suggest that processing information in relation to the self leads to a mnemonic benefit forsource level features, and that activity in the medial PFC contributes to thissource memory benefit. This evidence expands the purported role that the medialPFC plays in self-referencing.
 BACKGROUND: If we initiate a sound by our own motor behavior, the N1 component ofthe auditory event-related brain potential (ERP) that the sound elicits isattenuated compared to the N1 elicited by the same sound when it is initiatedexternally. It has been suggested that this N1 suppression results from aninternal predictive mechanism that is in the service of discriminating thesensory consequences of one's own actions from other sensory input. As theN1-suppression effect is becoming a popular approach to investigate predictiveprocessing in cognitive and social neuroscience, it is important to exclude analternative interpretation not related to prediction. According to theattentional account, the N1 suppression is due to a difference in the allocation of attention between self- and externally-initiated sounds. To test thishypothesis, we manipulated the allocation of attention to the sounds in differentblocks: Attention was directed either to the sounds, to the own motor acts or to visual stimuli. If attention causes the N1-suppression effect, then manipulating attention should affect the effect for self-initiated sounds. RESULTS: We foundN1 suppression in all conditions. The N1 per se was affected by attention, butthere was no interaction between attention and self-initiation effects. Thisimplies that self-initiation N1 effects are not caused by attention. CONCLUSIONS:The present results support the assumption that the N1-suppression effect forself-initiated sounds indicates the operation of an internal predictivemechanism. Furthermore, while attention had an influence on the N1a, N1b, and N1ccomponents, the N1-suppression effect was confined to the N1b and N1csubcomponents suggesting that the major contribution to the auditoryN1-suppression effect is circumscribed to late N1 components.
 The ability to suppress unwanted emotional memories is crucial for human mentalhealth. Through consolidation over time, emotional memories often becomeresistant to change. However, how consolidation impacts the effectiveness ofemotional memory suppression is still unknown. Using event-related fMRI whileconcurrently recording skin conductance, we investigated the neurobiologicalprocesses underlying the suppression of aversive memories before and afterovernight consolidation. Here we report that consolidated aversive memoriesretain their emotional reactivity and become more resistant to suppression.Suppression of consolidated memories involves higher prefrontal engagement, andless concomitant hippocampal and amygdala disengagement. In parallel, we show ashift away from hippocampal-dependent representational patterns to distributedneocortical representational patterns in the suppression of aversive memoriesafter consolidation. These findings demonstrate rapid changes in emotional memoryorganization with overnight consolidation, and suggest possible neurobiologicalbases underlying the resistance to suppression of emotional memories in affectivedisorders.
 Social groups across species rapidly self-organize into hierarchies, wheremembers vary in their level of power, influence, skill, or dominance. In thisreview, we explore the nature of social hierarchies and the traits associatedwith status in both humans and nonhuman primates, and how status varies acrossdevelopment in humans. Our review finds that we can rapidly identify socialstatus based on a wide range of cues. Like monkeys, we tend to use certain cues, like physical strength, to make status judgments, although layered on top ofthese more primitive perceptual cues are sociocultural status cues like jobtitles and educational attainment. One's relative status has profound effects on attention, memory, and social interactions, as well as health and wellness. Theseeffects can be particularly pernicious in children and adolescents. Developmentalresearch on peer groups and social exclusion suggests teenagers may beparticularly sensitive to social status information, but research focusedspecifically on status processing and associated brain areas is very limited.Recent evidence from neuroscience suggests that there may be an underlying neuralnetwork, including regions involved in executive, emotional, and rewardprocessing, that is sensitive to status information. We conclude with questionsfor future research as well as stressing the need to expand social neuroscienceresearch on status processing to adolescents.
 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The experience of ourselves as an embodied agent with afirst-person perspective is referred to as 'bodily self'. We present a selective overview of relevant clinical and experimental studies. RECENT FINDINGS: Sharing multisensory body space with others can be observed in patients with structurallyaltered bodies (amputations, congenital absence of limbs), with alteredfunctionality after hemiplegia, such as denial of limb ownership(somatoparaphrenia) and with alterations in bodily self-consciousness on thelevel of the entire body (e.g. in autoscopic phenomena). In healthy participants,the mechanisms underpinning body ownership and observer perspective areempirically investigated by multisensory stimulation paradigms to alter thebodily self. The resulting illusions have promoted the understanding of complexdisturbances of the bodily self, such as out-of-body experiences. We discuss the role of interoception in differentiating between self and others and reviewcurrent advances in the study of body integrity identity disorder, a conditionshaped as much by neurological as by social-psychological factors. SUMMARY: Weadvocate a social neuroscience approach to the bodily self that takes intoaccount the interactions between body, mind and society and might help close the divide between neurology and psychiatry.
 Understanding thoughts with no perceptual basis is a complex problem, and thecommentary by Franklin, Mrazek, Broadway, and Schooler (2013) highlighted some ofthe difficulties that can occur when theorizing about this topic. They arguedthat the suppression of external input during internal thought arises from theselection of internal information. However, once a process of competition hasbeen resolved in favor of self-generated content, it is still necessary toexplain the stability of that content over time. It is proposed that perceptualdecoupling and the associated attenuation of external input make environmentalinformation less likely to gain access to limited resources explaining howinternal thoughts persist over time. Franklin and colleagues also claimed thatperceptual decoupling is unnecessary for an internal train of thought becausestatements of necessity cannot be drawn from correlational evidence. However,experimentally induced internal trains of thought also compete with concurrentexternal information, and this mutual inhibition is easily explained by assuming perceptual decoupling is necessary for the integrity of a detailed internal trainof thought. I argue that the fundamental advantage of the process-occurrenceframework is to highlight that self-generated thought is an emergent propertyfrom a general-purpose cognitive architecture and that models such as these will deepen our understanding more effectively than those focused on describingspecific mental states.
 Attending where others gaze is one of the most fundamental mechanisms of socialcognition. The present study is the first to examine the impact of theattribution of mind to others on gaze-guided attentional orienting and its ERPcorrelates. Using a paradigm in which attention was guided to a location by thegaze of a centrally presented face, we manipulated participants' beliefs aboutthe gazer: gaze behavior was believed to result either from operations of a mind or from a machine. In Experiment 1, beliefs were manipulated by cue identity(human or robot), while in Experiment 2, cue identity (robot) remained identical across conditions and beliefs were manipulated solely via instruction, which was irrelevant to the task. ERP results and behavior showed that participants'attention was guided by gaze only when gaze was believed to be controlled by ahuman. Specifically, the P1 was more enhanced for validly, relative to invalidly,cued targets only when participants believed the gaze behavior was the result of a mind, rather than of a machine. This shows that sensory gain control can beinfluenced by higher-order (task-irrelevant) beliefs about the observed scene. Wepropose a new interdisciplinary model of social attention, which integrates ideasfrom cognitive and social neuroscience, as well as philosophy in order to providea framework for understanding a crucial aspect of how humans' beliefs about theobserved scene influence sensory processing.
 Considering advice from others is a pervasive element of human social life. Weused the judge-advisor paradigm to investigate the neural correlates of adviceevaluation and advice integration by means of functional magnetic resonanceimaging. Our results demonstrate that evaluating advice recruits the "mentalizingnetwork," brain regions activated when people think about others' mental states. Important activation differences exist, however, depending upon the perceivedcompetence of the advisor. Consistently, additional analyses demonstrate thatintegrating others' advice, i.e., how much participants actually adjust theirinitial estimate, correlates with neural activity in the centromedial amygdala inthe case of a competent and with activity in visual cortex in the case of anincompetent advisor. Taken together, our findings, therefore, demonstrate thatadvice evaluation and integration rely on dissociable neural mechanisms and that significant differences exist depending upon the advisor's reputation, whichsuggests different modes of processing advice depending upon the perceivedcompetence of the advisor.
 There is growing evidence that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) facilitates variousforms of sensitivity to others, but the mechanism by which OT enhances empathy inhumans is unclear. In this study, we examined whether OT increases empathy by theway of blurring the distinction between self and other, or by enhancing thedifference between self and other. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled,within-subject crossover design, empathic responses of healthy participants were compared when imagining oneself (i.e., self-perspective empathy) versus whenimagining the other (i.e., other-perspective empathy) in painful and nonpainfulsituations. Under OT treatment, participants expressed more empathy whenimagining others than when imagining oneself in pain. This was in contrast to theplacebo condition where there were no differences between the empathic responses during the self- and the other-perspective. We propose that the modulatory effectof OT on empathy when taking the other-perspective may be mediated by its role inself- and other-distinctiveness and corollary by its role in increasing salience to social agents and cues.
 Behavioral data supports the commonsense view that babies elicit differentresponses than adults do. Behavioral research also has supported the babyfaceovergeneralization hypothesis that the adaptive value of responding appropriatelyto babies produces a tendency for these responses to be overgeneralized to adultswhose facial structure resembles babies. Here we show a neural substrate forresponses to babies and babyface overgeneralization in the amygdala and thefusiform face area (FFA). Both regions showed greater percentage BOLD signalchange compared with fixation when viewing faces of babies or babyfaced men than maturefaced men. Viewing the first two categories also yielded greater effective connectivity between the two regions. Facial qualities previously shown to elicitstrong neural activation could not account for the effects. Babyfaced men weredistinguished only by their resemblance to babies. The preparedness to respond toinfantile facial qualities generalizes to babyfaced men in perceivers' neuralresponses just as it does in their behavioral reactions.
 The present event-related potential (ERP) study investigated for the first timewhether children with early-onset social anxiety disorder (SAD) process affectivefacial expressions of varying intensities differently than non-anxious controls. Participants were 15 SAD patients and 15 non-anxious controls (mean age of 9years). They were presented with schematic faces displaying anger and happinessat four intensity levels (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%), as well as with neutralfaces. ERPs in early and later time windows (P100, N170, late positivity [LP]),as well as affective ratings (valence and arousal) for the faces, were recorded. SAD patients rated the faces as generally more arousing, regardless of the typeof emotion and intensity. Moreover, they displayed enhanced right-parietal LP(350-650 ms). Both arousal ratings and LP reflect stimulus intensity. Therefore, this study provides first evidence of an intensity amplification bias inpediatric SAD during facial affect processing.
 Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder in humans. It ischaracterized by a postural and kinetic tremor most commonly affecting theforearms and hands. Isolated head tremor has been found in 1-10% of patients,suggesting that ET may be a composite of several phenotypes. The exactpathophysiology of ET is still unknown. ET has been repeatedly shown as adisorder of mild cerebellar degeneration, particularly in postmortem studies.Clinical observations, electrophysiological, volumetric and functional imagingstudies all reinforce the fact that the cerebellum is involved in the generation of ET. However, crucial debate exists as to whether ET is a neurodegenerativedisease. Data suggesting that it is neurodegenerative include postmortem findingsof pathological abnormalities in the brainstem and cerebellum, white matterchanges on diffusion tensor imaging, and clinical studies demonstrating anassociation with cognitive and gait changes. There is also conflicting evidenceagainst ET as a neurodegenerative disease: the improvement of gait abnormalities with ethanol administration, lack of gray matter volume loss on voxel-basedmorphometry, failure to confirm the prominent presence of Lewy bodies in thelocus ceruleus, and other pathological findings. To clarify this issue, futureresearch is needed to describe the mechanism of cellular changes in the ET brain and to understand the order in which they occur. The cerebellum has been shown tobe involved in the timing of movement and sensation, acting as an internal timingsystem that provides the temporal representation of salient events spanninghundreds of milliseconds. It has been reported that cerebellar timing function isaltered in patients with ET, showing an increased variability of rhythmic handmovements as well as diminished performance during predictive motor timing task. Based on current knowledge and observations, we argue that ET is essentiallylinked with cerebellar degeneration, or at least cerebellar dysfunction, togetherwith disturbance of motor timing. We explain the context of our currentunderstanding on this topic, highlighting possible clinical consequences forpatients suffering from ET and future research directions.
 An inherent feature of social interactions is the use of social space orinterpersonal distance-the space between one individual and another. Becausesocial deficits are core symptoms of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), wehypothesized that individuals on this spectrum will exhibit abnormalinterpersonal distance preferences. The literature on interpersonal distance inASD is not conclusive. While some studies show preferences for closer distancesamong this group, others show preferences for farther distances than controls. A common symptom of ASD that may explain the variance in responses to interpersonaldistance in this population is social anxiety (SA), which has been shown tocorrelate with interpersonal distance preferences. In the current study, weinvestigated interpersonal distance preferences in a group of individuals withASD using both behavioral and ERP measures. We found greater variance ininterpersonal distance preferences in the ASD group than in the control group.Furthermore, we showed that this variance can be explained by differences in SAlevel and can be predicted by the N1 amplitude, an early ERP component related toattention and discrimination processes. These results hint at the early sensoryand attentional processes that may be affecting higher social behaviors, both in subclinical and in clinical populations.
 Deficient emotion regulation has been proposed as a crucial pathologicalmechanism in bipolar disorder (BD). We therefore investigated emotion regulation impairments in BD, the related neural underpinnings and their etiologicalrelevance for the disorder. Twenty-two euthymic patients with bipolar-I disorder and 17 unaffected first-degree relatives of BD-I patients, as well as two groups of healthy gender-, age- and education-matched controls (N=22/17, respectively)were included. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging whileapplying two different emotion regulation techniques, reappraisal anddistraction, when presented with emotional images. BD patients and relativesshowed impaired downregulation of amygdala activity during reappraisal, but notduring distraction, when compared with controls. This deficit was correlated withthe habitual use of reappraisal. The negative connectivity of amygdala andorbitofrontal cortex (OFC) observed during reappraisal in controls was reversedin BD patients and relatives. There were no significant differences between BDpatients and relatives. As being observed in BD patients and unaffectedrelatives, deficits in emotion regulation through reappraisal may representheritable neurobiological abnormalities underlying BD. The neural mechanismsinclude impaired control of amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli anddysfunctional connectivity of the amygdala to regulatory control regions in theOFC. These are, thus, important aspects of the neurobiological basis of increasedvulnerability for BD.
 Social closeness is a potent moderator of vicarious affect and specificallyvicarious embarrassment. The neural pathways of how social closeness to anotherperson affects our experience of vicarious embarrassment for the other's publicflaws, failures and norm violations are yet unknown. To bridge this gap, weexamined the neural response of participants while witnessing threats to either afriend's or a stranger's social integrity. The results show consistent responses of the anterior insula (AI) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), shared circuits of the aversive quality of affect, as well as the medial prefrontal cortex andtemporal pole, central structures of the mentalizing network. However, the ACC/AInetwork activation was increased during vicarious embarrassment in response to a friend's failures. At the same time, the precuneus, a brain region associatedwith self-related thoughts, showed a specific activation and an increase infunctional connectivity with the shared circuits in the frontal lobe whileobserving friends. This might indicate a neural systems mechanism for greateraffective sharing and self-involvement while people interact with close othersthat are relevant to oneself.
 Several studies have examined facial expression recognition in pervasivedevelopmental disorder (PDD), including autism and Asperger's disorder, but theresults have been inconsistent. We investigated the relationship between facialexpression recognition and age, face recognition, and symptom severity. Subjects were 28 individuals with mild PDD subtypes and 28 age- and gender-matchedcontrols. Among six emotions, fearful expression recognition was specificallyimpaired in PDD subjects. Age had positive effects on fearful expressionrecognition directly and indirectly via the development of face recognition incontrols, but not in PDD subjects. Furthermore, fearful expression recognitionwas related to the severity of PDD symptoms. We conclude that individuals withPDD show an atypical development of facial expression recognition. Moreover,impaired fearful expression recognition is closely related to social dysfunction.
 Social isolation has been recognized as a major risk factor for morbidity andmortality in humans for more than a quarter century. The brain is the key organof social connections and processes, however, and the same objective socialrelationship can be experienced as caring and protective or as exploitive andisolating. We review evidence that the perception of social isolation (i.e.,loneliness) impacts brain and behavior and is a risk factor for broad-basedmorbidity and mortality. However, the causal role of loneliness on neuralmechanisms and mortality is difficult to test conclusively in humans. Mechanisticanimal studies provide a lens through which to evaluate the neurological effects of a member of a social species living chronically on the social perimeter.Experimental studies show that social isolation produces significant changes inbrain structures and processes in adult social animals. These effects are notuniform across the brain or across species but instead are most evident in brain regions that reflect differences in the functional demands of solitary versussocial living for a particular species. The human and animal literatures havedeveloped independently, however, and significant gaps also exist. The currentreview underscores the importance of integrating human and animal research todelineate the mechanisms through which social relationships impact the brain,health, and well-being.
 While being in the center of attention and exposed to other's evaluations humans are prone to experience embarrassment. To characterize the neural underpinningsof such aversive moments, we induced genuine experiences of embarrassment during person-group interactions in a functional neuroimaging study. Using a mock-upscenario with three confederates, we examined how the presence of an audienceaffected physiological and neural responses and the reported emotionalexperiences of failures and achievements. The results indicated that publicityinduced activations in mentalizing areas and failures led to activations inarousal processing systems. Mentalizing activity as well as attention towards theaudience were increased in socially anxious participants. The convergingintegration of information from mentalizing areas and arousal processing systems within the ventral anterior insula and amygdala forms the neural pathways ofembarrassment. Targeting these neural markers of embarrassment in the(para-)limbic system provides new perspectives for developing treatmentstrategies for social anxiety disorders.
 A large body of research reports that perceiving body movements of other peopleactivates motor representations in the observer's brain. This automatic resonancemechanism appears to be imitative in nature. However, action observation does notinevitably lead to symmetrical motor facilitation: Mirroring the observedmovement might be disadvantageous for successfully performing joint actions. Whatremains unknown is how we are to resolve the possible conflict between theautomatic tendency to "mirror" and the need to perform different context-related complementary actions. By using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation,we found that observation of a double-step action characterized by an implicitcomplementary request engendered a shift from symmetrical simulation toreciprocity in the participants' corticospinal activity. Accordingly,differential motor facilitation was revealed for the snapshots evoking imitative and complementary gestures despite the fact that the observed type of grasp wasidentical. Control conditions in which participants observed the same actionsequence but in a context not implying a complementary request were included aswell. The results provide compelling evidence that when an observed action calls for a nonidentical complementary action, an interplay between the automatictendency to resonate with what is observed and to implicitly prepare for thecomplementary action does emerge. In other words, implicit complementary requestsmight have the ability to draw attention to specific features of the contextaffording nonidentical responses.
 Appropriate processing of human voices with different threat-related emotions is of evolutionarily adaptive value for the survival of individuals. Nevertheless,it is still not clear whether the sensitivity to threat-related information ispresent at birth. Using an odd-ball paradigm, the current study investigated the neural correlates underlying automatic processing of emotional voices of fear andanger in sleeping neonates. Event-related potential data showed that thefronto-central scalp distribution of the neonatal brain could discriminatefearful voices from angry voices; the mismatch response (MMR) was larger inresponse to the deviant stimuli of anger, compared with the standard stimuli offear. Furthermore, this fear-anger MMR discrimination was observed only whenneonates were in active sleep state. Although the neonates' sensitivity tothreat-related voices is not likely associated with a conceptual understanding offearful and angry emotions, this special discrimination in early life may providea foundation for later emotion and social cognition development.
 The psychometric properties of 4 paradigms adapted from the social neuroscienceliterature were evaluated to determine their suitability for use in clinicaltrials of schizophrenia. This 2-site study (University of California, Los Angelesand University of North Carolina) included 173 clinically stable schizophreniaoutpatients and 88 healthy controls. The social cognition battery wasadministered twice to the schizophrenia group (baseline, 4-week retest) and once to the control group. The 4 paradigms included 2 that assess perception ofnonverbal social and action cues (basic biological motion and emotion inbiological motion) and 2 that involve higher level inferences about self andothers' mental states (self-referential memory and empathic accuracy). Eachparadigm was evaluated on (1) patient vs healthy control group differences, (2)test-retest reliability, (3) utility as a repeated measure, and (4) tolerability.Of the 4 paradigms, empathic accuracy demonstrated the strongest characteristics,including large between-group differences, adequate test-retest reliability(.72), negligible practice effects, and good tolerability ratings. The otherparadigms showed weaker psychometric characteristics in their current forms.These findings highlight challenges in adapting social neuroscience paradigms foruse in clinical trials.
 Recent findings have demonstrated that N170 adaptation effects evoked by faceadaptors are general to face and non-face tests, implicating adaptor-lockedinterferences in the rapid adaptation paradigm. Here we examined the extent towhich adaptor-locked interferences confound N170 adaptation effects in different experimental parameters by manipulating the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA)duration and jitter between adaptors and tests. In the short SOA, thoseinterferences were well visible for the grand-average ERP waveforms evoked bytests, and they are likely to render rapid adaptation paradigm with short SOAunreliable. The adaptor-locked interferences were attenuated by appropriatelyincreasing SOA duration, such that face-sensitive adaptation effects were evidentin the long SOA for both baseline-to-peak and peak-to-peak N170 measurements.These findings suggest that the rapid adaptation paradigm may work with arelative long SOA. Our findings provide useful information for future studiesregarding the choosing of appropriate experimental parameters and measurementsfor the rapid adaptation paradigm. In addition, future studies are needed toinvestigate how to objectively subtract the overlaps of adaptors from tests andto validate the N170 adaptation effect with appropriate behavioral performance.
 In social neuroscience, empathy is often approached as an individual ability,whereas researchers in anthropology focus on empathy as a dialectic processbetween agents. In this perspective paper, we argue that to further elucidate themechanisms underlying the development of empathy, social neuroscience researchshould draw on insights and methods from anthropology. First, we discussneuropsychological studies that investigate empathy in inter-relational contexts.Second, we highlight differences between the social neuroscience andanthropological conceptualizations of empathy. Third, we introduce a new studydesign based on a mixed method approach, and present initial results from oneclassroom that was part of a larger study and included 28 children (m = 13, f =15). Participants (aged 9-11) were administered behavioral tasks and a socialnetwork questionnaire; in addition an observational study was also conducted overa period of 3 months. Initial results showed how children's expressions of their empathic abilities were influenced by situational cues in classroom processes.This effect was further explained by children's positions within classroomnetworks. Our results emphasize the value of interdisciplinary research in thestudy of empathy.
 Studies that have carried out experimental evaluation of emotional skills inalcohol-dependence have, up to now, been mainly focused on the exploration ofemotional facial expressions (EFE) decoding. In the present paper, we providesome complements to the recent systematic literature review published by Donadon and de Lima Osorio on this crucial topic. We also suggest research avenues thatmust be, in our opinion, considered in the coming years. More precisely, wepropose, first, that a battery integrating a set of emotional tasks relating todifferent processes should be developed to better systemize EFE decoding measuresin alcohol-dependence. Second, we propose to go below EFE recognition deficitsand to seek for the roots of those alterations, particularly by investigating theputative role played by early visual processing and vision-emotion interactionsin the emotional impairment observed in alcohol-dependence. Third, we insist onthe need to go beyond EFE recognition deficits by suggesting that they onlyconstitute a part of wider emotional deficits in alcohol-dependence. Importantly,since the efficient decoding of emotions is a crucial ability for the developmentand maintenance of satisfactory interpersonal relationships, we suggest thatdisruption of this ability in alcohol-dependent individuals may have adverseconsequences for their social integration. One way to achieve this researchagenda would be to develop the field of affective and social neuroscience ofalcohol-dependence, which could ultimately lead to major advances at boththeoretical and therapeutic levels.
 This study examined neural activity with event-related potentials (ERPs) inmiddle childhood during a computer-simulated ball-toss game, Cyberball. Afterexperiencing fair play initially, children were ultimately excluded by the other players. We focused specifically on "not my turn" events within fair play andrejection events within social exclusion. Dense-array ERPs revealed thatrejection events are perceived rapidly. Condition differences ("not my turn" vs. rejection) were evident in a posterior ERP peaking at 420 ms consistent, with alarger P3 effect for rejection events indicating that in middle childhoodrejection events are differentiated in <500 ms. Condition differences wereevident for slow-wave activity (500-900 ms) in the medial frontal cortical regionand the posterior occipital-parietal region, with rejection events more negative frontally and more positive posteriorly. Distress from the rejection experiencewas associated with a more negative frontal slow wave and a larger late positive slow wave, but only for rejection events. Source modeling with Geosouce software suggested that slow-wave neural activity in cortical regions previouslyidentified in functional imaging studies of ostracism, including subgenualcortex, ventral anterior cingulate cortex, and insula, was greater for rejection events vs. "not my turn" events.
 People may be much less empathic than they think they are. It is not clearwhether patients with schizophrenia who have impaired empathic abilities alsoexhibit diminished ability to accurately appraise their own such skills. Thepresent study aimed to examine: (a) the accuracy of self-appraisal of empathy and(b) the impact of specific cognitive functions on both self-rated andperformance-based empathy in schizophrenia patients and healthy volunteers.Self-reported empathy and performance-based empathy were assessed in 52 chronicpatients with schizophrenia and 45 matched healthy participants with the empathy quotient and the empathy score in the Faux Pas test, respectively.Neuropsychological functioning and symptom severity were also assessed. Nosignificant correlations between self-reported and performance-based empathyscores were found in patients, whereas these correlations were significant andpositive in the control group, with the exception of Faux Pas recognition.Cognitive deficits, specifically in processing speed and theory of mind,negatively affected performance-based but not self-rated empathy inschizophrenia. Patients with less negative and more positive symptoms and lowerset shifting ability reported higher empathic abilities. Self-reported empathyand empathic abilities do not show a simple relationship. Our findings highlight a double deficit related to empathic responding in schizophrenia: diminishedperformance associated with cognitive deficits and inaccurate self-appraisal ofempathic abilities.
 Previous research has demonstrated that before puberty, parents are able tobuffer, and often completely block, cortisol responses to social evaluativestressors (e.g., Trier Social Stress Test; TSST). However, after puberty, parentsno longer provide a powerful buffer of the HPA axis from a social-evaluativestressor. The current study investigates whether friends can buffer the HPA axis in both children and adolescents compared to parents and whether similarstress-ameliorating patterns can also be observed in oxytocin activity. A totalof 109 participants (54 children aged 9-10 and 55 adolescents aged 15-16; half ofeach sex) completed the TSST and were randomly assigned to prepare for theirspeech with their parent or friend for 5 minutes beforehand. Salivary cortisoland urinary oxytocin were measured before and after the TSST. For children,cortisol responses were comparable regardless of who helped the child prepare thespeech. For adolescents, however, friends actually amplified the cortisolresponse compared to parents. In addition, adolescents produced less oxytocinthan children, as did males compared to females. Notably, for boys, oxytocinlevels decreased across the session if participants prepared with a friend ratherthan their parent. The mean change was in the same direction but not significant for girls. These results indicate that friends do not take over the socialbuffering role by age 15-16, which may inform interventions in at-risk childrenand adolescents.
 Social species are so characterized because they form organizations that extendbeyond the individual; such structures evolved hand in hand with psychological,neural, hormonal, cellular, and genetic mechanisms. The goal of socialneuroscience is to identify these biological mechanisms and to specify theinfluences between social and neural structures and processes. Such an endeavoris challenging because it necessitates the integration of theory and data across levels of analysis. Social neuroscience has nevertheless grown dramatically as aninterdisciplinary science and has expanded to include the relationship amongsocial factors, genes, and gene expression.
 Social neuroscience is a relatively new multidisciplinary field which merges the more reductionistic approaches of neuroscience with the more molar perspectivesof social psychology. In this article we report the joint efforts of the authors to develop an effective team-taught course in social neuroscience at theundergraduate level. We review our experiences in developing this course, detail many of the sources currently available for social neuroscience, and provide the results of a detailed student survey of the course. In addition to providing afoundation for others interested in developing a social neuroscience course, itis our opinion that many of the experiences we describe here are applicable toany novel multidisciplinary team teaching endeavor, especially those mergingpsychological disciplines with neuroscience.
 Empathy, which implies a shared interpersonal experience, is implicated in manyaspects of social cognition, notably prosocial behavior, morality and theregulation of aggression. The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the current knowledge in developmental and affective neuroscience with an emphasis onthe perception of pain in others. It will be argued that human empathy involvesseveral components: affective arousal, emotion understanding and emotionregulation, each with different developmental trajectories. These components are implemented by a complex network of distributed, often recursively connected,interacting neural regions including the superior temporal sulcus, insula, medialand orbitofrontal cortices, amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, as well asautonomic and neuroendocrine processes implicated in social behaviors andemotional states. Decomposing the construct of empathy into subcomponents thatoperate in conjunction in the healthy brain and examining their developmentaltrajectory provides added value to our current approaches to understanding human development. It can also benefit our understanding of both typical and atypicaldevelopment.
 Self-regulation of intention formation is pivotal for achieving behavior change. Fantasy realization theory (Oettingen, 2000) assumes that mentally contrasting a desired positive future with present negative reality turns high expectations of success into strong intentions to realize the desired future, while indulging in the positive future fails to do so. The present study tests the theory's process assumption that mental contrasting is a cognitively demanding, purposefulproblem-solving strategy involving working and episodic memory, whereas indulgingis a mindless daydreaming strategy involving the free flow of thought, byinvestigating the neural correlates of the two strategies via continuousmagnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity. We observed greater activity duringmental contrasting (but not indulging) compared to resting in prefrontal,frontal, parietal, and temporal areas, indicating that mental contrastinginvolves strong intention formation, working memory, and episodic memory. Inaddition, heightened activity of occipital areas was observed during mentalcontrasting compared to resting and indulging, suggesting that mentalcontrasting, more than indulging and resting, entails purposefully creatingmental images. Taken together, these findings indicate that mental contrasting isindeed a purposeful problem-solving strategy based on past performance history,whereas indulging is a purposeless daydreaming strategy that is oblivious to pastexperiences.
 Robert Weiss (1973) conceptualised loneliness as perceived social isolation,which he described as a gnawing, chronic disease without redeeming features. Onthe scale of everyday life, it is understandable how something as personallyaversive as loneliness could be regarded as a blight on human existence. However,evolutionary time and evolutionary forces operate at such a different scale oforganisation than we experience in everyday life that personal experience is not sufficient to understand the role of loneliness in human existence. Research overthe past decade suggests a very different view of loneliness than suggested bypersonal experience, one in which loneliness serves a variety of adaptivefunctions in specific habitats. We review evidence on the heritability ofloneliness and outline an evolutionary theory of loneliness, with an emphasis on its potential adaptive value in an evolutionary timescale.
 Sensory trick is an unusual clinical feature in cervical dystonia that attenuatesdisease symptoms by slight touch to a specific area of the face or head. Using a semi-quantitative questionnaire-based study of 197 patients with idiopathiccervical dystonia, we sought to determine probable pathophysiologic correlates,with the wider aim of examining its eventual clinical significance. The typicalsensory trick, i.e., light touch, not necessitating the use of force leading tosimple overpowering of dystonic activity, was present in 83 (42.1 %) patients.The vast majority of the patients required a specific sequence of sensorimotorinputs, including touch sensation on the face or different areas of the head, andalso sensory and motor input of the hand itself. Deviations often led to asignificant decrease in effectiveness and lack of expected benefit. Moreover,patients able to perform the maneuver reported compellingly higher subjectiveeffect of botulinum toxin treatment (median 7 vs. 5 on a scale of 0-10; p <0.0001) and lower depression score (median 10 vs. 14 on the Montgomery AsbergDepression Rating scale; p < 0.001). Overall, the results point to markeddisruption of sensorimotor networks in cervical dystonia. The mechanism of thesensory trick action may be associated with balancing the abnormal activationpatterns by specific sensorimotor inputs. Its presence may be considered apositive predictive factor for responsiveness to botulinum toxin treatment.
 Although trait anxiety has been associated with risk decision making, whether it is related to risk per se or to the feeling of the risk, as well as theunderlying neurocognitive mechanisms, remains unclear. Using a decision-makingtask with a manipulation of frame (i.e., written description of options as apotential gain or loss) and functional magnetic resonance imaging, weinvestigated the neurocognitive relationship between trait anxiety and decisionmaking. The classic framing effect was observed: participants chose the safeoption when it was described as a potential gain, but they avoided the sameoption when it was described as a potential loss. Most importantly, trait anxietywas positively correlated with this behavioral bias. Trait anxiety was alsopositively correlated with amygdala-based "emotional" system activation and itscoupling with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) when decisions wereconsistent with the framing effect, but negatively correlated with the dorsalanterior cingulate cortex (dACC)-based "analytic" system activation and itsconnectivity to the vmPFC when decisions ran counter to the framing effect. Ourfindings suggest that trait anxiety is not associated with subjective riskpreference but an evaluative bias of emotional information in decision making,underpinned by a hyperactive emotional system and a hypoactive analytic system inthe brain.
 Complex social behaviors allow various social organisms to create emergentorganizations that extend beyond the individual. Social neuroscience is aburgeoning field that strives to understand the genetic, hormonal, and neuralmechanisms responsible for these social structures and behaviors. Consequently,social neuroscience is highly interdisciplinary in nature and embraces theapplication of methods ranging from the molecular to the molar to investigate thereciprocal interactions between biological, cognitive, and social levels ofanalysis. The broad scope of such an endeavor introduces particular challengesassociated with the integration of multiple levels of analysis. In the presentmini-review, we highlight some recent findings in the field of socialneuroscience and demonstrate the potential benefits of applying multilevelintegrative analysis to the study of social behavior and its influence onphysiology and health.
 In interactive social situations, it is often crucial to be able to take another person's perspective when evaluating one's own or another person's specifictrait; individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) critically lack thissocial skill. To examine how perspective-dependent self- and other-evaluationprocesses modulate functional connectivity in ASD, we conducted a functionalmagnetic resonance imaging study in which 26 high-functioning adults with ASD and24 typically developed (TD) controls were asked to decide whether an adjectivedescribing a personality trait correctly described the participanthimself/herself ("self") or the participant's mother ("other") by taking eitherthe first (1P) or third person (3P) perspective. We observed that functionalconnectivity between the left sensorimotor cortex and the left middle cingulatecortex was enhanced in TD control individuals taking the 3P perspective, thisenhancement was significantly reduced in ASD, and the degree of reduction wassignificantly correlated with the severity of autistic traits. Furthermore, theself-reference effect on functional connectivity between the left inferiorfrontal cortex and frontopolar cortices was significantly enhanced in TD control individuals taking the 3P perspective, whereas such effect was reversed in ASD.These findings indicate altered effects of perspective on the functionalconnectivity, which may underlie the deficits in social interaction andcommunication observed in individuals with ASD.
 There is accumulating neural evidence to support the existence of two distinctsystems for guiding action selection, a deliberative "model-based" and areflexive "model-free" system. However, little is known about how the braindetermines which of these systems controls behavior at one moment in time. Weprovide evidence for an arbitration mechanism that allocates the degree ofcontrol over behavior by model-based and model-free systems as a function of the reliability of their respective predictions. We show that the inferior lateralprefrontal and frontopolar cortex encode both reliability signals and the output of a comparison between those signals, implicating these regions in thearbitration process. Moreover, connectivity between these regions and model-free valuation areas is negatively modulated by the degree of model-based control inthe arbitrator, suggesting that arbitration may work through modulation of themodel-free valuation system when the arbitrator deems that the model-based systemshould drive behavior.
 Neuroimaging studies with adults have begun to reveal the neural bases ofempathy; however, this research has focused on empathy for physical pain, rather than empathy for negative social experiences. Moreover, this work has notexamined adolescents who may frequently witness and empathize with others thatexperience negative social experiences such as peer rejection. Here, we examined neural activity among early adolescents observing social exclusion compared toobserving inclusion, and how this activity related to both trait empathy andsubsequent prosocial behavior. Participants were scanned while they observed anindividual whom they believed was being socially excluded. At least one day priorto the scan they reported their trait empathy, and following the scan they wrote emails to the excluded victim that were rated for prosocial behavior (e.g.,helping, comforting). Observing exclusion compared to inclusion activated regionsinvolved in mentalizing (i.e., dorsomedial prefrontal cortex), particularly amonghighly empathic individuals. Additionally, individuals who displayed moreactivity in affective, pain-related regions during observed exclusion compared toinclusion subsequently wrote more prosocial emails to excluded victims. Overallfindings suggest that when early adolescents witness social exclusion in theirdaily lives, some may actually 'feel the pain' of the victims and act moreprosocially toward them as a result.
 Although the successful pursuit of long-term goals constitutes an essentialprerequisite to personal development, health, and well-being, little research hasbeen devoted to the understanding of its underlying neural processes. A critical phase in the pursuit of long-term goals is defined as an action crisis,conceptualized as the intra-psychic conflict between further goal pursuit anddisengagement from the goal. In the present research, we applied aninterdisciplinary (cognitive and neural) approach to the analysis of processesunderlying the experience of an action crisis. In Study 1, a longitudinal fieldstudy, action crises in personal goals gave rise to an increased and unbiased(re)evaluation of the costs and benefits (i.e., rewards) of the goal. Study 2 wasa magnetic resonance imaging study examining resting-state functionalconnectivity. The extent of experienced action crises was associated withenhanced fronto-accumbal connectivity signifying increased reward-related impact on prefrontal action control. Action crises, furthermore, mediated therelationship between a dispositional measure of effective goal pursuit (actionorientation) and fronto-accumbal connectivity. The converging and complementaryresults from two methodologically different approaches advance the understanding of the neurobiology of personal long-term goals, especially with respect to therole of rewards in the context of goal-related conflicts.
 Whether emotion is a source of moral judgments remains controversial. This study combined neurophysiological measures, including functional magnetic resonanceimaging, eye-tracking, and pupillary response with behavioral measures assessing affective and moral judgments across age. One hundred and twenty-six participantsaged between 4 and 37 years viewed scenarios depicting intentional versusaccidental actions that caused harm/damage to people and objects. Morally,salient scenarios evoked stronger empathic sadness in young participants and wereassociated with enhanced activity in the amygdala, insula, and temporal poles.While intentional harm was evaluated as equally wrong across all participants,ratings of deserved punishments and malevolent intent gradually became moredifferentiated with age. Furthermore, age-related increase in activity wasdetected in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in response to intentional harm topeople, as well as increased functional connectivity between this region and the amygdala. Our study provides evidence that moral reasoning involves a complexintegration between affective and cognitive processes that gradually changes withage and can be viewed in dynamic transaction across the course of ontogenesis.The findings support the view that negative emotion alerts the individual to the moral salience of a situation by bringing discomfort and thus can serve as anantecedent to moral judgment.
 With a few exceptions, the literature on face recognition and its neural basisderives from the presentation of single faces. However, in many ecologicallytypical situations, we see more than one face, in different communicativecontexts. One of the principal ways in which we interact using our faces iskissing. Although there is no obvious taxonomy of kissing, we kiss in variousinterpersonal situations (greeting, ceremony, sex), with different goals andpartners. Here, we assess the visual cortical responses elicited by viewingdifferent couples kissing with different intents. The study thus lies at thenexus of face recognition, action recognition, and social neuroscience.Magnetoencephalography data were recorded from nine participants in a passiveviewing paradigm. We presented images of couples kissing, with the imagesdiffering along two dimensions, kiss type and couple type. We quantifiedevent-related field amplitudes and latencies. In each participant, the canonical sequence of event-related fields was observed, including an M100, an M170, and a later M400 response. The earliest two responses were significantly modulated inlatency (M100) or amplitude (M170) by the sex composition of the images (withmale-male and female-female pairings yielding faster latency M100 and largeramplitude M170 responses). In contrast, kiss type showed no modulation of anybrain response. The early cortical-evoked fields that we typically associate withthe presentation and analysis of single faces are differentially sensitive tocomplex social and action information in face pairs that are kissing. The earlyresponses, typically associated with perceptual analysis, exhibit a consistentgrouping and suggest a high and rapid sensitivity to the composition of thekissing pairs.
 Importance: Loneliness is a risk factor for depression and other illnesses andmay be caused and reinforced by maladaptive social cognition. Secularizedclassical meditation training programs address social cognition, but practicetypically occurs alone. Little is known about the effectiveness of contemplative practice performed in dyads. Objective: To introduce and assess the effectivenessof contemplative dyadic practices relative to classical-solitary meditation with regard to engagement and perceived social connectedness. Design, Setting, andParticipants: The ReSource Project was a 9-month open-label efficacy trial ofthree, 3-month secularized mental training modules. Replacement randomization wasused to assign 362 healthy participants in Leipzig and Berlin, Germany. Eligible participants were recruited between November 11, 2012, and February 13, 2013, andbetween November 13, 2013, and April 30, 2014. Intention-to-treat analyses wereconducted. Interventions: Breathing meditation and body scan (the presencemodule), loving-kindness meditation and affect dyad (the affect module), andobserving-thoughts meditation and perspective dyad (the perspective module). MainOutcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were self-disclosure and socialcloseness. Engagement measures included compliance (ie, the mean [95% margin oferror] number of meditation sessions that a participant engaged in per week),liking, and motivation to practice. Results: Thirty participants dropped outafter assignment to 3 experimental groups; 90 participants were assigned to aretest control that did not complete the main outcome measures; 16 participantsprovided no state-change data for the affect and perspective modules (226remaining participants; mean age of 41.15 years; 59.3% female). Results areaggregated across training cohorts. Compliance was similar across the modules:loving-kindness meditation (3.78 [0.18] sessions), affect dyad (3.59 [0.14]sessions), observing-thoughts meditation (3.63 [0.20] sessions), and perspective dyad (3.24 [0.18] sessions). Motivation was higher for meditation (11.20 [0.40]sessions) than the dyads (9.26 [0.43] sessions) and was higher for the affectdyad (10.11 [0.46] sessions) than the perspective dyad (8.41 [0.46] sessions).Social closeness increased during a session for the affect dyad (1.49 [0.12]sessions) and the perspective dyad (1.06 [0.12] sessions) and increased over timefor the affect dyad (slope of 0.016 [0.003]) and the perspective dyad (slope of0.012 [0.003]). Self-disclosure increased over time for the affect dyad (slope of0.023 [0.004]) and the perspective dyad (slope of 0.006 [0.005]), increasing moresteeply for the affect dyad (P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: Contemplative dyads elicited engagement similar to classical contemplative practices andincreased perceived social connectedness. Contemplative dyads represent a newtype of intervention targeting social connectedness and intersubjectivecapacities deficient in participants who experience loneliness and in manypsychopathologies.

 We investigated self-regulatory focus (Higgins, 1997, 1998) as one source ofvariation in encoding of, and memory for, emotional words. Participants wroteabout their hopes and aspirations (promotion focus) or duties and obligations(prevention focus). In a subsequent incidental encoding task during functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants evaluated emotional (positive andnegative) and neutral words as either good or bad. A surprise memory testfollowed, outside the scanner. We observed a dissociation in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), where activity during the evaluation task was greater when wordswere focus-consistent (positive for the promotion focus group, negative for theprevention focus group). Similarly, activity in a parahippocampal region wasrelated to subsequent memory, but only for focus-consistent words. Given the roleof the PCC in self-referential processing and episodic retrieval, and theparahippocampus in memory-related processing, these data suggest that regulatory focus influences which items are preferentially associated with self-referential information in memory. Such preferential processing may help explain why eventsare remembered differently by different individuals, which subsequently mayinfluence interpersonal interactions.
 Our ability to process complex social cues presented by faces improves duringadolescence. Using multivariate analyses of neuroimaging data collectedlongitudinally from a sample of 38 adolescents (17 males) when they were 10,11.5, 13 and 15 years old, we tested the possibility that there exists parallelvariations in the structural and functional development of neural systemssupporting face processing. By combining measures of task-related functionalconnectivity and brain morphology, we reveal that both the structural covariance and functional connectivity among 'distal' nodes of the face-processing networkengaged by ambiguous faces increase during this age range. Furthermore, we showthat the trajectory of increasing functional connectivity between the distalnodes occurs in tandem with the development of their structural covariance. This demonstrates a tight coupling between functional and structural maturation withinthe face-processing network. Finally, we demonstrate that increased functionalconnectivity is associated with age-related improvements of face-processingperformance, particularly in females. We suggest that our findings reflectgreater integration among distal elements of the neural systems supporting theprocessing of facial expressions. This, in turn, might facilitate an enhancedextraction of social information from faces during a time when greater importanceis placed on social interactions.
 Reports of age-related changes to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity duringsocio-cognitive tasks have shown both age-equivalence and under recruitment.Emotion work illustrates selective mPFC response dependent on valence, such that negative emotional images evoke increased ventral mPFC activity for youngeradults, while older adults recruit vmPFC more for positive material. By testingwhether this differential age-related response toward valenced material is alsopresent for the social task of forming impressions, we may begin to understandinconsistencies regarding when age differences are present vs. absent in theliterature. Using fMRI, participants intentionally formed impressions of positiveand negative face-behavior pairs in anticipation of a memory task. Extendingprevious findings to a social task, valence-based reversals were present indorsal and ventral mPFC, and posterior cingulate cortex. Younger adults elicited increased activity when forming negative impressions, while older adults had morerecruitment when forming positive impressions. This suggests an age-related shifttoward emphasizing positive social information may be reflected in therecruitment of regions supporting forming impressions. Overall, the resultsindicate an age-related shift in neural response to socio-cognitive stimuli that is valence dependent rather than a general age-related reduction in activity, in part informing prior inconsistencies within the literature.
 The social brain hypothesis generically posits that increasing social group size relates is associated with an increase in neocortex size. A new study identifies,within a species, the specific neural circuit that may confer the primate abilityto manage social relationships as they increase in number.
 Involuntary movements occur in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders andculturally influenced dissociative states (e.g., delusions of alien control andattributions of spirit possession). However, the underlying brain processes arepoorly understood. We combined suggestion and fMRI in 15 highly hypnoticallysusceptible volunteers to investigate changes in brain activity accompanyingdifferent experiences of loss of self-control of movement. Suggestions ofexternal personal control and internal personal control over involuntarymovements modelled delusions of control and spirit possession respectively. Asuggestion of impersonal control by a malfunctioning machine modelled technicaldelusions of control, where involuntary movements are attributed to the influenceof machines. We found that (i) brain activity and/or connectivity significantlyvaried with different experiences and attributions of loss of agency; (ii)compared to the impersonal control condition, both external and internal personalalien control were associated with increased connectivity between primary motorcortex (M1) and brain regions involved in attribution of mental states andrepresenting the self in relation to others; (iii) compared to both personalalien control conditions, impersonal control of movement was associated withincreased activity in brain regions involved in error detection and objectimagery; (iv) there were no significant differences in brain activity, and minor differences in M1 connectivity, between the external and internal personal alien control conditions. Brain networks supporting error detection and object imagery,together with representation of self and others, are differentially recruited to support experiences of impersonal and personal control of involuntary movements. However, similar brain systems underpin attributions and experiences of external and internal alien control of movement. Loss of self-agency for movement cantherefore accompany different kinds of experience of alien control supported bydistinct brain mechanisms. These findings caution against generalization aboutsingle cognitive processes or brain systems underpinning different experiences ofloss of self-control of movement.
 Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to an individual's ability to process andrespond to emotions, including recognizing the expression of emotions in others, using emotions to enhance thought and decision making, and regulating emotions todrive effective behaviors. Despite their importance for goal-directed socialbehavior, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying specific facets of EI. Here, we report findings from a study investigating the neural bases ofthese specific components for EI in a sample of 130 combat veterans withpenetrating traumatic brain injury. We examined the neural mechanisms underlying experiential (perceiving and using emotional information) and strategic(understanding and managing emotions) facets of EI. Factor scores were submitted to voxel-based lesion symptom mapping to elucidate their neural substrates. Theresults indicate that two facets of EI (perceiving and managing emotions) engage common and distinctive neural systems, with shared dependence on the socialknowledge network, and selective engagement of the orbitofrontal and parietalcortex for strategic aspects of emotional information processing. The observedpattern of findings suggests that sub-facets of experiential and strategic EI canbe characterized as separable but related processes that depend upon a corenetwork of brain structures within frontal, temporal and parietal cortex.
 Economic goods may vary on multiple dimensions (determinants). A centralconjecture in decision neuroscience is that choices between goods are made bycomparing subjective values computed through the integration of all relevantdeterminants. Previous work identified three groups of neurons in theorbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of monkeys engaged in economic choices: (1) offervalue cells, which encode the value of individual offers; (2) chosen value cells,which encode the value of the chosen good; and (3) chosen juice cells, whichencode the identity of the chosen good. In principle, these populations could be sufficient to generate a decision. Critically, previous work did not assesswhether offer value cells (the putative input to the decision) indeed encodesubjective values as opposed to physical properties of the goods, and/or whether offer value cells integrate multiple determinants. To address these issues, werecorded from the OFC while monkeys chose between risky outcomes. Confirmingprevious observations, three populations of neurons encoded the value ofindividual offers, the value of the chosen option, and the value-independentchoice outcome. The activity of both offer value cells and chosen value cellsencoded values defined by the integration of juice quantity and probability.Furthermore, both populations reflected the subjective risk attitude of theanimals. We also found additional groups of neurons encoding the risk associated with a particular option, the risky nature of the chosen option, and whether the trial outcome was positive or negative. These results provide substantial supportfor the conjecture described above and for the involvement of OFC in good-baseddecisions.
 Third-party punishment (TPP) for norm violations is an essential deterrent inlarge-scale human societies, and builds on two essential cognitive functions:evaluating legal responsibility and determining appropriate punishment. Despiteconverging evidence that TPP is mediated by a specific set of brain regions,little is known about their effective connectivity (direction and strength ofconnections). Applying parametric event-related functional MRI in conjunctionwith multivariate Granger causality analysis, we asked healthy participants toestimate how much punishment a hypothetical perpetrator deserves forintentionally committing criminal offenses varying in levels of harm. Our resultsconfirmed that TPP legal decisions are based on two domain-general networks: the mentalizing network for evaluating legal responsibility and the central-executivenetwork for determining appropriate punishment. Further, temporal pole (TP) anddorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) emerged as hubs of the mentalizing network,uniquely generating converging output connections to ventromedial PFC,temporo-parietal junction, and posterior cingulate. In particular, dorsomedialPFC received inputs only from TP and both its activation and its connectivity to dorsolateral PFC correlated with degree of punishment. This supports thehypothesis that dorsomedial PFC acts as the driver of the TPP activation pattern,leading to the decision on the appropriate punishment. In conclusion, theseresults advance our understanding of the organizational elements of the TPP brainnetworks and provide better insights into the mental states of judges and jurors tasked with blaming and punishing legal wrongs.
 A foundational aspect of early social-emotional development is the ability todetect and respond to the actions of others who are coordinating their behaviorwith that of the self. Behavioral work in this area has found that infants showparticular preferences for adults who are imitating them rather than adults whoare carrying out noncontingent or mismatching actions. Here, we explore theneural processes related to this tendency of infants to prefer others who actlike the self. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were recorded from14-month-old infants while they were observing actions that either matched ormismatched the action the infant had just executed. Desynchronization of the EEG mu rhythm was greater when infants observed an action that matched their own mostrecently executed action. This effect was strongest immediately prior to theculmination of the goal of the observed action, which is consistent with recentideas about the predictive nature of brain responses during action observation.
 Human footsteps carry a vast amount of social information, which is oftenunconsciously noted. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we analyzedbrain networks activated by footstep sounds of one or two persons walking.Listening to two persons walking together activated brain areas previouslyassociated with affective states and social interaction, such as the subcallosal gyrus bilaterally, the right temporal pole, and the right amygdala. These areasseem to be involved in the analysis of persons' identity and complex socialstimuli on the basis of auditory cues. Single footsteps activated only thebiological motion area in the posterior STS region. Thus, hearing two personswalking together involved a more widespread brain network than did hearingfootsteps from a single person.
 Humans work to improve the situation of others through sympathetic concern. Theempathic joy hypothesis proposes that the urge to help is stimulated by enhanced sensitivity to vicarious joy achieved through helping a recipient to meet theirneeds. We further hypothesized that the positive feeling-related brain activationthat occurs in the striatum during sympathetic concern is enhanced by empathy in a familiarity-dependent manner. To test this, we conducted behavioral andfunctional magnetic resonance imaging experiments in which two participantssimultaneously played a virtual ball-toss game where either the subjects' partneror an unfamiliar player was isolated by the other players. The subjects showedsympathetic behavior by tossing the ball to the isolated player and reportedenhancement of self-positive feelings and anticipation of feeling improvements ofthe isolated player during sympathetic behaviors. Activation in the bilateraldorsal striatum became more prominent during the behaviors, supporting theempathic joy hypothesis. Dorsal striatal activity when helping a romantic partnerpositively correlated with affective empathic traits toward that partner, whereasthe activity measured when helping a stranger positively correlated withperspective-taking traits. The correlation results further revealed afamiliarity-dependent empathic enhancement of positive feelings. Therefore,sympathetic concern is invoked through empathic positive feeling.
 Human values guide behavior and the smooth functioning of societies. Schwartz'scircumplex model of values predicts a sinusoidal waveform in relations betweenratings of the importance of diverse human value types (e.g., achievement,benevolence) and any variables psychologically relevant to them. In thisneuroimaging study, we examined these nonlinear associations between values typesand brain structure. In 85 participants, we found the predicted sinusoidalrelationship between ratings of values types and two measures of white matter(WM), volume and myelin volume fraction, as well as for grey matter (GM)parameters in several frontal regions. These effects reveal new functionalassociations for structural brain parameters and provide a novel cross-validationof Schwartz's model. Moreover, the sinusoidal waveform test can be applied toother circumplex models in social, affective and cognitive neuroscience.
 BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported significant deficits in emotionrecognition among individuals along the frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum.The basis of emotional impairment is still poorly understood and explicit(emotion appraisal) and implicit (autonomic system activity) responses have notbeen carefully evaluated. OBJECTIVE: We investigated explicit evaluation ofemotions by testing valence and arousal using self-report measures and we alsoassessed automatic responses to emotional cues, using autonomic measures (skinconductance response and heart rate). METHODS: 16 behavioral variant FTD and 12agrammatic variants of primary progressive aphasia patients were included. Theperformance of these patients was compared to a group of 14 patients withAlzheimer's disease and 20 healthy controls. Each subject was required to observeand evaluate affective pictures while autonomic parameters were recorded.RESULTS: FTD patients preserved a functional general competency in terms ofvalence (correct positive versus negative attribution) and arousal (correctdichotomy between high versus low arousal category) distinction. These patientsshowed significant changes in autonomic implicit response compared to the othergroups. The mismatch between explicit and implicit responsiveness to emotionalcues was found both in behavioral variant FTD and in agrammatic variants ofprimary progressive aphasia. Emotional responsiveness was related to the severityof behavioral abnormalities as measured by the Frontal Behavioral Inventory andassociated with atrophy of the left putamen. CONCLUSION: The present findingsindicate that FTD patients are able to explicitly "appraise" the emotion, butthey cannot implicitly "feel" the emotion. This mismatch between the two levelsmay help explain the general emotional behavior impairment found in thesepatients.
 Under standard models of expected utility, preferences over stochastic events areassumed to be independent of the source of uncertainty. Thus, in decision-making,an agent should exhibit consistent preferences, regardless of whether theuncertainty derives from the unpredictability of a random process or theunpredictability of a social partner. However, when a social partner is thesource of uncertainty, social preferences can influence decisions over and above pure risk attitudes (RA). Here, we compared risk-related hemodynamic activity andindividual preferences for two sets of options that differ only in the social or non-social nature of the risk. Risk preferences in social and non-social contextswere systematically related to neural activity during decision and outcome phasesof each choice. Individuals who were more risk averse in the social contextexhibited decreased risk-related activity in the amygdala during non-socialdecisions, while individuals who were more risk averse in the non-social context exhibited the opposite pattern. Differential risk preferences were similarlyassociated with hemodynamic activity in ventral striatum at the outcome of these decisions. These findings suggest that social preferences, including aversion to betrayal or exploitation by social partners, may be associated with variabilityin the response of these subcortical regions to social risk.
 Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show impaired emotionalresponses to self-face processing, but the underlying neural bases are unclear.Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated brain activity when 15 individuals with high-functioning ASD and 15 controls rated the photogenicity of self-face images and photographs of others' faces. Controls showed a strongcorrelation between photogenicity ratings and extent of embarrassment evoked byself-face images; this correlation was weaker among ASD individuals, indicating adecoupling between the cognitive evaluation of self-face images and emotionalresponses. Individuals with ASD demonstrated relatively low self-related activityin the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), which was related to specific autistictraits. There were significant group differences in the modulation of activity byembarrassment ratings in the right insular (IC) and lateral orbitofrontalcortices. Task-related activity in the right IC was lower in the ASD group. Thereduced activity in the right IC for self-face images was associated with weakcoupling between cognitive evaluation and emotional responses to self-faceimages. The PCC is responsible for self-referential processing, and the IC plays a role in emotional experience. Dysfunction in these areas could contribute tothe lack of self-conscious behaviors in response to self-reflection in ASDindividuals.
 Perceivers rapidly process social category information and form stereotypicimpressions of unfamiliar others. However, a goal to individuate a target or toaccurately predict their behavior can result in individuated impressions. It isunknown how the combination of both accuracy and individuation goals affectsperceptual category processing. To explore this, participants were given both thegoal to individuate targets and accurately predict behavior. We then recordedevent-related brain potentials while participants viewed photos of black andwhite males along with four pieces of individuating information in the form ofdescriptions of past behavior. Even with explicit individuation and accuracy taskgoals, participants rapidly differentiated targets by race within 200 ms.Importantly, this rapid categorical processing did not influence behavioraloutcomes as participants made individuated predictions. These findings indicatethat individuals engage in category processing even when provided withindividuation and accuracy goals, but that this processing does not necessarilyresult in category-based judgments.
 A sequential prisoner's dilemma game was combined with psychophysiologicalmeasures to examine the cognitive underpinnings of reciprocal exchange.Participants played four rounds of the game with partners who either cooperatedor cheated. In a control condition, the partners' faces were shown, but nointeraction took place. The partners' behaviors were consistent in the firstthree rounds of the game, but in the last round some of the partners unexpectedlychanged strategies. In the first round of the game, the feedback about apartner's decision elicited a feedback P300, which was more pronounced forcooperation and cheating in comparison to the control condition, but did not varyas a function of feedback valence. In the last round, both the feedbacknegativity and the feedback P300 were sensitive to expectancy violations. Therewas no consistent evidence for a negativity bias, that is, enhanced allocation ofattention to feedback about another person's cheating in comparison to feedbackabout another person's cooperation. Instead, participants focused on bothpositive and negative information, and flexibly adjusted their processing biases to the diagnosticity of the information. This conclusion was corroborated by the ERP correlates of memory retrieval. Successful retrieval of a partner'sreputation was associated with an anterior positivity between 400 and 600 msafter face onset. This anterior positivity was more pronounced for bothcooperator and cheater faces in comparison to control faces. The results suggest that it is not the negativity of social information, but rather its motivational and behavioral relevance that determines its processing.
 Intranasal oxytocin has been shown to alter self-perceptions of personality(e.g., more trusting, increased extraversion). To follow up these findings, weexamined the acute effects of two doses of intranasal oxytocin (24 IU and 48 IU) on another form of self-referential cognition: autobiographical memory. Changesin autobiographical memory (personal memories for the past) could conceivablyeffect change in self-perception and consequently alter social behaviors. Wepredicted that oxytocin would increase the number of specific personal memoriesrecalled, and promote the recall of positive social affiliation memories.Seventeen male participants self-administered a placebo or oxytocin (24 IU, 48IU) using a nasal spray on three separate occasions in a placebo-controlled,double-blind, and within-subject experiment. Participants completed theAutobiographical Memory Test (AMT) 110 minutes later. Analyses revealed aquadratic dose-response curve for the effects of intranasal oxytocin onautobiographical memory recall. The 24 IU dose, relative to the 48 IU dose andplacebo, increased the number of specific personal memories recalled and promotedthe recall of social affiliation memories that were rated more positively. Thelack of effect with the 48 IU dose could be due to saturation of the oxytocinreceptors at higher doses. Changes in autobiographical memory may be onemechanism by which oxytocin alters prosocial worldviews.
 Social psychological and developmental research revealed that imitation serves a fundamental social function. It has been shown that human beings have thetendency to automatically mirror the behavior of others-the so-called chameleoneffect. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that being imitated leads topositive feelings toward the imitator. But why do we feel more positive aboutsomeone who imitates us? In the current fMRI study we aimed at exploring theneural correlates of the positive consequences of being imitated by means of anobservation paradigm. Our results indicate that being imitated compared to notbeing imitated activates brain areas that have been associated with emotion andreward processing, namely medial orbitofrontal cortex/ventromedial prefrontalcortex (mOFC/vmPFC, GLM whole-brain contrast). Moreover mOFC/vmPFC shows highereffective connectivity with striatum and mid-posterior insula during beingimitated compared to not being imitated.
 Humans often judge others egocentrically, assuming that they feel or thinksimilarly to themselves. Emotional egocentricity bias (EEB) occurs in situations when others feel differently to oneself. Using a novel paradigm, we investigated the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the developmental capacity to overcomesuch EEB in children compared with adults. We showed that children display astronger EEB than adults and that this correlates with reduced activation inright supramarginal gyrus (rSMG) as well as reduced coupling between rSMG andleft dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) in children compared with adults.Crucially, functional recruitment of rSMG was associated with age-relateddifferences in cortical thickness of this region. Although in adults the merepresence of emotional conflict occurs between self and other recruited rSMG,rSMG-lDLPFC coupling was only observed when implementing empathic judgements.Finally, resting state analyses comparing connectivity patterns of rSMG with thatof right temporoparietal junction suggested a unique role of rSMG for self-other distinction in the emotional domain for adults as well as for children. Thus,children's difficulties in overcoming EEB may be due to late maturation ofregions distinguishing between conflicting socio-affective information andrelaying this information to regions necessary for implementing accuratejudgments.
 Due to its ability to map an observed action onto the observer's own corticalmotor circuits, the mirror neuron system (MNS) has been implicated in many facetsof social cognition. As such, achieving an understanding of the typicaldevelopment of this intriguing brain system seems obvious. Only now, however, arestudies attempting to explore the processes and principles behind the emergenceof the MNS. This article critically reviews a number of experimental paradigmsemployed in this endeavor. We conclude by suggesting that future neuroscientific investigations should incorporate a response-stimulus procedure, whereby actionexecution results in, not from, novel sensory stimuli.
 The present study aimed to reveal the temporal course and electrophysiologicalcorrelates of interpersonal guilt. Human participants were asked to performmultiple rounds of a dot-estimation task with their partners, while event-relatedpotential being recorded. The paired participants were informed that they wouldwin money if both responded correctly; otherwise, both of them would lose money. The feeling of guilt in Self-Wrong condition (SW) was significantly higher thanthat in Both-Wrong and Partner-Wrong conditions. At approximately 350 ms afterthe onset of feedback presentation, greater negativities were observed in thefrontal regions in the guilt condition (i.e., SW) than those in the non-guiltcondition. The guilt-modulated frontal negativity might reflect the interactions of self-reflection, condemnation, and negative emotion.
 Imitation is thought to require a perception-action matching process thatutilizes the "mirror neuron" system, but other cognitive functions such as error detection may also be required for even simple imitation. We sought to explorethe core neural substrate of imitation by examining the imitation of simplefinger actions using fMRI. Participants observed one of two actions and wereinstructed to imitate the action they observed, or to perform the alternativenon-matching action. The contrast between imitation and non-matching actions was associated with activation in areas previously associated with imitation and"mirror neuron" functioning, including insula, intraparietal sulcus, dorsalpremotor cortex, and superior temporal gyrus. Imitation was also specificallyassociated with activity in areas of prefrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontalcortex (OFC), amygdala, red nucleus, thalamus, hippocampus, and substantia nigra.We suggest that lateral OFC responds to action-perception mismatch and otherclusters reflect working memory, motor planning, associative learning, andvisuo-motor integration of goal-directed action. Although computational modelshave predicted integration of these functions to enable imitation, their specificbrain bases have not previously been identified. Together they offer apotentially powerful means through which matching one's actions to those ofothers can lead to behavioral modification and development.
 The main focus of the current study was to assess whether executive functions(EFs) moderate the effect of parental punishment on adolescent aggression. Thesample were 370 participants (53% girls, 47% boys) enrolled at secondary andhigher secondary levels and ranged in age between 13-19 years (M = 15.5, SD =1.3). Participants were assessed on a self-report measure of aggression and twopunishment measures, in addition to a demographic sheet. Then, they wereindividually assessed on four tests taken from the Delis-Kaplan ExecutiveFunctions System (D-KEFS) namely Trial Making Test (TMT), Design Fluency Test(DFT), Color Word Interference Test (CWIT), and Card Sorting Test (CST) to assesscognitive flexibility, nonverbal fluency, inhibition, and problem-solvingability, respectively. Correlation coefficients indicated that all four executivefunctioning measures and the two punishment measures were significantlycorrelated with aggression. Moderation analysis indicated that all EFs moderated the relationship between physical punishment and aggression, and only inhibition and problem-solving ability, but not cognitive flexibility and nonverbal fluency,moderated the relations between symbolic punishment and aggression. The findings support the hypothesis that EFs are protective personal factors that promotehealthy adolescent adjustment in the presence of challenging environmentalfactors.
 The extent of the attentional blink effect on detection rates in rapid serialvisual presentations is modulated by the emotionality of the stimuli. Emotionallysalient stimuli are detected more often, even if presented in the attentionalblink period, and elicit an enlarged P3 response, which has been interpreted asenhanced consolidation. This effect correlates with individual differences intrait affectivity such as anxiety or dysphoria. Here, we ask if it is alsorelated to the capacity to detect emotions in others, i.e., to interpersonalsocial traits. We therefore presented emotional and neutral images depictingsocial scenes as targets in an attentional blink design and measured detectionrates and event-related potentials. In addition, we recorded self-reports ofempathy as measured by the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. The results showenhanced performance for emotional stimuli and increased P3 amplitudes, whichcorrelated with individual differences in empathy. The data suggest thatself-reported empathy goes along with enhanced processing of emotion in socialstimuli, even under stimulus conditions that are suboptimal for conscious target detection.
 Objectives: This study examines the neural mechanisms that mediate therelationship between phosphatidylcholine and executive functions in cognitivelyintact older adults. We hypothesized that higher plasma levels ofphosphatidylcholine are associated with better performance on a particularcomponent of the executive functions, namely cognitive flexibility, and that thisrelationship is mediated by gray matter structure of regions within theprefrontal cortex (PFC) that have been implicated in cognitive flexibility.Methods: We examined 72 cognitively intact adults between the ages of 65 and 75in an observational, cross-sectional study to investigate the relationshipbetween blood biomarkers of phosphatidylcholine, tests of cognitive flexibility(measured by the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Trail Making Test), andgray matter structure of regions within the PFC. A three-step mediation analysis was implemented using multivariate linear regressions and we controlled for age, sex, education, income, depression status, and body mass index. Results: Themediation analysis revealed that gray matter thickness of one region within thePFC, the left inferior PFC (Brodmann's Area 45), mediates the relationshipbetween phosphatidylcholine blood biomarkers and cognitive flexibility.Conclusion: These results suggest that particular nutrients may slow or preventage-related cognitive decline by influencing specific structures within thebrain. This report demonstrates a novel structural mediation between plasmaphosphatidylcholine levels and cognitive flexibility. Future work should examine the potential mechanisms underlying this mediation, includingphosphatidylcholine-dependent cell membrane integrity of the inferior PFC andphosphatidylcholine-dependent cholinergic projections to the inferior PFC.
 Impaired social cognition has been claimed to be a mechanism underlying thedevelopment and maintenance of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Oneimportant aspect of social cognition is the theory of mind (ToM), a complex skillthat seems to be influenced by more basic processes, such as executive functions (EF) and emotion recognition. Previous ToM studies in BPD have yieldedinconsistent results. This study assessed the performance of BPD adults on ToM,emotion recognition, and EF tasks. We also examined whether EF and emotionrecognition could predict the performance on ToM tasks. We evaluated 15 adultswith BPD and 15 matched healthy controls using different tasks of EF, emotionrecognition, and ToM. The results showed that BPD adults exhibited deficits inthe three domains, which seem to be task-dependent. Furthermore, we found that EFand emotion recognition predicted the performance on ToM. Our results suggestthat tasks that involve real-life social scenarios and contextual cues are moresensitive to detect ToM and emotion recognition deficits in BPD individuals. Our findings also indicate that (a) ToM variability in BPD is partially explained by individual differences on EF and emotion recognition; and (b) ToM deficits of BPDpatients are partially explained by the capacity to integrate cues from face,prosody, gesture, and social context to identify the emotions and others'beliefs.
 Polymorphisms in noncoding regions of the vasopressin 1a receptor gene (Avpr1a)are associated with a variety of socioemotional characteristics in humans,chimpanzees, and voles, and may impact behavior through a site-specific variationin gene expression. The socially monogamous prairie vole offers a uniqueopportunity to study such neurobiological control of individual differences incomplex behavior. Vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) signaling is necessary for theformation of the pair bond in males, and prairie voles exhibit greater V1aRbinding in the reward-processing ventral pallidum than do asocial voles of thesame genus. Diversity in social behavior within prairie voles has been correlatedto natural variation in neuropeptide receptor expression in specific brainregions. Here we use RNA interference to examine the causal relationship between intraspecific variation in V1aR and behavioral outcomes, by approximating thedegree of naturalistic variation in V1aR expression. Juvenile male prairie voles were injected with viral vectors expressing shRNA sequences targeting Avpr1a mRNAinto the ventral pallidum. Down-regulation of pallidal V1aR density resulted in asignificant impairment in the preference for a mated female partner and areduction in anxiety-like behavior in adulthood. No effect on alloparenting wasdetected. These data demonstrate that within-species naturalistic-like variation in V1aR expression has a profound effect on individual differences in socialattachment and emotionality. RNA interference may prove to be a useful technique to unite the fields of behavioral ecology and neurogenetics to performethologically relevant studies of the control of individual variation and offerinsight into the evolutionary mechanisms leading to behavioral diversity.
 This fMRI work studies brain activity of healthy volunteers who manipulated avirtual object in the context of a digital game by applying two different controlmethods: using their right hand or using their gaze. The results show extendedactivations in sensorimotor areas, not only when participants played in thetraditional way (using their hand) but also when they used their gaze to control the virtual object. Furthermore, with the exception of the primary motor cortex, regional motor activity was similar regardless of what the effector was: the arm or the eye. These results have a potential application in the field of theneurorehabilitation as a new approach to generate activation of the sensorimotor system to support the recovery of the motor functions.
 OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe chiropractic care use at theWorld Games 2013. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed treatmentcharts of athletes and non-athletes who sought chiropractic care at The WorldGames in Cali, Colombia, from July 25 to August 4, 2013. Doctors of chiropractic of the International Federation of Sports Chiropractic provided care. Chart notesincluded body region treated, treatment modality, and pretreatment andposttreatment pain ratings. RESULTS: Of the participants, 537 of 2964 accredited athletes and 403 of 4131 accredited non-athletes sought chiropractic treatment;these represent utilization rates of 18.1% for athletes and 9.8% fornon-athletes. A total of 1463 treatments were recorded for athletes (n = 897) andnon-athletes (n = 566). The athletes who were treated represented 28 of 33 sportsand 68 of 93 countries that were present at the games. Among athletes, thethoracic spine was the most frequent area of treatment (57.2%), followed by thelumbar spine (48.7%) and the cervical spine (38.9%). Myotherapy was the mostfrequently used treatment method (80.9%), followed by chiropractic manipulation(78.5%), taping (38.0%), and mobilization (24.6%). Reports of acute injury werehigher among athletes (45.4%) compared with non-athletes (23.8%). Reported painwas reduced after treatment (P < .001), and 86.9% patients reported immediateimprovement after receiving chiropractic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of people seeking chiropractic care at an international sporting competition wereathletes. For those seeking care, the injury rate was higher among athletes than among non-athletes. The majority of patients receiving chiropractic care reportedimprovement after receiving care.
 East Asians and Asian-Americans tend to allocate relatively greater attention to background context compared to European Americans across a variety of cognitiveand neural measures. We sought to extend these findings of cultural differencesto affective stimuli using the N400, which has been shown to be sensitive to deepprocessing of affective information. The degree to which Asian-Americans andEuropean Americans responded to semantic incongruity between emotionallyexpressive faces (i.e., smiling or frowning) and background affective scenes was measured. As predicted, Asian-Americans showed a greater N400 to incongruenttrials than to congruent trials. In contrast, European Americans showed nodifference in amplitude across the two conditions. Furthermore, greater affectiveN400 incongruity was associated with higher interdependent self-construals. Thesedata suggest that Asian-Americans and those with interdependent self-construalsprocess the relationship between perceived facial emotion and affectivebackground context to a greater degree than European Americans and those withindependent self-construals. Implications for neural and cognitive differences ineveryday social interactions, and cultural differences in analytic and holisticthinking are discussed.
 Research suggests that heart rate variability (HRV) is a physiological indicator of the flexibility of the autonomic nervous system and can provide an objectivemeasure of an individual's ability to appropriately match emotional responses to environmental demands. The present study investigated whether angry response toemotional stimuli was related to HRV, and whether manipulation of HRV usingbiofeedback could change the anger response in a healthy adult population.Fifty-eight participants received HRV biofeedback (n = 29) or an active controlcondition (n = 29). HRV measures included standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) power, and wasrecorded across three sessions: baseline, training, and anger induction. Theanger induction procedure resulted in increased subjective experience of anger,as well as physiological changes. The biofeedback group had higher HRV thanactive controls both during the training session (SDNN and LF HRV) and duringanger induction (LF HRV). HRV during anger induction was significantly associatedwith self-reported emotional response for participants receiving biofeedback but not for active controls. Results provide support for HRV as an index of emotionregulation, specifically anger. Further research is needed to determine whetherlong-term HRV biofeedback can have a lasting effect on managing anger.
 Socially anxious individuals are characterized as those with distorted negativeself-beliefs (NSBs), which are thought to enhance reactions of social distress(emotional reactivity) and social avoidance (social functioning). However, itremains unclear whether individual differences in social distress and socialavoidance are represented by differences in brain morphometry. To probe intothese neural correlates, we analyzed magnetic resonance images of a sample of 130healthy subjects and used the Connectome Computation System (CCS) to evaluatethese factors. The results showed that social distress was correlated with thecortical volume of the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the subcorticalvolume of the left amygdala, while social avoidance was correlated with thecortical volume of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).Additionally, loneliness might mediate the relationship between the amygdalavolume and the social distress score. Our results demonstrated that socialdistress and social avoidance were represented by segregated cortical regions in the healthy individuals. These findings might provide a valuable basis forunderstanding the stable brain structures underlying individual differences insocial anxiety.
 Empathy shapes the landscape of our social lives. It motivates prosocial andcaregiving behaviors, plays a role in inhibiting aggression, and facilitatescooperation between members of a similar social group. Thus, empathy is oftenconceived as a driving motivation of moral behavior and justice, and as such,everyone would think that it should be cultivated. However, the relationshipsbetween empathy, morality, and justice are complex. We begin by explaining whatthe notion of empathy encompasses and then argue how sensitivity to others' needshas evolved in the context of parental care and group living. Next, we examinethe multiple physiological, hormonal, and neural systems supporting empathy andits functions. One troubling but important corollary of this neuro-evolutionarymodel is that empathy produces social preferences that can conflict with fairnessand justice. An understanding of the factors that mold our emotional response andcaring motivation for others helps provide organizational principles andultimately guides decision-making in medical ethics.
 Advances in understanding neural processes open the possibility of usingbrain-based measures to compose collaborative work teams. Neuroimaging studieshave shown that individual differences in patterns of brain activity can predict differences in performance of specific tasks. We extended this finding byexamining performance not simply by a single brain, but by pairs of brains. Weused measures derived from brain-based studies to compose 100 two-person teams inwhich members' roles were either congruent or incongruent with their individualabilities. The assessed abilities are rooted in the visual system, whichcomprises independent "spatial" and "object" subsystems. The team task requiredone member to navigate through a virtual maze (a spatial task) and the other toremember "tag" repetitions of complex "greebles" (an object-properties task).Teams in which members' role assignments were congruent with their abilitiesperformed better than incongruent teams and teams in which both members scoredhigh on only one of the abilities. In addition, verbal collaboration enabledmembers of incongruent teams to overcome their compositional disadvantage but didnot enhance the performance of congruent teams-and actually impaired performance in teams in which both members were adept in only one of the two necessaryabilities. The findings show that knowledge about brain systems can not only beused to compose teams, but also provides insights into how teams can bestperform.
 In the last several decades, sophisticated experimental techniques have been usedto determine the neurobiology of the oxytocin and vasopressin systems in rodents.Using a suite of methodologies, including electrophysiology, site-specificselective pharmacology, receptor autoradiography, in vivo microdialysis, andgenetic and optogenetic manipulations, we have gained unprecedented knowledgeabout how these neuropeptides engage neural circuits to regulate behaviour,particularly social behaviour. Based on this foundation of information fromrodent studies, we have started generating new hypotheses and frameworks abouthow the oxytocin and vasopressin systems could be acting in humans to influencesocial cognition. However, despite the recent inundation of publications usingintranasal oxytocin in humans, we still know very little about theneurophysiology of the oxytocin system in primates more broadly. Furthermore, thedesign and analysis of these human studies have remained largely uninformed ofthe potential neurobiological mechanisms underlying their findings. Although the methods available for studying the oxytocin and vasopressin systems in humans areincredibly limited as a result of practical and ethical considerations, there is great potential to fill the gaps in our knowledge by developing better nonhumanprimate models of social functioning. Behavioural pharmacology and receptorautoradiography have been used to study the oxytocin and vasopressin systems innonhuman primates, and there is now great potential to broaden our understanding of the neurobiology of these systems. In this review, we discuss comparativefindings in receptor distributions in rodents and primates, with perspectives on the functionality of conserved regions of expression in these distinct mammalian clades. We also identify specific ways that established technologies can be used to answer basic research questions in primates. Finally, we highlight areas offuture research in nonhuman primates that are experimentally poised to yieldcritical insights into the anatomy, physiology and behavioural effects of theoxytocin system, given its remarkable translational potential.
 It has been postulated that when people engage in joint actions they forminternal representations not only of their part of the joint task but of theirco-actors' parts of the task as well. However, empirical evidence for this claim is scarce. By means of high-density electroencephalography, this studyinvestigated whether one represents and simulates the action of an interactionpartner when planning to perform a joint action. The results showed that jointaction planning compared with individual action planning resulted in amplitudemodulations of the frontal P3a and parietal P3b event-related potentials, whichare associated with stimulus classification, updating of representations, anddecision-making. Moreover, there was evidence for anticipatory motor simulationof the partner's action in the amplitude and peak latency of the late, motor partof the Contingent Negative Variation, which was correlated with joint actionperformance. Our results provide evidence that when people engage in joint tasks,they represent in advance each other's actions in order to facilitatecoordination.
 Adopting new versions of the false belief and "false" photo vignettes used bySaxe & Kanwisher (2003) we were able to show activation in all five areaspreviously reported. Activations by added false sign and temporal change control vignettes in these areas showed that the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ-R) is specifically associated with processing mental states like belief. Incontrast, TPJ-L was also activated by false signs suggesting an association with processing perspective differences for mental and non-mental objects in line withwork on visual perspective tasks. A similar, but less clearly interpretablepattern of activations was also found in the middle temporal gyrus, precuneus andin the MPFC. These results are discussed in relation to findings in normaldevelopment where false belief and false sign tasks associate more strongly with each other than does each of them with the "false" photo task.
 The present research addressed the question of where memories for emotional wordscould be represented in the brain. A second main question was related to theeffect of personality traits, in terms of the Behavior Activation System (BAS),in emotional word recognition. We tested the role of the left DLPFC (LDLPFC) byperforming a memory task in which old (previously encoded targets) and new(previously not encoded distractors) positive or negative emotional words had to be recognized. High-BAS and low-BAS subjects were compared when a repetitive TMS (rTMS) was applied on the LDLPFC. We found significant differences betweenhigh-BAS vs. low-BAS subjects, with better performance for high-BAS in responseto positive words. In parallel, an increased left cortical activity (alphadesynchronization) was observed for high-BAS in the case of positive words. Thus,we can conclude that the left approach-related hemisphere, underlying BAS, maysupport faster recognition of positive words.
 Compound L-368,899 was successfully alkylated with [(11)C]iodomethane to generatethe oxytocin receptor selective(2R)-2-amino-N-((2S)-7,7-dimethyl-1-(((4-(o-tolyl)piperazin-1-yl)sulfonyl)methyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-yl)-N-[(11)C]methyl-3-(methylsulfonyl)propanamide([(11)C]1) with very high radiochemical purity and high specific activity. PETimaging studies were performed with [(11)C]1 to investigate brain penetration andoxytocin receptor uptake using rat and cynomolgus monkey models. For rat baselinescans, brain penetration was observed with [(11)C]1, but no specific uptake couldbe distinguished in the brain region. By administering a peptide oxytocinreceptor selective antagonist for peripheral blocking of oxytocin receptors, the uptake of [(11)C]1 was amplified in the rat brain temporarily to enable somevisual uptake within the rat brain. A baseline scan of [(11)C]1 in a cynomolgusmonkey model resulted in no detectable specific uptake in anticipated regions,but activity did accumulate in the choroid plexus.
 Behavioral and neurological studies have revealed that emotions influence moralcognition. Although moral stimuli are emotionally charged, the time course ofinteractions between emotions and moral judgments remains unknown. In the presentstudy, we investigated the temporal dynamics of the interaction between emotionalprocesses and moral cognition. The results revealed that when making moraljudgments, the time course of the event-related potential (ERP) waveform wassignificantly different between high emotional arousal and low emotional arousal contexts. Different stages of processing were distinguished, showing distinctive interactions between emotional processes and moral reasoning. The precise timecourse of moral intuition and moral reasoning sheds new light on theoreticalmodels of moral psychology. Specifically, the N1 component (interpreted asrepresenting moral intuition) did not appear to be influenced by emotionalarousal. However, the N2 component and late positive potential were stronglyaffected by emotional arousal; the slow wave was influenced by both emotionalarousal and morality, suggesting distinct moral processing at different emotionalarousal levels.
 As a complex trait, loneliness is likely to be influenced by the interplay ofnumerous genetic and environmental factors. Studies in behavioral geneticsindicate that loneliness has a sizable degree of heritability. Candidate-gene andgene-expression studies have pointed to several genes related toneurotransmitters and the immune system. The notion that these genes are related to loneliness is compatible with the basic tenets of the evolutionary theory ofloneliness. Research on gene-environment interactions indicates thatsocial-environmental factors (e.g., low social support) may have a morepronounced effect and lead to higher levels of loneliness if individuals carrythe sensitive variant of these candidate genes. Currently, there is no extantresearch on loneliness based on genome-wide association studies,gene-environment-interaction studies, or studies in epigenetics. Such studieswould allow researchers to identify networks of genes that contribute toloneliness. The contribution of genetics to loneliness research will becomestronger when genome-wide genetics and epigenetics are integrated and used along with well-established methods in psychology to analyze the complex process ofgene-environment interplay.
 Infants are sensitive to the referential information conveyed by others' eyegaze, which could be one of the developmental foundations of theory of mind. Toinvestigate the neural correlates of gaze-object relations, we recorded ERPs fromadults and 9-month-old infants while they watched scenes containing gaze shiftseither towards or away from the location of a preceding object. In adults,object-incongruent gaze shifts elicited enhanced ERP amplitudes over theoccipito-temporal area (N330). In infants, a similar posterior ERP component(N290) was greater for object-incongruent gaze shifts, which suggests that by theage of 9 months infants encode referential information of gaze in a similar wayto adults. In addition, in infants we observed an early frontal ERP component(anterior N200), which showed higher amplitude in response to the perception ofobject-congruent gaze shifts. This component may reflect fast-track processing ofsocially relevant information, such as the detection of communicative orinformative situations, and could form a developmental foundation for attentionsharing, social learning and theory of mind.
 Early life experience and socioeconomic status (SES) are well-establishedpredictors of health outcomes in people. Both factors likely influence healthoutcomes via hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation. However, it isunclear how early experience and HPA axis activity influence adult social status.We studied differentially reared female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta, N = 90)as models to test the hypothesis that chronic HPA axis activity assessed via haircortisol concentrations (HCCs) mediated the relationship between early lifeexperience and adult social rank. We found that mother-peer-reared (MPR) monkeys acquired higher social ranks than either of the two nursery-reared (NR) groups(peer-reared, PR, or surrogate-peer-reared, SPR monkeys) (beta = -0.07, t(89) =-2.16, p = 0.034). We also found that MPR HCCs were lower during the juvenileperiod at 18 months (F(2,25) = 3.49, p = 0.047). Furthermore, for MPR but not NR monkeys, changes in HCCs from 18 to 24 months (r(s) = -0.627, p = 0.039) andadult HCCs (r(s) = -0.321, p = 0.03) were negatively correlated with adult socialrank. These findings suggest that chronic HPA axis regulation in juvenility, and perhaps in adulthood, may influence adult social status for primates thatexperience typical early rearing. However, early life adversity may result indissociation between neuroendocrine stress regulation and adult socialcompetence, which may be risk factors for adverse health outcomes.
 Children with high resistance to peer influences differ from their low-resistancecounterparts in the degree of functional connectivity in fronto-parietal andprefrontal cortical networks. Here we explored the possibility that the degree ofmorphological similarities across the same cortical regions also varies as afunction of this behavioral trait. Using structural magnetic-resonance (MR)images, we measured cortical thickness in a total of 295 adolescents (12 to 18years of age). We found that inter-regional correlations in cortical thicknessincreased with the resistance to peer influence (RPI); this was especially thecase, in female adolescents, in the premotor and prefrontal networks. We alsoobserved significant differences between the adolescents with high and low RPIscores in their general intelligence and the scores of positive youthdevelopment. We suggest that these morphological findings might reflectdifferences, between adolescents with high vs. low resistance to peer influences,in a repeated and concurrent engagement of these networks in social context.
 The audience effect refers to the phenomenon that ones performance on a task isaffected by the presence of others. Here we investigated how the audience effect modulates the neurocognitive signatures underlying peoples evaluation of theirown task performance/outcome. Participants in our study played a gambling game intwo social contexts: an "audience" condition and an "alone" condition. Thepresence of others modulated the feedback-related negativity (FRN), which mightreflect enhanced motivational significance or increased reward processing whenparticipants were watched compared to when they were alone. We also observedincreased P300 responses to outcome feedback in the audience condition,presumably reflecting more elaborative and sustained evaluation of outcomes inthe audience than alone context. This audience effect on the evaluative processescomplements previous observations on the social nature of outcome evaluation and extends a traditional topic in social psychology to the neuroscientific field.
 BACKGROUND: The functional localization of negativity bias, an influential index of emotion information processing, has yet to be identified. METHOD: Depressed(n=47) and healthy participants (n=58) completed a clinical interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders, symptom checklists, a behavioral task to measure negativitybias, and then viewed positive and negative images of social and nonsocial scenesduring an event-related fMRI task. Two subsamples of participants with high(i.e., 75%; n=26) and low (i.e., 25%; n=26) negativity bias scores were asincluded in subsequent analyses to examine neural differences. RESULTS: Depressedparticipants with a higher, relative to lower, negative bias showed significantlygreater neural activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus. CONCLUSION: Highnegativity bias evokes a distinctive pattern of brain activation in the frontalcortex of depressed participants. Increased activation occurred in the leftinferior frontal gyrus, related to Brodmann area 44, which is associated withlanguage and semantic processing, response inhibition, and cognitive reappraisal.This finding may reflect an abnormality in integrative emotional processingrather than processing of individual emotional dimensions in depressedparticipants with negativity bias.
 Valuation is a key tenet of decision neuroscience, where it is generally assumed that different attributes of competing options are assimilated into unitaryvalues. Such values are central to current neural models of choice. By contrast, psychological studies emphasize complex interactions between choice andvaluation. Principles of neuronal selection also suggest that competitiveinhibition may occur in early valuation stages, before option selection. We foundthat behavior in multi-attribute choice is best explained by a model involvingcompetition at multiple levels of representation. This hierarchical model alsoexplains neural signals in human brain regions previously linked to valuation,including striatum, parietal and prefrontal cortex, where activity representswithin-attribute competition, competition between attributes and optionselection. This multi-layered inhibition framework challenges the assumption thatoption values are computed before choice. Instead, our results suggest acanonical competition mechanism throughout all stages of a processing hierarchy, not simply at a final choice stage.
 BACKGROUND: The self-referential memory (SRM) effect refers to the phenomenonthat stimuli processed with reference to the self are better remembered thanthose referenced to others. Studies have shown that schizophrenia patients do nothave this memorial advantage for self-referenced information. The current studyinvestigated the electrophysiological mechanism of the abolished SRM effect inschizophrenia. METHOD: Twenty schizophrenia patients and 22 controls wererecruited to complete an SRM task. We used a high-time resolution event-relatedpotential (ERP) technique to analyze the electrophysiological differences betweenpatients and controls during self- and other-reflection processing. RESULTS:Behavior data indicated that healthy controls had a typical SRM bias that wasabsent in the schizophrenia patients. ERP comparison between groups showed thatthe schizophrenia patients presented smaller voltages in both self- andother-reflection conditions in the 160-260 ms (P2 component) and 800-1200 ms(positive slow wave) time windows over the pre/frontal cortex. Furthermore, theN2 amplitudes (270-380 ms) differed between self- and other-reflection conditionsin patients but not in normal controls. More importantly, we found that the P3amplitudes in the parietal cortex correlated significantly with the SRM biasscore in the patients (r = -0.688). CONCLUSIONS: These results providecomprehensive and direct electrophysiological evidence for self- andother-reflective dysfunction in schizophrenia patients and contribute to ourunderstanding of the underlying neural substrates of the abolished SRM effect in schizophrenia.
 BACKGROUND: Neurofunctional and behavioral abnormalities in facial emotionprocessing (FEmoP) have been consistently found in schizophrenia patients, butstudies assessing brain functioning in early phases are scarce and the variety ofexperimental paradigms in current literature make comparisons difficult. Thepresent work focuses on assessing FEmoP in people experiencing a psychoticepisode for the first time with different experimental paradigm approaches.METHODS: Twenty-two patients with a first psychotic episode (FPe) (13 males) tookpart in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study (1.5T) examining neuralresponses to explicit and implicit processing of fearful and happy facialexpressions presented at two different intensities: 50% and 100%. Their brainactivation was compared to that of 31 healthy subjects (15 males). RESULTS:Control subjects show differential patterns of brain activation regarding thetask demands (implicit or explicit processing), the emotional content (happy orfear) and the intensities of the emotion (50% or 100%); such differences are not found in participants with a first psychotic episode (FPe). No interaction orgroup effects are seen between control and FPe participants with any of theemotional tasks assessed, although FPe subjects show worse behavioralperformance. CONCLUSIONS: No brain areas recruited for FEmoP emerge assignificantly different between people with a FPe and healthy subjects,independently on the demands of the task, the emotion processed, or the intensityof the emotion; but FPe participants show a limited recruitment of differentialbrain regions that could be associated with poor emotional processing in theshort term. Our results outline the need of investigating the underlyingprocesses that lead FPe participants to worse FEmoP performance.
 Traditionally, the pathophysiology of cervical dystonia has been regarded mainly in relation to neurochemical abnormities in the basal ganglia. Recently, however,substantial evidence has emerged for cerebellar involvement. While the absence ofneurological "cerebellar signs" in most dystonia patients may be considered atleast provoking, there are more subtle indications of cerebellar dysfunction incomplex, demanding tasks. Specifically, given the role of the cerebellum in theneural representation of time, in the millisecond range, dysfunction to thisstructure is considered to be of greater importance than dysfunction of the basalganglia. In the current study, we investigated the performance of cervicaldystonia patients on a computer task known to engage the cerebellum, namely, the interception of a moving target with changing parameters (speed, acceleration,and angle) with a simple response (pushing a button). The cervical dystoniapatients achieved significantly worse results than a sample of healthy controls. Our results suggest that the cervical dystonia patients are impaired atintegrating incoming visual information with motor responses during theprediction of upcoming actions, an impairment we interpret as evidence ofcerebellar dysfunction.
 We address the issue of the relation between language and theory of mind (ToM)reasoning involving the understanding of others' mental states. In particular, wefocus on the evidence from people with aphasia and consider methodological issuesconcerning the nature of ToM tasks and test instructions. Research to date pointsto the independence of ToM from grammar in that studies of people with aphasiawho have profound grammatical impairment retain ToM reasoning. By contrast,difficulties shown by young children and by adults with right hemisphere braindamage on certain ToM tasks often appear to involve the absence of a pragmaticawareness that precludes the expression of ToM reasoning.
 Perception and execution of actions share a common representational and neuralsubstrate and thereby facilitate unintentional motor mimicry. Controllingautomatic imitation is therefore a crucial requirement of such a "sharedrepresentational" system. Based on previous findings from neuroimaging, wesuggest that resisting motor mimicry recruits the same underlying computationalmechanisms also involved in higher-level social cognitive processing, such asself - other differentiation and the representation of mental states. The aim of the present study was to investigate on a behavioral level whether there is afunctional association between the inhibition of imitation and tasks, assessingthe understanding of mental states and of different perspectives of self andother. In a sample of neuropsychological patients with frontal lesions, acorrelation between the ability for mental state attribution and the control ofimitation was found, with a similar effect in the control group. Temporo-parietallesioned patients showed a highly significant correlation between imitativecontrol and visual and cognitive perspective-taking. Even after controlling forexecutive functions, the results remained significant, indicating the functional specificity of this relationship. These findings provide new insight into thefunctional processes underlying the control of shared representations and suggesta novel link between embodied and higher-level social cognition.
 Non-verbal group dynamics are often opaque to a formal quantitative analysis ofcommunication flow. In this context, ensemble musicians can be a reliable modelof expert group coordination. In fact, bodily motion is a critical component ofinter-musician coordination and thus could be used as a valuable index ofsensorimotor communication. Here we measured head movement kinematics of anexpert quartet of musicians and, by applying Granger Causality analysis, wenumerically described the causality patterns between participants. We found aclear positive relationship between the amount of communication and complexity ofthe score segment. Furthermore, we also applied temporal and dynamical changes tothe musical score, known by the first violin only. The perturbations were devisedin order to force unidirectional communication between the leader of the quartet and the other participants. Results show that in these situations, unidirectionalinfluence from the leader decreased, thus implying that effective leadership may require prior sharing of information between participants. In conclusion, wecould measure the amount of information flow and sensorimotor group dynamicssuggesting that the fabric of leadership is not built upon exclusive information knowledge but rather on sharing it.
 OBJECTIVES: Patients with schizophrenia often suffer comorbid substance abuseregardless of gender. However, the vast majority of studies are only conducted inmale subjects. Therefore, the aim of these experiments is to assess addictivebehaviors of both sexes in a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia induced byprenatal methylazoxymethanol (MAM) acetate exposure. METHODS: MAM (22 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally on gestational day 17. Two studies were performed in the offspring: (1) an alcohol-drinking procedure to assess daily intake of 20%alcohol and relapse-like behavior after a period of forced abstinence; (2)Methamphetamine (METH) intravenous self administration (IVSA) followed by forced abstinence and reinstatement phases. RESULTS: MAM exposure during the prenatalperiod did not change alcohol drinking regardless of sex. However, MAM femalesshowed higher alcohol consumption in comparison to MAM males. The METH IVSA studyrevealed only a modest increase of drug consumption in MAM males, while there wasno difference between the female groups. Reinstatement data showed no effect ofthe MAM model in either sex, but suggested increased responding in female rats.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that female sex and schizophrenia-like phenotypemay work synergistically to enhance alcohol consumption. However, future researchis needed to establish paradigms in which these findings would be readilyassessed to test anti-addiction treatments.
 We introduce a new analytic technique for the microsegmentation of high-densityEEG to identify the discrete brain microstates evoked by the visual reversalcheckerboard task. To test the sensitivity of the present analytic approach todifferences in evoked brain microstates across experimental conditions, subjects were instructed to (a) passively view the reversals of the checkerboard (passive viewing condition), or (b) actively search for a target stimulus that may appear at the fixation point, and they were offered a monetary reward if they correctly detected the stimulus (active viewing condition). Results revealed that, withinthe first 168 ms of a checkerboard presentation, the same four brain microstates were evoked in the passive and active viewing conditions, whereas the brainmicrostates evoked after 168 ms differed between these two conditions, with more brain microstates elicited in the active than in the passive viewing condition.Additionally, distinctions were found in the active condition between a change ina scalp configuration that reflects a change in microstate and a change in scalp configuration that reflects a change in the level of activation of the samemicrostate. Finally, the bootstrapping procedure identified that two microstates lacked robustness even though statistical significance thresholds were met,suggesting these microstates should be replicated prior to placing weight ontheir generalizability across individuals. These results illustrate the utilityof the analytic approach and provide new information about the spatiotemporaldynamics of the brain states underlying passive and active viewing in the visual checkerboard task.
 BACKGROUND: The paper explored emotion comprehension in children with regard tofacial expression of emotion. The effect of valence and arousal evaluation, ofcontext and of psychophysiological measures was monitored. Indeed subjectiveevaluation of valence (positive vs. negative) and arousal (high vs. low), andcontextual (facial expression vs. facial expression and script) variables weresupposed to modulate the psychophysiological responses. METHODS: Self-reportmeasures (in terms of correct recognition, arousal and valence attribution) andpsychophysiological correlates (facial electromyography, EMG, skin conductanceresponse, SCR, and heart rate, HR) were observed when children (N = 26; mean age = 8.75 y; range 6-11 y) looked at six facial expressions of emotions (happiness, anger, fear, sadness, surprise, and disgust) and six emotional scripts(contextualized facial expressions). The competencies about the recognition, the evaluation on valence and arousal was tested in concomitance withpsychophysiological variations. Specifically, we tested for the congruence ofthese multiple measures. RESULTS: Log-linear analysis and repeated measure ANOVAsshowed different representations across the subjects, as a function of emotion.Specifically, children' recognition and attribution were well developed for some emotions (such as anger, fear, surprise and happiness), whereas some otheremotions (mainly disgust and sadness) were less clearly represented. SCR, HR and EMG measures were modulated by the evaluation based on valence and arousal, with increased psychophysiological values mainly in response to anger, fear andhappiness. CONCLUSIONS: As shown by multiple regression analysis, a significantconsonance was found between self-report measures and psychophysiologicalbehavior, mainly for emotions rated as more arousing and negative in valence. Themultilevel measures were discussed at light of dimensional attribution model.
 Despite significant social difficulties, children with autism spectrum disorder(ASD) are vulnerable to the effects of social exclusion. We recorded EEG whilechildren with ASD and typical peers played a computerized game involving peerrejection. Children with ASD reported ostracism-related distress comparable totypically developing children. Event-related potentials (ERPs) indicated adistinct pattern of temporal processing of rejection events in children with ASD.While typically developing children showed enhanced response to rejection at alate slow wave indexing emotional arousal and regulation, those with autismshowed attenuation at an early component, suggesting reduced engagement ofattentional resources in the aversive social context. Results emphasize theimportance of studying the time course of social information processing in ASD;they suggest distinct mechanisms subserving similar overt behavior and yieldinsights relevant to development and implementation of targeted treatmentapproaches and objective measures of response to treatment.
 Aberrant eye gaze mechanisms have been implicated in autism spectrum disorders(ASD). Studies of eye movements in children with ASD reveal diminished eye gazeduration and lack of specific eye gaze fixation to the eyes and/or mouth comparedwith controls. However, findings to date have been contradictory. We examinedeye-tracking studies on face processing in children with ASD and conductedmeta-analyses to examine whether these children demonstrate atypical fixation on primary facial regions. Twenty eye-tracking studies in children with ASD werereviewed, of which the results from 14 studies were incorporated in themeta-analyses that evaluated fixation duration on (i) eyes (eight studies) and(ii) mouth (six studies). The results reveal that children with ASD havesignificantly reduced gaze fixation to the eye region of faces. The results ofthe meta-analyses indicate that ASD patients have significant impairments in gazefixation to the eyes. On the other hand, no significant difference was uncovered in terms of fixation to the mouth region; however, this finding needs to beinterpreted with caution because of the significant heterogeneity in the mouthfixation studies. The findings of this meta-analysis add further clarity to anexpanding literature and suggest that specific eye gaze fixation to the eyeregion may represent a robust biomarker for the condition. The heterogeneityassociated with the mouth fixation data precludes any definitive statement as to the robustness of these findings.
 The frequent interaction and synergy between sexual arousal and sexual desireoccuring during a sexual experience explains the difficulty in disentagling thesetwo phenomena in the human sexual response. Sexual desire is defined as agoal-directed motivational state integrating the other in one's personal sphereon the basis of intentionality, rather than by instinct only. Sexual arousalincludes physical manifestations and subjective perception of excitement.Interest in sexual arousal has engendered a growing body of research concerningits nature and function as well as the biological basis of the mechanismssustaining it. Recent functional imaging has played a key role in seeking toisolate brain regions specific to sexual arousal. This field may represent a new challenge for social neuroscience.
 New single-cell recordings show that humans do have mirror neurons, and in morebrain regions than previously suspected. Some action-execution neurons were seen to be inhibited during observation, possibly preventing imitation and helpingself/other discrimination.
 Social and biological explanations traditionally have been cast as incompatible, but advances in recent years have revealed a new view synthesized from these 2very different levels of analysis. The authors review evidence underscoring thecomplementing nature of social and biological levels of analysis and how the 2together can foster understanding of the mechanisms underlying complex behaviorand the mind. Specifically, they review the utility of considering socialinfluences on biological processes that are often viewed as outside the socialdomain including genetic constitution, gene expression, disease, and autonomic,neuroendocrine, and immune activity. This research underscores the unity ofpsychology and the importance of retaining multilevel integrative research thatspans molar and molecular levels of analysis. Especially needed in the comingyears is more research on the mechanisms linking social and biological events andprocesses.
 The personal/impersonal distinction of moral decision-making postulates intuitiveemotional responses from medial frontal activity and rational evaluation fromlateral frontal activity. This model can be analyzed in behavioral variantfrontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), a disorder characterized by impaired emotionalintuitions, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) involvement, and relativesparing of lateral frontal regions. Moral dilemmas were presented to 10 bvFTD, 11Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 9 healthy control (HC) participants while recordingskin conductance responses, a measure of emotional arousal. We evaluated theirpersonal versus impersonal conflict, subjective discomfort, and adherence tosocial norms. Replicating prior work, bvFTD participants were more willing toharm in the personal, but not the impersonal, dilemma compared to AD and HCgroups. BvFTD participants had lower arousal and less of an increase in conflict on the personal versus the impersonal dilemma, in contrast to increased arousaland conflict for the AD and HC groups. Furthermore, bvFTD participants verbalizedless discomfort, a correlate of low adherence to social norms. These findingssupport impaired emotional reactions to moral dilemmas in bvFTD and vmPFC lesionsand the personal/impersonal model. It suggests a reversion to utilitarian-likeconsiderations when emotional intuition is impaired in the brain.
 People feel psychological pain when they are excluded, and this pain is oftenattenuated when emotional support is received. It is therefore likely that aspecific neural mechanism underlies the detection of social exclusion. Similarly,specific neural mechanisms may underlie the beneficial effects of emotionalsupport. Although neuroimaging researchers have recently examined the neuralbasis of social pain, there is presently no agreement as to which part of theanterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is involved in the perception and modulation ofsocial pain. We hypothesized that activity in those brain regions that areassociated with social pain would be correlated with decrements in social paininduced by emotional support. To examine the effects of emotional support onsocial pain caused by exclusion, we conducted an fMRI study in which participantsplayed a virtual ball-tossing game. Participants were initially included andlater excluded from the game. In the latter half of the session from whichparticipants were excluded, participants received emotionally supportive textmessages. We found that emotional support led to increased activity in the leftlateral/medial prefrontal cortices and some temporal regions. Those individualswho experienced greater attenuation of social pain exhibited lower ventral ACCand higher left lateral prefrontal cortex activation. These results suggest that the ventral ACC underlies social pain, and that emotional support enhancesprefrontal cortex activity, which in turn may lead to a weakened affectiveresponse.
 Music is a natural human expression present in all cultures, but the functions itserves are still debated. Previous research indicates that rhythm, an essentialfeature of music, can enhance coordination of movement and increase socialbonding. However, the prolonged effects of rhythm have not yet been investigated.In this study, pairs of participants were exposed to one of three kinds ofauditory stimuli (rhythmic, arrhythmic, or white-noise) and subsequently engaged in five trials of a joint-action task demanding interpersonal coordination. Weshow that when compared with the other two stimuli, exposure to the rhythmic beatreduced the practice effect in task performance. Analysis of the behavioral data suggests that this reduction results from more temporally coupled motor movementsover successive trials and that shared exposure to rhythm facilitatesinterpersonal motor coupling, which in this context serves to impede theattainment of necessary dynamic coordination. We propose that rhythm has thepotential to enhance interpersonal motor coupling, which might serve as amechanism behind its facilitation of positive social attitudes.
 In our daily lives, we constantly engage in reciprocal interactions with otherindividuals and represent ourselves in the context of our surrounding socialworld. Within social interactions, humans often experience interpersonal emotionssuch as embarrassment, shame, guilt, or pride. How interpersonal emotions areprocessed on the neural systems level is of major interest for socialneuroscience research. While the configuration of laboratory settings in general is constraining for emotion research, recent neuroimaging investigations came up with new approaches to implement socially interactive and immersive scenarios forthe real-life investigation of interpersonal emotions. These studies could showthat among other brain regions the so-called mentalizing network, which istypically involved when we represent and make sense of others' states of mind, isassociated with interpersonal emotions. The anterior insula/anterior cingulatecortex network at the same time processes one's own bodily arousal during suchinterpersonal emotional experiences. Current research aimed to explore how wemake sense of others' emotional states during social interactions andinvestigates the modulating factors of our emotional experiences during socialinteractions. Understanding how interpersonal emotions are processed on theneural systems level may yield significant implications for neuropsychiatricdisorders that affect social behavior such as social anxiety disorders or autism.
 The present study is the first to investigate the relationship between vagal tonelevel and event-related potentials (ERPs) in adults. Numerous studies have shown a relationship between vagal tone and the individual differences between avariety of psychophysiological, affective, and social outcomes. This suggeststhat vagal tone can be related to how people process relevant affective socialinformation at the brain level. This study aimed to assess whether the ERPresponse varies between high and low vagal tone groups, in the face of salientaffective information. In the experimental cohort, two groups were separatedaccording to their vagal tone level. ERPs were recorded while individualsperformed an affective picture task that included positive, neutral, and negativeemotional stimuli. Differences between the high and low vagal tone groups wereobserved at the early posterior negativity for both positive and negativevalences, and at the late positive potential for all the categories. It can beconcluded that differences between high and low vagal tone levels are related to differences in the ERPs at early, middle, and late latencies. The results arediscussed with respect to the effect of differences between the vagal toneconditions on various stages of information-processing.
 Evidence suggests that mind wandering is a frequent accompaniment to an unhappymood. Building on such work, two laboratory experiments used mood induction toassess whether the greater frequency of mind wandering in a low mood is alsoaccompanied by a shift towards a focus on events from the past. Experiment 1induced moods via video and induction of an unhappy mood was associated with agreater tendency for past-related mind wandering as measured by a post-taskquestionnaire. In Experiment 2, negative and positive moods were induced in agroup of participants using the Velten mood-induction procedure and the temporal focus of mind wandering was measured using experience sampling probes. Analysesindicated that induction of an unhappy mood led to an increase in past-relatedmind wandering and the magnitude of this change increased with scores on ameasure of depressive symptoms. Together these experiments suggest that when the mind wanders in an unhappy mood it is drawn to events from its past.
 Chronometric properties of theory of mind and intentions understanding morespecifically are well documented. Notably, it was demonstrated usingmagnetoencephalography that the brain regions involved were recruited as soon as 200 ms post-stimulus. We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to characterize an electrophysiological marker of attribution of intentions. We also explored therobustness of this ERP signature under two conditions corresponding to eitherexplicit instructions to focus on others' intentions or implicit instructionswith no reference to mental states. Two matched groups of 16 healthy volunteerseach received either explicit or no instructions about intentions and performed anonverbal attribution of intentions task based on sequential four-image comicstrips depicting either intentional or physical causality. A bilateral posterior positive component, ranging from 250 to 650 ms post-stimulus, showed greateramplitude in intentional than in physical condition (the intention ERP effect).This effect occurs during the third image only, suggesting that it reflects theintegration of information depicted in the third image to the contextual cuesgiven by the first two. The intention effect was similar in the two groups ofsubjects. Overall, our results identify a clear ERP marker of the first hundreds of milliseconds of intentions processing probably related to a contextualintegrative mechanism and suggest its robustness by showing its blindness to taskdemands manipulation.
 Several neuroimaging studies have revealed that the superior temporal sulcus(STS) is highly implicated in the processing of facial motion. A limitation ofthese investigations, however, is that many of them utilize unnatural stimuli(e.g., morphed videos) or those which contain many confounding spatial cues. As aresult, the underlying mechanisms may not be fully engaged during suchperception. The aim of the current study was to build upon the existingliterature by implementing highly detailed and accurate models of facialmovement. Accordingly, neurologically healthy participants viewed simultaneoussequences of rigid and nonrigid motion that was retargeted onto a standardcomputer generated imagery face model. Their task was to discriminate betweendifferent facial motion videos in a two-alternative forced choice paradigm.Presentations varied between upright and inverted orientations. In corroboration with previous data, the perception of natural facial motion strongly activated a portion of the posterior STS. The analysis also revealed engagement of thelingual gyrus, fusiform gyrus, precentral gyrus, and cerebellum. These findingstherefore suggest that the processing of dynamic facial information is supported by a network of visuomotor substrates.
 Recent years have witnessed a paradigm shift in the study and conceptualizationof epilepsy, which is increasingly understood as a network-level disorder. Anemblematic case is temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common drug-resistantepilepsy that is electroclinically defined as a focal epilepsy and pathologicallyassociated with hippocampal sclerosis. In this review, we will summarizehistopathological, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging evidence supporting theconcept that the substrate of TLE is not limited to the hippocampus alone, butrather is broadly distributed across multiple brain regions and interconnectingwhite matter pathways. We will introduce basic concepts of graph theory, aformalism to quantify topological properties of complex systems that has recentlybeen widely applied to study networks derived from brain imaging andelectrophysiology. We will discuss converging graph theoretical evidenceindicating that networks in TLE show marked shifts in their overall topology,providing insight into the neurobiology of TLE as a network-level disorder. Ourreview will conclude by discussing methodological challenges and future clinical applications of this powerful analytical approach.
 Although Theory of Mind (ToM) is thought to be impaired in Alzheimer's disease(AD), it remains unclear whether this impairment is linked to the level of taskcomplexity, the heterogeneity of the studied patients, or the implication ofexecutive dysfunctions. To elucidate this point, 42 AD patients, divided into twosubgroups [moderate AD (mAD) patients (n = 19) and early AD (eAD) patients (n =23)], and 23 matched healthy older subjects (HO) were enrolled. All participants were given (1) a false-belief task (cognitive ToM), (2) a revised version of the "Reading the Mind in the Eyes" test (affective ToM), and (3) a composite taskdesigned to assess ToM abilities with minimal cognitive demands. Participantswere also given executive tasks assessing inhibition, shifting, and updatingprocesses. We observed a significant impairment of cognitive and composite ToMabilities in eAD patients compared with mAD patients. There was no impairment of affective ToM. Stepwise regression revealed that measures of global efficiencyand executive functions (EFs) were the best predictors of progressive decay ofToM scores. These results indicate that cognitive aspects of ToM are moresensitive to AD progression than affective tasks. They also show that ToMabilities are more affected by dementia severity than by task complexity. Oneexplanation of our results is the presence of compensatory mechanisms (socialreserve) in AD.
 Accurate distinction between self and other representations is fundamental to arange of social cognitive capacities, and understanding individual differences inthis ability is an important aim for psychological research. This demandsaccurate measures of self-other distinction (SOD). The present study examined an experimental paradigm employed frequently to measure SOD in the action domain;specifically, we evaluated the rotated finger-action stimuli used increasingly tomeasure automatic imitation (AI). To assess the suitability of these stimuli, we compared AI elicited by different action stimuli to the performance on aperspective-taking task believed to measure SOD in the perception domain. In two separate experiments we reveal three important findings: firstly, we demonstrate a strong confounding influence of orthogonal-compatibility effects on AI elicitedby certain rotated stimuli. Second, we demonstrate the potential for thisconfounding influence to mask important relationships between AI and othermeasures of SOD; we observed a relationship between AI and perspective-takingperformance only when the former was measured in isolation of orthogonalitycompatibility. Thirdly, we observed a relationship between these two performance measures only in a sub-group of individuals exhibiting a pure form of AI.Furthermore, this relationship revealed a self-bias in SOD-reduced AI wasassociated with increased egocentric misattributions in perspective taking.Together, our findings identify an important methodological consideration formeasures of AI and extend previous research by showing an egocentric style of SODacross action and perception domains.
 Turner syndrome is a genetic condition resulting from the partial or completeabsence of an X-chromosome in phenotypic females. Individuals with Turnersyndrome often display social difficulties that are reminiscent of thoseassociated with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), conditions associated withempathy and mirror-neuron system (MNS) deficits. The goal of the present studywas (1) to investigate the extent to which adults with Turner syndrome displayautistic and empathic traits, and (2) to probe the integrity of the MNS in thisneurogenetic disorder. Sixteen individuals with Turner syndrome and 16 age-,sex-, and IQ-matched controls took part in a neuropsychological assessment where the Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, the Autism Spectrum Quotient and the Empathy Quotient were administered. Functioning of the MNS was assessed bymeasuring motor cortex activity with transcranial magnetic stimulation during an action-observation task. Results show that individuals with Turner syndrome donot differ significantly from controls regarding autistic or empathic traits, andpresent normal functioning of the MNS during action observation. Correlationalanalysis showed a significant positive relationship between scores on the EmpathyQuotient and motor facilitation during action observation, bringing furthersupport to the hypothesis that MNS activity is related to sociocognitivecompetence.
 The present research explored the main factors that can influence subjects'choices in the case of decisions. In order to elucidate the individualdifferences that influence the decisional processes, making their strategies moreor less advantageous, we tested the effect of a reward sensitivity in thebehavioral activation system (BAS-Reward) constructed on the ability todistinguish between high- and low-risk decisions. Secondly, the lateralizationeffect, related to increased activation of the left (BAS-related) hemisphere, wasexplored. Thirty-one subjects were tested using the Iowa Gambling Task, and theBAS-Reward measure was applied to distinguish between high-BAS and low-BASgroups. Behavioral responses (gain/loss options) and alpha-band modulation wereconsidered. It was found that high-BAS group increased their tendency to opt infavor of the immediate reward (loss strategy) rather than the long-term option(win strategy). Secondly, high-BAS subjects showed an increased left-hemisphereactivation in response to losing (with immediate reward) choices in comparisonwith low-BAS subjects. A "reward bias" effect was supposed to explain both thebad strategy and the unbalanced hemispheric activation for high-BAS and morerisk-taking subjects.
 Social behavior is often shaped by the rich storehouse of biographicalinformation that we hold for other people. In our daily life, we rapidly andflexibly retrieve a host of biographical details about individuals in our social network, which often guide our decisions as we navigate complex socialinteractions. Even abstract traits associated with an individual, such as theirpolitical affiliation, can cue a rich cascade of person-specific knowledge. Here,we asked whether the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) serves as a hub for adistributed neural circuit that represents person knowledge. Fifty participantsacross two studies learned biographical information about fictitious people in a 2-d training paradigm. On day 3, they retrieved this biographical informationwhile undergoing an fMRI scan. A series of multivariate and connectivity analysessuggest that the ATL stores abstract person identity representations. Moreover,this region coordinates interactions with a distributed network to support theflexible retrieval of person attributes. Together, our results suggest that theATL is a central hub for representing and retrieving person knowledge.
 Schilbach et al. contribute to neuroscience methodology through drawing oninsights from the second-person approach. We suggest that they could furthercontribute to social neuroscience by more fully spelling out the ways in which a second-person approach to the nature and origin of thinking could transformneuroscience.
 The past two decades have witnessed tremendous advances in noninvasive andpostmortem neuroscientific techniques, advances that have made it possible, forthe first time, to compare in detail the organization of the human brain to that of other primates. Studies comparing humans to chimpanzees and other great apesreveal that human brain evolution was not merely a matter of enlargement, butinvolved changes at all levels of organization that have been examined. Theseinclude the cellular and laminar organization of cortical areas; the higher orderorganization of the cortex, as reflected in the expansion of association cortex(in absolute terms, as well as relative to primary areas); the distribution oflong-distance cortical connections; and hemispheric asymmetry. Additionally,genetic differences between humans and other primates have proven to be moreextensive than previously thought, raising the possibility that human brainevolution involved significant modifications of neurophysiology and cerebralenergy metabolism.
 One of the major contributions of recent personality psychology is the findingthat traits are related to each other in an organized hierarchy. To date,however, researchers have yet to investigate this hierarchy in nonhuman primates.Such investigations are critical in confirming the cross-species nature of trait personality helping to illuminate personality as neurobiologically-based andevolutionarily-derived dimensions of primate disposition. Investigations ofpotential genetic polymorphisms associated with hierarchical models ofpersonality among nonhuman primates represent a critical first step. The current study examined the hierarchical structure of chimpanzee personality as well assex-specific associations with a polymorphism in the promoter region of thevasopressin V1a receptor gene (AVPR1A), a gene associated with dispositionaltraits, among 174 chimpanzees. Results confirmed a hierarchical structure ofpersonality across species and, despite differences in early rearing experiences,suggest a sexually dimorphic role of AVPR1A polymorphisms on hierarchicalpersonality profiles at a higher-order level.
 People react aversely when faced with unfair situations, a phenomenon that hasbeen related to an electroencephalographic (EEG) potential known as medialfrontal negativity (MFN). To our knowledge, the existence of the MFN in children has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we recorded EEG activity from 15 childrenplaying the ultimatum game (UG) and who afterward performed a recognition task,in order to assess whether they could recognize the unfair and fair (familiar)proposers among unfamiliar faces. During the recognition task, we also acquiredpupil dilation data to investigate subconscious recognition processes. A typical (adult-like) MFN component was detected in reaction to unfair proposals. We founda positive correlation between reaction time and empathy, as well as a negativecorrelation between reaction time and systematic reasoning scores. Finally, wedetected a significant difference in pupil dilation in response to unfamiliarfaces versus UG proposers. Our data provide the first evidence of MFN inchildren, which appears to index similar neurophysiological phenomena as inadults. Also, reaction time to fair proposals seems to be related to individualtraits, as represented by empathy and systematizing. Our pupil dilation dataprovide evidence that automatic responses to faces did not index fairness, butfamiliarity. These findings have implications for our understanding of socialdevelopment in typically developing children.
 INTRODUCTION: Although diet has a substantial influence on the aging brain, therelationship between biomarkers of diet and aspects of brain health remainsunclear. This study examines the neural mechanisms that mediate the relationship between omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (O3PUFAs) and executive functions in at-risk (APOE e4 carriers), cognitively intact older adults. We hypothesized thathigher levels of O3PUFAs are associated with better performance in a particularcomponent of the executive functions, namely cognitive flexibility, and that thisrelationship is mediated by gray matter volume of a specific region thought to beimportant for cognitive flexibility, the anterior cingulate cortex. METHODS: Weexamined 40 cognitively intact adults between the ages of 65 and 75 with the APOEe4 polymorphism to investigate the relationship between biomarkers of O3PUFAs,tests of cognitive flexibility (measured by the Delis-Kaplan Executive FunctionSystem Trail Making Test), and gray matter volume within regions of theprefrontal cortex (PFC). RESULTS: A mediation analysis revealed that gray matter volume within the left rostral anterior cingulate cortex partially mediates therelationship between O3PUFA biomarkers and cognitive flexibility. CONCLUSION:These results suggest that the anterior cingulate cortex acts as a mediator ofthe relationship between O3PUFAs and cognitive flexibility in cognitively intact adults thought to be at risk for cognitive decline. Through their link toexecutive functions and neuronal measures of PFC volume, O3PUFAs show potentialas a nutritional therapy to prevent dysfunction in the aging brain.
 Spontaneous social coordination has been extensively described in naturalsettings but so far no controlled methodological approaches have been employedthat systematically advance investigations into the possible self-organizednature of bond formation and dissolution between humans. We hypothesized that,under certain contexts, spontaneous synchrony-a well-described phenomenon inbiological and physical settings-could emerge spontaneously between humans as aresult of information exchange. Here, a new way to quantify interpersonalinteractions in real time is proposed. In a simple experimental paradigm, pairsof participants facing each other were required to actively produce actions,while provided (or not) with the vision of similar actions being performed bysomeone else. New indices of interpersonal coordination, inspired by thetheoretical framework of coordination dynamics (based on relative phase andfrequency overlap between movements of individuals forming a pair) were developedand used. Results revealed that spontaneous phase synchrony (i.e., unintentional in-phase coordinated behavior) between two people emerges as soon as theyexchange visual information, even if they are not explicitly instructed tocoordinate with each other. Using the same tools, we also quantified the degreeto which the behavior of each individual remained influenced by the socialencounter even after information exchange had been removed, apparently a kind of social memory.
 Understanding how neural processes involved in punishing and rewarding others arealtered by group membership and personality traits is critical in order to gain abetter understanding of how socially important phenomena such as racial and groupbiases develop. Participants in an fMRI study (n = 48) gave rewards (money) orpunishments (electroshocks) to in-group or out-group members. The results showthat when participants rewarded others, greater activation was found in regionstypically associated with receiving rewards such as the striatum and medialorbitofrontal cortex, bilaterally. Activation in those regions increased whenparticipants rewarded in-group compared to out-group members. Punishment led toincreased activation in regions typically associated with Theory of Mindincluding the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior superior temporal sulcus, aswell as regions typically associated with perceiving others in pain such as thedorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula and lateral orbitofrontalcortex. Interestingly, in contrast to the findings regarding reward, activity in these regions was not moderated by whether the target of the punishment was anin- or out-group member. Additional regression analysis revealed thatparticipants who have low perspective taking skills and higher levels ofpsychopathy showed less activation in the brain regions identified when punishingothers, especially when they were out-group members. In sum, when an individualis personally responsible for delivering rewards and punishments to others,in-group bias is stronger for reward allocation than punishments, marking thefirst neuroscientific evidence of this dissociation.
 The behaviors of other people are often central to envisioning the future. Theability to accurately predict the thoughts and actions of others is essential forsuccessful social interactions, with far-reaching consequences. Despite itsimportance, little is known about how the brain represents people in order topredict behavior. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study,participants learned the unique personality of 4 protagonists and imagined howeach would behave in different scenarios. The protagonists' personalities werecomposed of 2 traits: Agreeableness and Extraversion. Which protagonist was beingimagined was accurately inferred based solely on activity patterns in the medial prefrontal cortex using multivariate pattern classification, providing novelevidence that brain activity can reveal whom someone is thinking about. Lateraltemporal and posterior cingulate cortex discriminated between different degreesof agreeableness and extraversion, respectively. Functional connectivity analysisconfirmed that regions associated with trait-processing and individual identitieswere functionally coupled. Activity during the imagination task, and revealed by functional connectivity, was consistent with the default network. Our resultssuggest that distinct regions code for personality traits, and that the braincombines these traits to represent individuals. The brain then uses this"personality model" to predict the behavior of others in novel situations.
 Mounting neurophysiological evidence indicates that the visual analysis of human movement differs from the visual analysis of other categories of complexmovement. If different patterns of neural activity underlie visual percepts ofhuman and nonhuman movement, then psychophysical measures should elucidatedifferent patterns of visual sensitivity to human movement and similarly complex,but nonhuman movement. To test this prediction, two psychophysical studiescompared visual sensitivity to human and animal motions. Using a simultaneousmasking paradigm, observers performed a coherent motion detection task withpoint-light displays of human and horse gait, presented upright and inverted.While task performance indicated the use of configural processing during thedetection of both human and horse motion, observers demonstrated greater visualsensitivity to coherent human motion than coherent horse motion. Recentexperience influenced orientation dependence for both types of motion. Togetherwith previous neurophysiological findings, these psychophysical results suggestthat the visual perception of human movement is both distinct from and sharescommonalities with the visual perception of similarly complex, nonhuman movement.
 Impaired attentional processing of negative facial expressions is prominent inschizophrenia and has been shown to be associated with patients' socialdysfunctions. However, little is known about when and which specific attentiondeficits influence social functions. Given the dynamic feature of attention, itis necessary to investigate the attention deficits in negative emotionalprocessing unfolding in time. The current study used event-related potentials(ERPs) to investigate the temporal dynamics of attention deficits in emotionperception and their potential relationship with emotional/social impairments in neuroleptic naive schizophrenic patients. Two specific attention deficits wereidentified and were found to be associated with emotional/social impairments.More specifically, the deficit in orienting attention (evidenced with the reducedP1 amplitude) was correlated with expressive deficits, while the deficit inexecutive control of attention (evidenced with the reduced P3 amplitude) wascorrelated with avolition/asociality. Together, these findings may provide novel insights into the core pathophysiological processes and offer objectivebiomarkers for specific emotional/social impairments in schizophrenia. It is alsohoped that this study helps to bridge the gap between basic cognitive deficitsand relative high-level social dysfunctions in schizophrenic patients.
 Although significant advances have been made in our understanding of the neuralbasis of action observation and intention understanding in the last few decadesby studies demonstrating the involvement of a specific brain network (actionobservation network; AON), these have been largely based on experimental studies in which people have been considered as strictly isolated entities. However, we, as social species, spend much more of our time performing actions interactingwith others. Research shows that a person's position along the continuum ofperceived social isolation/bonding to others is associated with a variety ofphysical and mental health effects. Thus, there is a crucial need to betterunderstand the neural basis of intention understanding performed in interpersonaland emotional contexts. To address this issue, we performed a meta-analysis usingof functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies over the past decade thatexamined brain and cortical network processing associated with understanding the intention of others actions vs. those associated with passionate love for others.Both overlapping and distinct cortical and subcortical regions were identifiedfor intention and love, respectively. These findings provide scientists andclinicians with a set of brain regions that can be targeted for futureneuroscientific studies on intention understanding, and help developneurocognitive models of pair-bonding.
 As humans we are a highly social species: in order to coordinate our jointactions and assure successful communication, we use language skills to explicitlyconvey information to each other, and social abilities such as empathy orperspective taking to infer another person's emotions and mental state. The humancognitive capacity to draw inferences about other peoples' beliefs, intentionsand thoughts has been termed mentalizing, theory of mind or cognitive perspectivetaking. This capacity makes it possible, for instance, to understand that people may have views that differ from our own. Conversely, the capacity to share thefeelings of others is called empathy. Empathy makes it possible to resonate with others' positive and negative feelings alike--we can thus feel happy when wevicariously share the joy of others and we can share the experience of suffering when we empathize with someone in pain. Importantly, in empathy one feels withsomeone, but one does not confuse oneself with the other; that is, one stillknows that the emotion one resonates with is the emotion of another. If thisself-other distinction is not present, we speak of emotion contagion, a precursorof empathy that is already present in babies.
 Isolating processes within the brain that are specific to human behavior is a keygoal for social neuroscience. The current research was an attempt to test whetherrecent findings of enhanced negative ERPs in response to unexpected human gazeare unique to eye gaze stimuli by comparing the effects of gaze cues with theeffects of an arrow cue. ERPs were recorded while participants (N = 30) observed a virtual actor or an arrow that gazed (or pointed) either toward (objectcongruent) or away from (object incongruent) a flashing checkerboard. An enhancednegative ERP (N300) in response to object incongruent compared to objectcongruent trials was recorded for both eye gaze and arrow stimuli. The findingsare interpreted as reflecting a domain general mechanism for detecting unexpectedevents.
 It has been long recognized that parents exert profound influences on childdevelopment. Dating back to at least the seventeenth-century Enlightenment, theability for parents to shape child behavior in an enduring way has been noted.Twentieth-century scholars developed theories to explain how parenting histories influence psychological development, and since that time, the number ofscientific publications on parenting influences in both human and nonhuman animalfields has grown at an exponential rate, reaching numbers in the thousands by2015. This special issue describes a symposium delivered by Megan Gunnar, Regina Sullivan, Mar Sanchez, and Nim Tottenham in the Fall of 2014 at the Society forSocial Neuroscience. The goal of the symposium was to describe the emergingknowledge on neurobiological mechanisms that mediate parent-offspringinteractions across three different species: rodent, monkey, and human. The talkswere aimed at designing testable models of parenting effects on the developmentof emotional and stress regulation. Specifically, the symposium aimed atcharacterizing the special modulatory (buffering) effects of parental cues onfear- and stress-relevant neurobiology and behaviors of the offspring and todiscuss examples of impaired buffering when the parent-infant relationship isdisrupted.
 Empathy is defined as an individually varying but stable personality trait. Toour knowledge this notion seems questionable considering recent studies provingneuronal plasticity not only in childhood and adolescence but over the wholelifespan. We propose a model in which an individual's basic empathicabilities-arising from genetic factors, brain maturation, and early attachmentexperiences -are continually modulated by the intensity, continuity, andfrequency of interpersonal socio-emotional stimulation and challenges. We assume neural processes and their underlying neural structures being modified by social and socio-emotional stimulation. Continuous social interactions should producenoticeable effects on the empathic abilities of an individual independent of age or brain maturation level. In particular, empathic abilities should be learnable and expandable beyond specific developmental windows. To elucidate thishypothesis we surveyed empathy measures of students of various professions withthe help of a new instrument, the Questionnaire of Cognitive and AffectiveEmpathy (QCAE) categorizing them into three different groups depending on theirsubsequent occupational fields: medical students, students of academic socialprofessions, and a control group. Results indicate that continuoussocio-emotional stimulation could increase empathic abilities potentially leadingto learning effects.
 Human facial expressions can be recognized rapidly and effortlessly. However, forintense emotions from real life, positive and negative facial expressions aredifficult to discriminate and the judgment of facial expressions is biasedtowards simultaneously perceived body expressions. This study employedevent-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the neural dynamics involved inthe integration of emotional signals from facial and body expressions of victory and defeat. Emotional expressions of professional players were used to createpictures of face-body compounds, with either matched or mismatched emotionalexpressions in faces and bodies. Behavioral results showed that congruentemotional information of face and body facilitated the recognition of facialexpressions. ERP data revealed larger P1 amplitudes for incongruent compared tocongruent stimuli. Also, a main effect of body valence on the P1 was observed,with enhanced amplitudes for the stimuli with losing compared to winning bodies. The main effect of body expression was also observed in N170 and N2, with winningbodies producing larger N170/N2 amplitudes. In the later stage, a significantinteraction of congruence by body valence was found on the P3 component. Winning bodies elicited lager P3 amplitudes than losing bodies did when face and bodyconveyed congruent emotional signals. Beyond the knowledge based on prototypical facial and body expressions, the results of this study facilitate us tounderstand the complexity of emotion evaluation and categorization out oflaboratory.
 The capacity to self-generate mental content that is unrelated to the currentenvironment is a fundamental characteristic of the mind, and the currentexperiment explored how this experience is related to the decisions that peoplemake in daily life. We examined how task-unrelated thought (TUT) varies with the length of time participants are willing to wait for an economic reward, asmeasured using an inter-temporal discounting task. When participants performed a task requiring minimal attention, the greater the amount of time spent engaged inTUT the longer the individual was prepared to wait for an economic reward. These data indicate that self-generated thought engages processes associated with thesuccessful management of long-term goals. Although immersion in the here and now is undeniably advantageous, under appropriate conditions the capacity to let goof the present and consider more pertinent personal goals may have its ownrewards.
 A forced-choice social foraging method was used to explore how free-rangingrhesus monkeys make inferences about other individuals' goals and intentions.Subjects saw an experimenter perform an action towards one of two potential food sources, then were allowed to approach and choose one of those sources. Resultsshowed that subjects selectively picked the food source targeted by theexperimenter's action only when the action was within the rhesus' motorrepertoire. Further studies explored the extent to which rhesus attend to thedetails of the goal as well as the means by which the goal was obtained, withresults paralleling those obtained from cellular recordings of macaque mirrorneurons. Monkeys' pattern of success and failure supports the hypothesis thatmotor areas play a functionally significant role in event parsing and actionunderstanding.
 Individuals with schizophrenia exhibit impaired social cognition, which manifestsas difficulties in identifying emotions, feeing connected to others, inferringpeople's thoughts and reacting emotionally to others. These social cognitiveimpairments interfere with social connections and are strong determinants of the degree of impaired daily functioning in such individuals. Here, we review recent findings from the fields of social cognition and social neuroscience and identifythe social processes that are impaired in schizophrenia. We also consider empathyas an example of a complex social cognitive function that integrates severalsocial processes and is impaired in schizophrenia. This information may guideinterventions to improve social cognition in patients with this disorder.
 I discuss the emergence of a science of emotion and argue that research in thisdomain requires an appreciation of the organization of emotional processes atdifferent levels as postulated by social neuroscience. Emotions cannot beunderstood without relying on a program of multidisciplinary research. Localmultidisciplinarity cannot be achieved without a programmatic framework thattakes three issues into account (1) the relationship of multiple levels ofemotions and connected processes, (2) the mutually informative study of humans,animals, and artificial systems, and (3) the dynamic nature of emotions in adynamic systems approach. Illustrations for my arguments are provided relating tofacial expressions of humans.
 This fMRI study analyzes inferences on other persons' traits, whereby half of theparticipants were given spontaneous ("read") instructions while the other halfwere given intentional ("infer the person's trait") instructions. Severalsentences described the behavior of a target person from which a strong traitcould be inferred (trait diagnostic) or not (trait nondiagnostic). A directcontrast between spontaneous and intentional instructions revealed no significantdifferences, indicating that the same social mentalizing network was recruited.There was, however, a difference with respect to different brain areas thatpassed the significance threshold, suggesting that this common network wasrecruited to a different degree. Specifically, spontaneous inferencessignificantly recruited only core mentalizing areas, including thetemporo-parietal junction and medial prefrontal cortex, whereas intentionalinferences additionally recruited other brain areas, including the (pre)cuneus,superior temporal sulcus, temporal poles, and parts of the premotor and parietal cortex. These results suggest that intentional instructions invite observers tothink more about the material they read, and consider it in many ways besides itssocial impact. Future research on the neurological underpinnings of traitinference might profit from the use of spontaneous instructions to get purerresults that involve only the core brain areas in social judgment.
 Primates live in highly social environments, where prosocial behaviors promotesocial bonds and cohesion and contribute to group members' fitness. Despite agrowing interest in the biological basis of nonhuman primates' socialinteractions, their underlying motivations remain a matter of debate. We reportthat macaque monkeys take into account the welfare of their peers when makingbehavioral choices bringing about pleasant or unpleasant outcomes to a monkeypartner. Two macaques took turns in making decisions that could impact their own welfare or their partner's. Most monkeys were inclined to refrain from deliveringa mildly aversive airpuff and to grant juice rewards to their partner. Choiceconsistency between these two types of outcome suggests that monkeys displaycoherent motivations in different social interactions. Furthermore, spontaneousaffilitative group interactions in the home environment were mostly consistentwith the measured social decisions, thus emphasizing the impact of preexistingsocial bonds on decision-making. Interestingly, unique behavioral markerspredicted these decisions: benevolence was associated with enhanced mutual gazeand empathic eye blinking, whereas indifference or malevolence was associatedwith lower or suppressed such responses. Together our results suggest thatprosocial decision-making is sustained by an intrinsic motivation for socialaffiliation and controlled through positive and negative vicariousreinforcements.
 Theoretical advances in the science of consciousness have proposed that it isconcomitant with balanced cortical integration and differentiation, enabled byefficient networks of information transfer across multiple scales. Here, we applygraph theory to compare key signatures of such networks in high-densityelectroencephalographic data from 32 patients with chronic disorders ofconsciousness, against normative data from healthy controls. Based onconnectivity within canonical frequency bands, we found that patient networks hadreduced local and global efficiency, and fewer hubs in the alpha band. We deviseda novel topographical metric, termed modular span, which showed that the alphanetwork modules in patients were also spatially circumscribed, lacking thestructured long-distance interactions commonly observed in the healthy controls. Importantly however, these differences between graph-theoretic metrics werepartially reversed in delta and theta band networks, which were alsosignificantly more similar to each other in patients than controls. Goingfurther, we found that metrics of alpha network efficiency also correlated withthe degree of behavioural awareness. Intriguingly, some patients in behaviourallyunresponsive vegetative states who demonstrated evidence of covert awareness withfunctional neuroimaging stood out from this trend: they had alpha networks thatwere remarkably well preserved and similar to those observed in the controls.Taken together, our findings inform current understanding of disorders ofconsciousness by highlighting the distinctive brain networks that characterisethem. In the significant minority of vegetative patients who follow commands inneuroimaging tests, they point to putative network mechanisms that could support cognitive function and consciousness despite profound behavioural impairment.
 Positive behavioral responses to attractive faces have led neuroscientists toinvestigate underlying neural mechanisms in a "reward circuit" that includesbrain regions innervated by dopamine pathways. Using male faces ranging fromattractive to extremely unattractive, disfigured ones, this study is the first todemonstrate heightened responses to both rewarding and aversive faces in numerousareas of this putative reward circuit. Parametric analyses employing orthogonallinear and nonlinear regressors revealed positive nonlinear effects in anteriorcingulate cortex, lateral orbital frontal cortex (LOFC), striatum (nucleusaccumbens, caudate, putamen), and ventral tegmental area, in addition toreplicating previously documented linear effects in medial orbital frontal cortex(MOFC) and LOFC and nonlinear effects in amygdala and MOFC. The widespreadnonlinear responses are consistent with single cell recordings in animals showingresponses to both rewarding and aversive stimuli, and with some human fMRIinvestigations of non-face stimuli. They indicate that the reward circuit doesnot process face valence with any simple dissociation of function acrossstructures. Perceiver gender modulated some responses to our male faces: Womenshowed stronger linear effects, and men showed stronger nonlinear effects, which may have functional implications. Our discovery of nonlinear responses toattractiveness throughout the reward circuit echoes the history of amygdalaresearch: Early work indicated a linear response to threatening stimuli,including faces; later work also revealed a nonlinear response with heightenedactivation to affectively salient stimuli regardless of valence. The challengeremains to determine how such dual coding influences feelings, such as pleasureand pain, and guides goal-related behavioral responses, such as approach andavoidance.
 Dehumanization is anecdotally and historically associated with reduced empathyfor the pain of dehumanized individuals and groups and with psychological andlegal denial of their human rights and extreme violence against them. Wehypothesize that 'empathy' for the pain and suffering of dehumanized socialgroups is automatically reduced because, as the research we review suggests, anindividual's neural mechanisms of pain empathy best respond to (or produceempathy for) the pain of people whom the individual automatically or implicitlyassociates with her or his own species. This theory has implications for thephilosophical conception of 'human' and of 'legal personhood' in human rightsjurisprudence. It further has implications for First Amendment free speechjurisprudence, including the doctrine of 'corporate personhood' and considerationof the potential harm caused by dehumanizing hate speech. We suggest that thenew, social neuroscience of empathy provides evidence that both the vagaries ofthe legal definition or legal fiction of 'personhood' and hate speech thatexplicitly and implicitly dehumanizes may (in their respective capacities toartificially humanize or dehumanize) manipulate the neural mechanisms of painempathy in ways that could pose more of a true threat to human rights andrights-based democracy than previously appreciated.
 Recent studies on empathy toward other-race individuals demonstrate apreferential neural response to own-race members' pain. Based on the observation that existing studies, using different techniques, did not provide a convergentscenario on how implicit racial prejudice relate to empathy in cross-racialcontexts, in the current commentary we claim that future efforts in this domainshould distinguish between processes of racial prejudice and racial stereotypes. These concepts have been differentiated in social psychology, and two independentmeasures have been provided to assess them. We propose that these aspects should be taken into further consideration in future studies to fully understand thesocial neuroscience of empathy in cross-racial contexts.
 The goals of the project Social Cognition and Functioning in Schizophrenia (SCAF)were to (1) identify the domains to target from social neuroscience fortranslation to clinical schizophrenia research, (2) identify the paradigms thatrepresent these domains for which the neural substrates are well documented, (3) adapt these paradigms for use in schizophrenia clinical trials, (4) assess thepsychometric properties of these measures, and (5) assess the external validityof these measures. The articles in this theme section present the initialfindings from the SCAF project. As more training and psychopharmacologicalstudies evaluate interventions for social cognition, the articles in this themesection are intended to serve as a guide for informed design decisions aboutpossible endpoints in clinical trials.
 AIMS: The thalamus is a major relay station that modulates input from manycortical areas and a filter for sensory input and is involved in thepathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, it still remainsunclear whether all thalamocortical networks are affected or whether there isselective vulnerability. In this study, we aimed to study the selectivevulnerability of different thalamocortical structural connections in ALS and totest the hypothesis of a specific impairment in motor-related thalamocorticalconnectivity. METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography was used toidentify thalamocortical structural pathways in 38 individuals with ALS and 35gender/age-matched control subjects. Thalami of both groups were parcellated intosubregions based on local patterns of thalamocortical connectivity. DTI measures of these distinct thalamocortical connections were derived and compared betweengroups. RESULTS: The analysis of probabilistic tractography showed that thestructural connectivity between bilateral pre/primary motor cortices andassociated thalamic subregions was specifically impaired in patients with ALS,while the other thalamocortical connections remained relatively intact. Inaddition, fractional anisotropy values of the impaired thalamocortical motorpathway were inversely correlated with the disease duration. CONCLUSION: Ourfindings provide direct evidence for selective impairment of the thalamocortical structural connectivity in ALS.
 In order to understand the so-called "social brain," we need to monitor socialinteractions in face-to-face paradigms. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is apromising technique to achieve this goal. We investigate the neuronalunderpinnings of sharing a task in a proper social context. We record corticalactivity by means of NIRS, while participants perform a joint Simon task.Different from other hemodynamic techniques, NIRS allows us to have bothparticipants sit comfortably close to each other in a realistic and ecologicalenvironment. We found higher activation in the sensorimotor cortex whileprocessing compatible trials as compared to incompatible ones referring to one's own action alternative. Strikingly, when the participant was not respondingbecause it was the turn of the other member of the pair, the inferior parietalwas activated. This study provides twofold findings: first, they suggest that thejoint Simon effect relies more on shared attentional mechanisms than a propermapping of the other's motor response. Second, they highlight the invaluablecontribution NIRS can afford to social neuroscience in order to preserveecological and naturalistic settings.
 Facial expressions contain both motor and emotional components. The inferiorfrontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior parietal cortex have been considered to composea mirror neuron system (MNS) for the motor components of facial expressions,while the amygdala and insula may represent an "additional" MNS for emotionalstates. Together, these systems may contribute to our understanding of facialexpressions. Here we further examine this possibility. In three separateevent-related fMRI experiment, subjects had to (1) observe (2) discriminate and(3) imitate facial expressions. Stimuli were dynamic neutral, happy, fearful and disgusted facial expressions, and in Experiments 1 and 2, an additional patternmotion condition. Importantly, during each experiment, subjects were unaware ofthe nature of the next experiments. Results demonstrate that even passive viewingof facial expressions activates a wide network of brain regions that were alsoinvolved in the execution of similar expressions, including the IFG/insula andthe posterior parietal cortex. Only a subset of these regions responded moreduring the observation of facial than pattern motion (bilateral ventral IFG,bilateral STS/MTG, bilateral amygdala, SMA). While the viewing of facialexpressions recruited similar brain regions in all three experiments, adding anactive task (discrimination, imitation) augmented the magnitude of theseactivations. Brain activations reflected differences in observed facialexpressions, with emotional expressions activating relatively more theinsula/frontal operculum, and neutral ones (blowing up the cheeks) thesomatosensory cortices (SII). Using movies, fear activated the amygdala anddisgust the insula, but other emotions activated these structures to a similardegree.
 Adult attachment style (AAS) refers to individual differences in the way peopleexperience and regulate their social relationships and corresponding emotions.Based on developmental and psychological research, it has been hypothesized that avoidant attachment style (AV) entails deactivating strategies in socialcontexts, whereas anxious attachment style (AX) involves hyper vigilance andup-regulation mechanisms. However, the neural substrates of differences in socialemotion regulation associated with AAS have not been systematically investigated.Here we used fMRI in 19 healthy adults to investigate the effect of AAS on theprocessing of pleasant or unpleasant social and nonsocial scenes. Participantswere asked either to naturally attend (NAT), cognitively reappraise (REAP), orbehaviorally suppress (ESUP) their emotional responses. Avoidantly attachedparticipants showed increased prefrontal and anterior cingulate activation tosocial negative scenes when making spontaneous emotion judgments. They alsoexhibited persistent increases in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and leftamygdala activity for the same stimuli during reappraisal, as well as additional activation in supplementary motor area and ventral caudate during the suppressionof social positive emotions. These results suggest that AV may imply lessefficient reappraisal strategies to regulate social negative emotions, and leadto higher conflict or effortful control when suppression cannot be employed. Incontrast, anxiously attached participants showed differential increases in theright amygdala and left parahippocampal cortex for social negative and positivestimuli, respectively, but only when making spontaneous emotion judgments. Noeffect of AX was found during down-regulation conditions. This suggestsheightened arousal to negative information without difficulty in down-regulating emotions through cognitive re-evaluation or suppression. Taken together, thesefindings reveal for the first time the neural underpinnings of attachment-relateddifferences in social emotion regulation.
 Recent advances in neuroscience have provided new insights into the understandingof heart-brain interaction and communication. Cardiac information to the brainrelies on two pathways, terminating in the insular cortex (IC) and anteriorcingulate cortex (ACC), along with the somatosensory cortex (S1-S2).Interoception relying on these neuroanatomical pathways has been shown tomodulate social cognition. We report the case study of C.S., a patient with an'external heart' (an extracorporeal left-univentricular cardiac assist device,LVAD). The patient was assessed with neural/behavioral measures of cardiacinteroception complemented by neuropsychological and social cognition measures.The patient's performance on the interoception task (heartbeat detection) seemed to be guided by signals from the artificial LVAD, which provides a somatosensory beat rather than by his endogenous heart. Cortical activity (HEP,heartbeat-evoked potential) was found decreased in comparison with normalvolunteers, particularly during interoceptive states. The patient accuratelyperformed several cognitive tasks, except for interoception-related socialcognition domains (empathy, theory of mind and decision making). This evidencesuggests an imbalance in the patient's cardiac interoceptive pathways thatenhances sensation driven by the artificial pump over that from the cardiacvagal-IC/ACC pathway. A patient with two hearts, one endogenous and oneartificial, presents a unique opportunity to explore models of interoception and heart-brain interaction.
 Stereotype threat, a situational pressure individuals experience when they fearconfirming a negative group stereotype, engenders a cascade of physiologicalstress responses, negative appraisals, and performance monitoring processes that tax working memory resources necessary for optimal performance. Less is known,however, about how stereotype threat biases attentional processing in response toperformance feedback, and how such attentional biases may undermine performance. Women received feedback on math problems in stereotype threatening compared tostereotype-neutral contexts while continuous EEG activity was recorded. Findings revealed that stereotype threatened women elicited larger midline P100 ERPs,increased phase locking between anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateralprefrontal cortex (two regions integral for attentional processes), and increasedpower in left fusiform gyrus in response to negative feedback compared topositive feedback and women in stereotype-neutral contexts. Increased power inleft fusiform gyrus in response to negative feedback predicted underperformanceon the math task among stereotype threatened women only. Women instereotype-neutral contexts exhibited the opposite trend. Findings suggest thatin stereotype threatening contexts, neural networks integral for attention andworking memory are biased toward negative, stereotype confirming feedback at veryearly speeds of information processing. This bias, in turn, plays a role inundermining performance.
 The right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) is involved in intention understandingduring interpersonal interactions. To examine how prior experience of cooperationand competition affects one's right IFG activation in the subsequent interaction,using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) we simultaneously measured pairedparticipants' bilateral IFG activations during a turn-taking game. Participantpairs were assigned to either one of two roles: a Builder taking the initial moveto copy a target disk-pattern on monitor and the Partner taking the second moveto aid in (cooperation) or to obstruct (competition) the Builder. The experiment consisted of two sessions. One participant (B-P) played as a Builder (B-) insession 1 and changed the role to the Partner (-P) in session 2, and vice versafor the paired participant (P-B). NIRS data in competition demonstrated that the Builder (B-) being obstructed in session 1 showed higher right IFG activationwhen (s)he took a role of obstructor (-P) in session 2 (the obstructed effect),whereas "the cooperated effect" was not revealed in cooperation. These resultssuggest that prior experience of being obstructed may facilitate understanding ofthe Builder and/or the obstructor's tactical move, thereby increasing his/herright IFG activation when one is meant to obstruct in subsequent competitions.
 Social cognition and the corresponding functionality of involved brain networksare essential for effortless social interaction. Patients with schizophreniaexhibit impaired social functioning. In this study, we focused on the neuralnetworks involved in the automatic perception of cooperative behavior and theiralterations in schizophrenia. We performed a functional magnetic resonanceimaging study of 19 schizophrenia patients and 19 healthy matched controls.Participants watched a set of short videos with two actors manipulating objects, either with (C+) or without cooperation (C-). Additionally, we assesseddelusional symptoms in patients using the Scales for the Assessment of PositiveSymptoms and psychosis proneness in healthy controls using the brief schizotypal personality questionnaire. The observed group-by-condition interaction revealed acontrasting activation pattern for patients versus healthy controls in the medialand lateral prefrontal cortex, the middle cingulate cortex, and the left angular gyrus. Furthermore, increased activation of the middle prefrontal areas, leftangular gyrus, and the posterior sulcus temporalis superior in response to thenoncooperative condition (C-) was positively correlated with delusional symptoms in patients. Our findings suggest an overactivated "theory of mind" network inpatients for the processing of noncooperative behavior. Thus, "overmentalizing"might be based on delusions and altered processing of cooperative behavior inpatients with schizophrenia.
 Social anhedonia (SA), a trait-like disinterest in social contact and diminished capacity to experience pleasure from social interactions, is consistentlyassociated with social impairments in both healthy and clinical populations.However, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between SA and socialimpairment are poorly understood. Attentional control, selecting and focusing on relevant information and inhibiting irrelevant, may be one such mechanism. Weexamined individual differences in SA, attentional control, and social impairmentin 108 healthy adults. High SA related to low attentional control and high socialimpairment. Moreover, attentional control mediated the relationship between SAand social impairment, establishing attentional control as one mechanismunderlying aberrations in the fundamental human need for social contact. Althoughboth attentional deficits and social impairment have been separately noted in SA,the relationship between SA, attentional control and social impairment in thisnon-clinical sample reflects a novel contribution.
 Patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) exhibit marked changes in social and emotional functioning including lack of empathy, disinhibition, altered emotionalreactivity, apathy and lack of insight. These changes are believed to bedependent on progressive frontal and temporal lobe degeneration. In this review, we discuss the nature of defective theory of mind and empathy in this group andrelate it to regional dysfunction in the orbitofrontal and medial prefrontalcortex, based on evidence from several recent studies. The role of executiveability and co-existing emotional deficits are also considered.
 This study uses fMRI to investigate the cognitive demands of decision-making intwo types of cooperation games: a prisoner's dilemma (PD) eliciting a temptation to free-ride, leading to a dominant, self-interested response, and a stag hunt(SH) that has no dominant response but offers pay-off incentives that make mutualcooperation collectively beneficial but risky. Consequently, the PD poses greaterconflict between self- and collective interest, greater demands for computationalreasoning to derive the optimal solution, and greater demands for mentalizing to infer the intentions of others. Consistent with these differences between the twogames, the results indicate that the PD is associated with increased activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus, prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, andtemporoparietal junction. With less conflict, the demands for computation andmentalizing are reduced in the SH, and cooperation levels increase dramatically. The differences in brain activation elicited by the different incentivestructures of the PD and the SH appear to be independent of individualdifferences in revealed social preferences.
 Social interactions require fast and efficient person perception, which is bestachieved through the process of categorization. However, this process can producepernicious outcomes, particularly in the case of stigma. This study used fMRI to investigate the neural correlates involved in forming both explicit ("Do you likeor dislike this person?") and implicit ("Is this a male or female?") judgments ofpeople possessing well-established stigmatized conditions (obesity, facialpiercings, transsexuality, and unattractiveness), as well as normal controls.Participants also made post-scan disgust ratings on all the faces that theyviewed during imaging. These ratings were subsequently examined (modeledlinearly) in a parametric analysis. Regions of interest that emerged includeareas previously demonstrated to respond to aversive and disgust-inducingmaterial (amygdala and insula), as well as regions strongly associated withinhibition and control (anterior cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortex).Further, greater differences in activation were observed in the implicitcondition for both the amygdala and prefrontal cortical regions in response tothe most negatively perceived faces. Specifically, as subcortical responses(e.g., amygdala) increased, cortical responses (e.g., lateral PFC and anteriorcingulate) also increased, indicating the possibility of inhibitory processing.These findings help elucidate the neural underpinnings of stigma.
 Both oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) are known to modulate social behavior,and dysfunction in both systems has been postulated as a potential cause ofcertain psychiatric disorders that involve social behavioral deficits. Inparticular, there is growing interest in intranasal OT as a potential treatmentfor certain psychiatric disorders, and preliminary pre-clinical and clinicalstudies suggest efficacy in alleviating some of the associated symptoms. However,the vast majority of research participants in these studies have been male, andthere is evidence for sexually differentiated effects of nonapeptides in bothhumans and non-human animals. To date, no study has investigated the effect ofintranasal OT on brain function in human males and females within the sameparadigm. Previously, in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind fMRIstudy, we reported effects of intranasal OT and AVP on behavior and brainactivity of human males as they played an interactive social game known as thePrisoner's Dilemma Game. Here, we present findings from an identical study inhuman females, and compare these with our findings from males. Overall, we findthat both behavioral and neural responses to intranasal OT and AVP are highlysexually differentiated. In women, AVP increased conciliatory behavior, and both OT and AVP caused women to treat computer partners more like humans. In men, AVP increased reciprocation of cooperation from both human and computer partners.However, no specific drug effects on behavior were shared between men and women. During cooperative interactions, both OT and AVP increased brain activity in men within areas rich in OT and AVP receptors and in areas playing a key role inreward, social bonding, arousal and memory (e.g., the striatum, basal forebrain, insula, amygdala and hippocampus), whereas OT and AVP either had no effect or in some cases actually decreased brain activity in these regions in women. OTtreatment rendered neural responses of males more similar to responses of femalesin the placebo group and vice versa, raising the prospect of an inverted u-shapeddose response to central OT levels. These findings emphasize the need to fullycharacterize the effects of intranasal OT and AVP in both males and females andat multiple doses before widespread clinical application will be warranted.
 Autism spectrum disorder (autism) is a highly prevalent and heterogeneous family of neurodevelopmental disorders of genetic origins with potentially devastatingimplications for child, family, health and educational systems. Despite advances in paper-and-pencil screening and in standardization of diagnostic procedures,diagnosis of autism in the US still hovers around the ages of four or five years,later still in disadvantaged communities, and several years after the age of two to three years when the condition can be reliably diagnosed by expert clinicians.As early detection and treatment are two of the most important factors optimizingoutcome, and given that diagnosis is typically a necessary condition for familiesto have access to early treatment, reducing age of diagnosis has become one ofthe greatest priorities of the field. Recent advances in developmental socialneuroscience promise the advent of cost-effective and community-viable,performance-based procedures, and suggest a complementary method for promotinguniversal screening and much greater access to the diagnosis process. Small butcritical studies have already reported on experiments that differentiate groupsof children at risk for autism from controls, and at least one study so far couldpredict diagnostic classification and level of disability on the basis of a briefexperiment. Although the road to translating such procedures into effectivedevices for screening and diagnosis is still a long one, and premature claimsshould be avoided, this effort could be critical in addressing this worldwidepublic health challenge.
 The overt pronoun constraint (OPC) states that, in null subject languages, overt pronoun subjects of embedded clauses cannot be bound by wh- or quantifierantecedents. Through the administration of two written questionnaires, weexamined the OPC in 246 monolingual native speakers of three dialects of Spanish,spoken in Barranquilla (Colombia), Santiago (Chile), and Buenos Aires(Argentina). We tested separately the predictions that overt pronouns cannot bebound by wh- antecedents (Experiment 1) and that they cannot be bound byquantifier antecedents (Experiment 2). We found that the OPC was not operative inany of these dialects. In Experiment 1, the percentage of bound answers wasapproximately the same as the percentage of anaphoric answers. In Experiment 2,the percentage of bound answers was significantly higher than the percentage ofanaphoric answers. Implications both for theories of pronoun resolution in nullsubject languages and for theories of first and second language acquisition arediscussed.
 BACKGROUND: Individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) have difficultiesrecognizing mental states in others. Most research has focused on recognition of basic emotions from faces and voices separately. This study reports the resultsof a new task, assessing recognition of complex emotions and mental states fromsocial scenes taken from feature films. The film format arguably is morechallenging and ecologically closer to real social situations. SAMPLE AND METHOD:A group of adults with ASC (n=22) were compared to a group of matched controlsfrom the general population (n=22). Participants were tested individually.RESULTS: Overall, individuals with ASC performed significantly lower thancontrols. There was a positive correlation between verbal IQ and task scores.Using task scores, more than 90% of the participants were correctly allocated to their group. Item analysis showed that the errors individuals with ASC make when judging socioemotional information are subtle. CONCLUSIONS: This new test ofcomplex emotion and mental state recognition reveals that adults with ASC haveresidual difficulties in this aspect of empathy. The use of language-basedcompensatory strategies for emotion recognition is discussed.
 Recent research suggests that obesity is linked to prominent alterations inlearning and decision-making. This general difference may also underlie thepreference for immediately consumable, highly palatable but unhealthy andhigh-calorie foods. Such poor food-related inter-temporal decision-making canexplain weight gain; however, it is not yet clear whether this deficit can begeneralized to other domains of inter-temporal decision-making, for examplefinancial decisions. Further, little is known about the stability ofdecision-making behavior in obesity, especially in the presence of rewardingcues. To answer these questions, obese and lean participants (n = 52) completedtwo sessions of a novel priming paradigm including a computerized monetary delay discounting task. In the first session, general differences between groups infinancial delay discounting were measured. In the second session, we tested thegeneral stability of discount rates. Additionally, participants were primed byaffective visual cues of different contextual categories before making financial decisions. We found that the obese group showed stronger discounting of futuremonetary rewards than the lean group, but groups did not differ in their general stability between sessions nor in their sensitivity toward changes in rewardmagnitude. In the obese group, a fast decrease of subjective value over time was directly related to a higher tendency for opportunistic eating. Obese in contrastto lean people were primed by the affective cues, showing a sex-specific pattern of priming direction. Our findings demonstrate that environments rich of cues,aiming at inducing unhealthy consumer decisions, can be highly detrimental forobese people. It also underscores that obesity is not merely a medical condition but has a strong cognitive component, meaning that current dietary and medicaltreatment strategies may fall too short.
 Putative contributions of a human mirror neuron system (hMNS) to the perceptionof social information have been assessed by measuring the suppression of EEGoscillations in the mu/alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (15-25 Hz) and low-gamma (25-25 Hz) ranges while participants processed social information revealed by point-lightdisplays of human motion. Identical dynamic displays were presented andparticipants were instructed to distinguish the intention, the emotion, or thegender of a moving image of a person, while they performed an adapted odd-balltask. Relative to a baseline presenting a nonbiological but meaningful motiondisplay, all three biological motion conditions reduced the EEG amplitude in the mu/alpha and beta ranges, but not in the low-gamma range. Suppression was larger in the intention than in the emotion and gender conditions, with no differencebetween the latter two. Moreover, the suppression in the intention condition was negatively correlated with an accepted measure of empathy (EQ), revealing thatparticipants high in empathy scores manifested less suppression. For intentionand emotion the suppression was larger at occipital than at central sites,suggesting that factors other than motor system were in play while processingsocial information embedded in the motion of point-light displays.
 The term 'social brain' refers to the network of brain regions that are involved in understanding others. Behaviour that is related to social cognition changesdramatically during human adolescence. This is paralleled by functional changesthat occur in the social brain during this time, in particular in the medialprefrontal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus, which show altered activityduring the performance of social cognitive tasks, such as face recognition andmental-state attribution. Research also indicates that, in humans, these parts ofthe social brain undergo structural development, including synapticreorganization, during adolescence. Bringing together two relatively new andrapidly expanding areas of neuroscience--social neuroscience and the study ofbrain development during adolescence--will increase our understanding of how the social brain develops during adolescence.
 The impact of stress on health varies across the different stages of human life. Aging is associated with psychobiological changes that could limit our ability tocope with stressors. Therefore, it is crucial to clarify the physiologicalmechanisms that underlie the stress response and the changes that occur in themas we age. Our aim was to investigate age differences in the salivary alphaamylase (sAA) response to stress, and its relationship with other typical stress biomarkers such as cortisol and heart rate (HR). Sixty-two participants dividedinto two age groups (younger group: N=31, age range: 18-35 years; older group:N=31, age range: 54-71 years) were exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test and a control condition in a crossover design. No age differences were found in the sAAor HR responses to stress. However, the sAA global output was higher in olderthan younger adults. Additionally, in the stress condition, the total amount ofcortisol released was positively related to the total sAA released, while the HR increase was positively related to the sAA increase. Our results do not supportthe existence of an attenuated autonomic nervous system response to stress inolder adults, but rather a heightened sympathetic tone. Furthermore, we foundfurther evidence of the coordination between the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenalsystem and the autonomic nervous system in their response to acute psychosocialstress.
 This special issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Attitudesand Social Cognition is devoted to theory and research at the interface of socialpsychology and neuroscience. The 5 empirical articles represent the theoreticaland methodological breadth of issues considered by social neuroscientists. Themethods span brain lesion work to neuroendocrinology to psychophysiologicalindicators of brain activity to functional magnetic resonance imaging indicators of brain activity. The remaining 2 articles consider explicitly some of thepromises and pitfalls of social neuroscience; these authors, although noting the power of neuroscience methods, remind readers of the serious challenges posed in trying to examine the biological processes underlying or associated with socialpsychological phenomena. These articles help to reveal the richness of socialneuroscience and the power of neuroscientific methods to address processes andmechanisms that would not be possible with traditional social psychology methods.
 This study investigates to what extent social and competence traits arerepresented in a similar or different neural trait code. To localize these trait codes, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging repetition suppression,which is a rapid reduction of neuronal responses upon repeated presentation ofthe same implied trait. Participants had to infer an agent's trait from brieftrait-implying behavioral descriptions. In each trial, the critical targetsentence was preceded by a prime sentence that implied the same trait or adifferent competence-related trait which was also opposite in valence. Theresults revealed robust repetition suppression from prime to target in theventral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) given a similar (social) as well as adissimilar (competence) prime. The suppression given a similar prime confirmsearlier research demonstrating that a trait code is represented in the ventralmPFC. The suppression given a dissimilar prime is interpreted as indicating that participants categorize a combination of competence and social information intonovel subcategories, reflecting nice (but incompetent) or nerdy (but sociallyawkward) traits. A multi-voxel pattern analysis broadly confirmed these results, and pinpointed the inferior parietal cortex, cerebellum, temporo-parietaljunction and mPFC as areas that differentiate between social and competencetraits.
 Callous-unemotional traits - the insensitivity to other's welfare and well-being - are characterized by a lack of empathy. They are characteristic of psychopathy and can be found in other anti-social disorders, such as conduct disorder.Because of the increasing prevalence of anti-social disorders and the risingsocietal costs of violence and aggression, it is of great importance to elucidatethe psychological and physiological mechanisms underlying callousness in thesearch for pharmacological treatments. One promising avenue is to create arelevant animal model to explore the neural bases of callousness. Here, we reviewrecent advances in rodent models of pro-social choice that could be applied toprobe the absence of pro-sociality as a proxy of callous behavior, and providefuture directions for the exploration of the neural substrates of callousness.
 Incidental emotions, which are irrelevant to the current decision, play asignificant role in the decision-making process. In this study, to investigatethe influence of incidental emotions on behavioral, psychological, andelectrophysiological responses in the process of decision making, participantswere required to perform a monetary gambling task. During the selection stage, anemotional picture, which was chosen from the Chinese Affective Picture System andfell into one of three categories: negative, neutral, and positive, was presentedbetween two alternatives (small/large amount of bet). The pictures were provided to induce incidental emotions. ERPs and self-rating emotional experiences tooutcome feedback were recorded during the task. Behavioral results showed thatpositive incidental emotions elicited risk preference, but emotional experiences to outcome feedback were not influenced by incidental emotions. Thefeedback-related negativity amplitudes were larger in the positive emotioncondition than in the negative and neutral emotion conditions for small outcomes (including wins and losses), whereas there was no difference between the threeconditions for large outcomes. In addition, the amplitudes of P3 were reducedoverall in the negative emotion condition. We suggest that incidental emotionshave modulated both the option assessment stage (manifested in behavioralchoices) and the outcome evaluation stage (manifested in ERP amplitudes) ofdecision making unconsciously (indicated by unchanged subjective emotionalexperiences). The current findings have expanded our understanding of the role ofincidental emotion in decision making.
 Previous neuroeconomic studies have observed that people display sympatheticneural responses toward others' misfortunes. We argue that the reverse emotions, such as gloating or schadenfreude, may also emerge in certain circumstances. Toexamine this theory, we recorded feedback-related negativity (FRN) toward others'large or small gains or losses in a stock market context. We adopted theframework of social distance, according to which we hypothesized that becauseothers in the stock market are far away, unidentified, and indistinct, peoplewould show less sympathy or even schadenfreude toward others' large losses. Theresults indicated that FRN at Fz was significantly less negative when observinglarger decreases in others' stock, indicating that others' large losses are notunexpected negative events in the stock market and suggesting the existence ofschadenfreude. Our research contributes to the understanding of socialneurofinance by demonstrating the schadenfreude effect in relation to the stockmarket. This study also provides new information regarding the relationshipbetween FRN and the social emotions that form the expectations of gain and loss.
 Both autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and psychopathy are primarily characterizedby social dysfunction; overlapping phenotypic features may reflect alteredfunction in common brain mechanisms. The current study examined the degree towhich neural response to social and nonsocial feedback is modulated by autisticversus psychopathic traits in a sample of typically developing adults (N = 31, 11males, 18-52 years). Event-related potentials were recorded whilst participantscompleted a behavioral task and received feedback on task performance. Bothautistic and psychopathic traits were associated with alterations in the neuralcorrelates of feedback processing. Sensitivity to specific forms of feedback(social, nonsocial, positively valenced, negatively valenced) differed betweenthe two traits. Autistic traits were associated with decreased sensitivity tosocial feedback. In contrast, the antisocial domain of psychopathic traits wasassociated with an overall decrease in sensitivity to feedback, and theinterpersonal manipulation domain was associated with preserved processing ofpositively valenced feedback. Results suggest distinct alterations withinspecific mechanisms of feedback processing may underlie similar difficulties insocial behavior.
 Despite the well-documented benefits afforded the children of invested fathers inmodern Western societies, some fathers choose not to invest in their children.Why do some men make this choice? Life History Theory offers an explanation forvariation in parental investment by positing a trade-off between mating andparenting effort, which may explain some of the observed variance in humanfathers' parenting behavior. We tested this hypothesis by measuring aspects ofreproductive biology related to mating effort, as well as paternal nurturingbehavior and the brain activity related to it. Both plasma testosterone levelsand testes volume were independently inversely correlated with paternalcaregiving. In response to viewing pictures of one's own child, activity in theventral tegmental area--a key component of the mesolimbic dopamine reward andmotivation system--predicted paternal caregiving and was negatively related totestes volume. Our results suggest that the biology of human males reflects atrade-off between mating effort and parenting effort, as indexed by testicularsize and nurturing-related brain function, respectively.
 The human brain may contain "mirror systems" allowing mental simulation of thesensorimotor states of others. Most research has focused on interpersonal sharingof motor representations, with relatively little focus on sensation. Here we showthat viewing the body of another person significantly enhances the spatialresolution of touch on the corresponding body part. Thirty subjects judged theorientation of gratings presented to the index finger tip, either when viewingtheir own hand, when viewing a neutral object presented in approximately the samelocation, or when viewing the undisguised hand of a third person standing behind them. Orientation discrimination was significantly more accurate when viewingone's own body compared to when viewing a neutral object. The same enhancementeffect was found when viewing another's body. Performance when viewing one's own body did not differ significantly from performance when viewing the body ofanother person. This result suggests a purely sensory interpersonal sharing ofbody representations. It also suggests a specifically interpersonal modulation ofprimary sensory functions within the brain.
 Neuroscientific research has consistently found that the perception of anaffective state in another activates the observer's own neural substrates for thecorresponding state, which is likely the neural mechanism for "true empathy."However, to date there has not been a brain-imaging investigation of so-called"cognitive empathy", whereby one "actively projects oneself into the shoes ofanother person," imagining someone's personal, emotional experience as if it wereone's own. In order to investigate this process, we conducted a combinedpsychophysiology and PET and study in which participants imagined: (1) a personalexperience of fear or anger from their own past; (2) an equivalent experiencefrom another person as if it were happening to them; and (3) a nonemotionalexperience from their own past. When participants could relate to the scenario ofthe other, they produced patterns of psychophysiological and neuroimagingactivation equivalent to those of personal emotional imagery, but when they couldnot relate to the other's story, differences emerged on all measures, e.g.,decreased psychophysiological responses and recruitment of a region between theinferior temporal and fusiform gyri. The substrates of cognitive empathy overlap with those of personal feeling states to the extent that one can relate to thestate and situation of the other.
 Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe, chronic disease with a heritability of 60-80%.BD is frequently misdiagnosed due to phenomenological overlap with otherpsychopathologies, an important issue that calls for the identification ofbiological and psychological vulnerability and disease markers. Alteredstructural and functional connectivity, mainly between limbic and prefrontalbrain areas, have been proposed to underlie emotional and motivationaldysregulation in BD and might represent relevant vulnerability and diseasemarkers. In the present laboratory review we discuss functional and structuralneuroimaging findings on emotional and motivational dysregulation from ourresearch group in BD patients and healthy individuals at risk to develop BD. As amain result of our studies, we observed altered orbitofrontal and limbic activityand reduced connectivity between dorsal prefrontal and limbic brain regions, aswell as reduced integrity of fiber tracts connecting prefrontal and subcorticalbrain structures in BD patients and high-risk individuals. Our results providenovel insights into pathophysiological mechanisms of bipolar disorder. Thecurrent laboratory review provides a specific view of our group on altered brain connectivity and underlying psychological processes in bipolar disorder based on our own work, integrating relevant findings from others. Thereby we attempt toadvance neuropsychobiological models of BD.
 Appropriate social problem solving constitutes a critical skill for individualsand may rely on processes important for self-generated thought (SGT). The aim of the current study was to investigate the link between SGT and social problemsolving. Using the Means-End Problem Solving task (MEPS), we assessedparticipants' abilities to resolve daily social problems in terms of overallefficiency and number of relevant means they provided to reach the givensolution. Participants also performed a non-demanding choice reaction time task(CRT) and a moderately-demanding working memory task (WM) as a context in whichto measure their SGT (assessed via thought sampling). We found that althoughoverall SGT was associated with lower MEPS efficiency, it was also associatedwith higher relevant means, perhaps because both depend on the capacity togenerate cognition that is independent from the hear and now. The specificcontent of SGT did not differentially predict individual differences in socialproblem solving, suggesting that the relationship may depend on SGT regardless ofits content. In addition, we also found that performance at the WM but not theCRT was linked to overall better MEPS performance, suggesting that individualsgood at social processing are also distinguished by their capacity to constrainattention to an external task. Our results provide novel evidence that thecapacity for SGT is implicated in the process by which solutions to socialproblems are generated, although optimal problem solving may be achieved byindividuals who display a suitable balance between SGT and cognition derived fromperceptual input.
 This electroencephalography (EEG) study investigated at which temporal processingstages self-other discrimination in emotion processing occurs. EEG was recordedin 23 healthy participants during silent reading of unpleasant, pleasant, andneutral pronoun-noun and article--noun expressions that were related to theparticipants themselves, related to an unknown third person, or had no self-otherreference at all. Self- and other-related pronoun--noun pairs elicited largercortical negativity relative to the processing of article--noun pairs at leftposterior electrodes as early as 200 ms after stimulus onset. In the same timewindows (from 200 ms to 300 ms and 300 ms to 400 ms) the emotionality of thewords enhanced event-related brain potential (ERP) amplitudes atparieto-occipital electrodes. From 350 ms onwards, processing of self-relatedunpleasant words elicited larger frontal negativity compared to unpleasant words that were related to the other or that had no reference at all. In addition,processing of pleasant words vs. neutral or unpleasant words elicited largerpositive amplitudes over parietal electrodes from 450 ms after stimulus onset, inparticular when words were self-related. Our findings demonstrate that for verbalemotional stimuli, self--other discrimination first occurs at higher-order,cortical processing stages. This is consistent with the view that categorization of information according to certain stimulus aspects (self--other reference,emotionality) occurs before its meaning is integrated.
 Previous studies examining empathy have revealed the neural substrates of how thephysical pain of others is represented in the human brain. However, little isknown about the empathic modulation of behavioral and neural responses to others'economic payoffs, especially in the social context. In the present study, weengaged participants in a revised Dictator Game as observers who observe thepowerless players receiving varied offers proposed by the dominant players,establishing the link between empathy and fairness perception. Results showedthat unfair division schemes elicited a more pronounced FRN than fair ones onlyif a human agent proposed the initial offer. In addition, observers sacrificedtheir own payments to adjust unfair proposals, especially when a human agentproposed the offer. Thus, results of the current study demonstrated thatperceived intention modulates behavioral and neural responses to others' economicpayoffs in social interactions.
 Social support can attenuate the behavioral and stress hormone response tothreat, a phenomenon called social buffering. The mother's social buffering ofthe infant is one of the more robust examples; yet we understand little about theneurobiology. Using a rodent model, we explore the neurobiology of socialbuffering by assessing neural processing of the maternal odor, a major cuecontrolling social buffering in rat pups. We used pups before (postnatal day (PN)7) and after (PN14, PN23) the functional emergence of social buffering. Pups wereinjected with 14C 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and presented with the maternal odor, acontrol preferred odor incapable of social buffering (acetophenone), or no odor. Brains were removed, processed for autoradiography and brain areas identified as important in adult social buffering were assessed, including the amygdalabasolateral complex (Basolateral Amygdala [BLA]), medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Results suggest dramatic changes in the processing of maternal odor. PN7 pups show mPFC and ACC activation, although PN14 pups showed no activation of the mPFC, ACC, or BLA. All brain areas assessedwere recruited by PN23. Additional analysis suggests substantial changes infunctional connectivity across development. Together, these results imply complexnonlinear transitions in the neurobiology of social buffering in early life that may provide insight into the changing role of the mother in supporting socialbuffering.
 An adaptation paradigm was used to investigate the influence of a previouslyexperienced visual context on the interpretation of ambiguous emotionalexpressions. Affective classification of fear-neutral ambiguous expressions wasperformed following repeated exposure to either fearful or neutral faces. Therewas a shift in the behavioral classification of morphs toward "fear" followingadaptation to neutral compared to adaptation to fear with a nonsignificant trend toward the high-anxiety group compared to the low being more influenced by thecontext. The event-related potential (ERP) data revealed a more pronounced latepositive potential (LPP), beginning at ~400 ms poststimulus onset, in the highbut not the low-anxiety group following adaptation to neutral compared to fear.In addition, as the size of the behavioral adaptation increased, there was alinear increase in the magnitude of the late-LPP. However, context-sensitivityeffects are not restricted to trait anxiety, with similar effects observed withstate anxiety and depression. These data support the proposal that negative moodsare associated with increased sensitivity to visual contextual influences fromtop-down elaborative modulations, as reflected in an enhanced LPP deflection.
 Lesion and neuroimaging studies have implicated the medial frontal lobes asplaying an important role in our ability to predict other people's behavior byattributing to them mental states, such as beliefs, intention and emotion (termed"Theory of Mind"; ToM). However, recent studies have challenged these findings byhighlighting the role of the temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) in ToM. In thepresent study, we tested the hypothesis that the ventromedial (VM) prefrontalcortex plays a unique role in affective ToM reasoning rather than a general role in ToM. We compared the performance of patients with lesions localized either in the VM, dorsolateral, TPJ, or superior parietal to healthy controls, with abattery of naturalistic affective and cognitive ToM stories (about false beliefs,false attribution, irony and lies). Patients with VM damage were impaired atproviding appropriate mental state explanations for the affective ToM stories,compared to healthy controls and patients with posterior damage. In the VM group,performance in the affective ToM was significantly impaired as compared tocognitive ToM stories. Furthermore, in the VM group, ratings of levels ofemotionality of each story suggested that levels of affective load correlatedwith number of errors in the stories, indicating that the more the emotional loadinvolved in the story the greater the difficulty posed for the subjects in thisgroup.
 Self-referential processing is a core component of social cognition. However, fewstudies have focused on whether self-referential processing deficits present inbipolar disorder. The current study combined a high-time-resolution event-relatedpotential (ERP) technique with the self-referential memory (SRM) task to evaluateself-referential processing in 23 bipolar patients and 27 healthy controls. Allsubjects showed a reliable SRM effect, but the bipolar group had poorerrecognition scores for the self- and other-referential conditions. The bipolargroup presented with smaller voltages in both the self- and other-referentialconditions for the N1 (150-220 ms) and the P2 components (130-320 ms) but larger voltages in the positive slow wave (600-1600 ms) component. Larger P3 amplitudes were elicited in the self-referential condition compared with theother-referential condition in controls but not in bipolar patients.Additionally, non-psychotic bipolar patients had a comparative normal SRM effect which was abolished in psychotic bipolar patients; non-psychotic bipolar patientshad larger amplitudes of the positive slow wave than the normal controls, whereasit was not differed between psychotic bipolar patients and the healthy subjects. The present study suggests that self- and other-referential processing isimpaired in bipolar patients and the deficits may be more pronounced in psychoticbipolar patients.
 Social behavior and desire for social relationships have been independentlylinked to the serotonergic system, the prefrontal cortex, especially theorbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The goal of this study was to explore the role of serotonin 5HT(2A) receptors in these brain regions in forming and maintaining close interpersonal relationships. Twenty-fourhealthy subjects completed the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) prior toundergoing [(18)F]setoperone brain positron emission tomography (PET) to measure serotonin 5HT(2A) receptor availability within the OFC (BA 11 and 47) and ACC (BA32). We explored the relationship between desire for social relationships, asmeasured by the TCI reward dependence (RD) scale, and 5HT(2A) receptornon-displaceable binding potential (BP(nd)) in these regions. Scores of RD werenegatively correlated with 5HT(2A) BP(nd) in the ACC (BA 32, r = -.528, p = .012)and OFC (BA 11, r = -.489, p = .021; BA 47, r = -.501, p = .017). Thesecorrelations were corroborated by a voxel-wise analysis. These results suggestthat the serotonergic system may have a regulatory effect on the OFC and ACC for establishing and maintaining social relationships.
 Individuals may differ systematically in their applied decision strategies, whichhas critical implications for decision neuroscience but is yet scarcely studied. Our study's main focus was therefore to investigate the neural mechanismsunderlying compensatory versus noncompensatory strategies in risky choice. Here, we compared people using a compensatory expected value maximization with peopleusing a simplified noncompensatory loss-minimizing choice strategy. To this end, we used a two-choice paradigm including a set of "simple" items (e.g., simplecondition), in which one option was superior on all attributes, and a set of"conflict" items, in which one option was superior on one attribute but inferior on other attributes. A binomial mixture analysis of the decisions elicited bythese items differentiated between decision-makers using either a compensatory ora noncompensatory strategy. Behavioral differences were particularly pronouncedin the conflict condition, and these were paralleled by neural results. That is, we expected compensatory decision-makers to use an integrated value comparisonduring choice in the conflict condition. Accordingly, the compensatory grouptracked the difference in expected value between choice options reflected inneural activation in the parietal cortex. Furthermore, we expectednoncompensatory, compared with compensatory, decision-makers to experienceincreased conflict when attributes provided conflicting information. Accordingly,the noncompensatory group showed greater dorsomedial PFC activation only in theconflict condition. These pronounced behavioral and neural differences indicatethe need for decision neuroscience to account for individual differences in riskychoice strategies and to broaden its scope to noncompensatory risky choicestrategies.
 With the emergence of new technologies, there has been an explosion of basic and clinical research on the affective and cognitive neuroscience of face processing and emotion perception. Adult emotional face stimuli are commonly used in thesestudies. For developmental research, there is a need for a validated set of childemotional faces. This paper describes the development of the National Instituteof Mental Health Child Emotional Faces Picture Set (NIMH-ChEFS), a relativelylarge stimulus set with high quality, color images of the emotional faces ofchildren. The set includes 482 photographs of fearful, angry, happy, sad andneutral child faces with two gaze conditions: direct and averted gaze. In thispaper we describe the development of the NIMH-ChEFS and data on the set'svalidity based on ratings by 20 healthy adult raters. Agreement between the apriori emotion designation and the raters' labels was high and comparable withvalues reported for commonly used adult picture sets. Intensity,representativeness, and composite "goodness" ratings are also presented to guide researchers in their choice of specific stimuli for their studies. These datashould give researchers confidence in the NIMH-ChEFS's validity for use inaffective and social neuroscience research.
 Primate neurophysiology has revealed various neural mechanisms at the single-celllevel and population level. However, because recording techniques have not beenupdated for several decades, the types of experimental design that can be appliedin the emerging field of social neuroscience are limited, in particular thoseinvolving interactions within a realistic social environment. To address theselimitations and allow more freedom in experimental design to understand dynamicadaptive neural functions, multidimensional recording (MDR) was developed. MDRobtains behavioral, neural, eye position, and other biological datasimultaneously by using integrated multiple recording systems. MDR gives a widedegree of freedom in experimental design because the level of behavioralrestraint is adjustable depending on the experimental requirements while stillmaintaining the signal quality. The biggest advantage of MDR is that it canprovide a stable neural signal at higher temporal resolution at the network levelfrom multiple subjects for months, which no other method can provide.Conventional event-related analysis of MDR data shows results consistent withprevious findings, whereas new methods of analysis can reveal network mechanisms that could not have been investigated previously. MDR data are now shared in the public server Neurotycho.org. These recording and sharing methods support anecological system that is open to everyone and will be a valuable and powerfulresearch/educational platform for understanding the dynamic mechanisms of neural networks.
 Working memory (WM) refers to mental processes that enable temporary retentionand manipulation of information, including information about other people("social working memory"). Previous studies have demonstrated that nonsocial WMis supported by dopamine neurotransmission. Here, we investigated in 131 healthy adults whether dopamine is similarly involved in social WM by testing whethersocial and nonsocial WM are influenced by genetic variants in three genes coding for molecules regulating the availability of dopamine in the brain:catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), dopamine active transporter (DAT), andmonoamine-oxidase A (MAOA). An advantage for the Met allele of COMT was observed in the two standard WM tasks and in the social WM task. However, the influence ofCOMT on social WM performance was not accounted for by its influence on eitherstandard WM paradigms. There was no main effect of DAT1 or MAOA, but asignificant COMT x DAT1 interaction on social WM performance. This study providesnovel preliminary evidence of effects of genetic variants of the dopamineneurotransmitter system on social cognition. The results further suggest that theeffects observed on standard WM do not explain the genetic effects on effortfulsocial cognition.
 Schizophrenia is associated with abnormal cortical activation during theory ofmind (ToM), as demonstrated by several fMRI or PET studies. Electrical andtemporal characteristics of these abnormalities, especially in the early stages, remain unexplored. Nineteen medicated schizophrenic patients and 21 healthycontrols underwent magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording to measure brainresponse evoked by nonverbal stimuli requiring mentalizing. Three conditionsbased on comic-strips were contrasted: attribution of intentions to others (AI), physical causality with human characters (PCCH), and physical causality withobjects (PCOB). Minimum norm localization was performed in order to selectregions of interest (ROIs) within bilateral temporal and parietal regions thatshowed significant ToM-related activations in the control group. Time-courses of each ROI were compared across group and condition. Reduced cortical activationwithin the 200 to 600 ms time-window was observed in the selected regions inpatients. Significant group by condition interactions (i.e., reduced modulationin patients) were found in right posterior superior temporal sulcus, righttemporoparietal junction, and right inferior parietal lobule during attributionof intentions. As in healthy controls, the presence of characters elicitedactivation in patients' left posterior temporal regions and temporoparietaljunction. No group difference on evoked responses' latencies in AI was found. In conclusion, ToM processes in the early stages are functionally impaired inschizophrenia. MEG provides a promising means to refine our knowledge onschizophrenic social cognitive disorders.
 OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the presented study is to determine whether there arefrequency-independent high-frequency oscillation (HFO) parameters which maydiffer in epileptic and non-epileptic regions. METHODS: We studied 31 consecutivepatients with medically intractable focal (temporal and extratemporal) epilepsieswho were examined by either intracerebral or subdural electrodes. Automateddetection was used to detect HFO. The characteristics (rate, amplitude, andduration) of HFO were statistically compared within three groups: the seizureonset zone (SOZ), the irritative zone (IZ), and areas outside the IZ and SOZ(nonSOZ/nonIZ). RESULTS: In all patients, fast ripples (FR) and ripples (R) were significantly more frequent and shorter in the SOZ than in the nonSOZ/nonIZregion. In the group of patients with favorable surgical outcomes, the relativeamplitude of FR was higher in the SOZ than in the IZ and nonIZ/nonSOZ regions; inpatients with poor outcomes, the results were reversed. The relative amplitude ofR was significantly higher in the SOZ, with no difference between patients withpoor and favorable surgical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: FR are more frequent, shorter,and have higher relative amplitudes in the SOZ area than in other regions. Thestudy suggests a worse prognosis in patients with higher amplitudes of FR outsidethe SOZ. SIGNIFICANCE: Various HFO parameters, especially of FR, differ inepileptic and non-epileptic regions. The amplitude and duration may be asimportant as the frequency band and rate of HFO in marking the seizure onsetregion or the epileptogenic area and may provide additional information onepileptogenicity.
 With this commentary we make the case for an increased focus on the ecologicalvalidity of the measures used to assess aspects of human social functioning.Impairments in social functioning are seen in many types of psychopathology,negatively affecting the lives of psychiatric patients and those around them. Yetthe neurobiology underlying abnormal social interaction remains unclear. As anexample of human social neuroscience research with relevance to biologicalpsychiatry and clinical psychopharmacology, this commentary discusses publishedexperimental studies involving manipulation of the human brain serotonin systemthat included assessments of social behavior. To date, these studies have mostly been laboratory-based and included computer tasks, observations by others, orsingle-administration self-report measures. Most laboratory measures used so far inform about the role of serotonin in aspects of social interaction, but therelevance for real-life interaction is often unclear. Few studies have usednaturalistic assessments in real life. We suggest several laboratory methods withhigh ecological validity as well as ecological momentary assessment, whichinvolves intensive repeated measures in naturalistic settings. In sum, thiscommentary intends to stimulate experimental research on the neurobiology ofhuman social interaction as it occurs in real life.
 Group identification can lead to a biased view of the world in favor of"in-group" members. Studying the brain processes that underlie such in-groupbiases is important for a wider understanding of the potential influence ofsocial factors on basic perceptual processes. In this study, we used functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how people perceive the actions of in-group and out-group members, and how their biased view in favor of own teammembers manifests itself in the brain. We divided participants into two teams andhad them judge the relative speeds of hand actions performed by an in-group andan out-group member in a competitive situation. Participants judged hand actions performed by in-group members as being faster than those of out-group members,even when the two actions were performed at physically identical speeds. In anadditional fMRI experiment, we showed that, contrary to common belief, suchskewed impressions arise from a subtle bias in perception and associated brainactivity rather than decision-making processes, and that this bias developsrapidly and involuntarily as a consequence of group affiliation. Our findingssuggest that the neural mechanisms that underlie human perception are shaped bysocial context.
 Social emotions such as empathy or compassion greatly facilitate our interactionswith others. Despite the importance of social emotions, scientific studies haveonly recently revealed functional neural plasticity associated with the training of such emotions. Using the framework of two antagonistic neural systems, thethreat and social disconnection system on the one hand, and the reward and socialconnection system on the other, this article describes how training compassionand empathy can change the functioning of these systems in a targeted manner.Whereas excessive empathic sharing of suffering can increase negative feelingsand activations in the insula and anterior cingulate cortex (corresponding to thethreat and social disconnection system), compassion training can strengthenpositive affect and neural activations in the medial orbitofrontal cortex andstriatum (corresponding to the reward and social connection system). Theseneuroimaging findings are complemented by results from behavioral studies showingthat compassion is linked to helping and forgiveness behavior, whereas empathicdistress not only decreases helping behavior, but is even associated withincreased aggressive behavior. Taken together, these data provide encouragingevidence for the plasticity of adaptive social emotions with wide-rangingimplications for basic science and applied settings.
 The first decade of the twenty-first century was characterized by renewedscientific interest in self-generated mental activity (activity largely generatedby the individual, rather than in direct response to experimenters' instructions or specific external sensory inputs). To understand this renewal of interest, we interrogated the peer-reviewed literature from 2003 to 2012 (i) to explore recentchanges in use of terms for self-generated mental activity; (ii) to investigatechanges in the topics on which mind wandering research, specifically, focuses;and (iii) to visualize co-citation communities amongst researchers working onself-generated mental activity. Our analyses demonstrated that there has been adramatic increase in the term "mind wandering" from 2006, and a significantcrossing-over of psychological investigations of mind wandering into cognitiveneuroscience (particularly in relation to research on the default mode anddefault mode network). If our article concludes that this might, indeed, be the"era of the wandering mind," it also calls for more explicit reflection to begiven by researchers in this field to the terms they use, the topics and brainregions they focus on, and the research literatures that they implicitlyforeground or ignore.
 Regret-related brain activity is dependent on free choice, but it is unclearwhether this activity is a function of more subtle differences in the degree ofresponsibility a decision-maker exerts over a regrettable outcome. In thisexperiment, we show that trial-by-trial subjective ratings of regret depend on a higher subjective sense of responsibility, as well as being dependent onobjective responsibility. Using fMRI we show an enhanced amygdala response toregret-related outcomes when these outcomes are associated with high, as comparedto low, responsibility. This enhanced response was maximal in participants whoshowed a greater level of enhancement in their subjective ratings of regretengendered by an objective increase in responsibility. Orbitofrontal andcingulate cortex showed opposite effects, with an enhanced response forregret-related outcomes when participants were not objectively responsible. Thefindings indicate that the way the brain processes regret-related outcomesdepends on both objective and subjective aspects of responsibility, highlighting the critical importance of the amygdala.
 Suspiciousness is a common feature of schizophrenia. However, suspicious thoughtsare also commonly experienced by the general population. This study aimed toexamine the underlying neural mechanism of suspicious thoughts in individualswith and without schizotypal personality disorder (SPD)-proneness, using anevent-related potential (ERP) paradigm. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recordedwhen the "feeling of being seen through" was evoked in the participants. Thefindings showed a prominent positive deflection of the difference wave within thetime window 250-400 ms after stimuli presentation in both SPD-prone andnon-SPD-prone groups. Furthermore, the P3 amplitude was significantly reduced in the SPD-prone group compared to the non-SPD-prone group. The current densityanalysis also indicated hypoactivity in both frontal and temporal regions in the SPD-prone group, suggesting that the frontotemporal cortical network may play arole in the onset of suspicious thoughts. The P3 of difference wave was inverselycorrelated with the cognitive-perception factor and the suspiciousness/paranoidideation trait, which provided preliminary electrophysiological evidence for the association of suspiciousness with SPD features.
 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an early onset neurodevelopmental disordermarked by impairments in reciprocal social interaction, communication, and thepresence of repetitive or restricted interests and behaviors. Despite greatphenotypic heterogeneity and etiologic diversity in ASD, social dysfunction isthe unifying feature of ASD. This chapter focuses on understanding the neuralsystems involved in the processing of social information and its disruption inASD by reviewing the conceptual background and highlighting some recent advances.In addition, work investigating an alternative interpretation of autisticdysfunction, problems with interconnectivity, and consequent difficulties withcomplex information processing are addressed.
 The present study investigated whether and how self-construal priming influences empathic neural responses to others' emotional states. We recorded event-related brain potentials to stimuli depicting the hands of unknown others experiencingpainful or non-painful events from Chinese and Western participants after theyhad been primed in three conditions (independent self-construal priming,interdependent self-construal priming, and a control condition). Stimulidepicting painful events (as opposed to non-painful ones) elicited a positiveshift of the fronto-central activity at 232-332 ms and of the central-parietalactivity at 440-740 ms in the control condition. Moreover, neural responses tostimuli depicting painful (vs. non-painful) situations at 232-332 ms weredecreased by interdependent self-construal priming among Chinese and byindependent self-construal priming among Westerners. Our findings suggest thatself-construal priming modulates sensitivity to perceived pain in unknown others and that this effect varies with culture.
 The speed and ease with which we recognize the faces of our friends and familymembers belies the difficulty we have recognizing less familiar individuals.Nonetheless, overconfidence in our ability to recognize faces has carried overinto various aspects of our legal system; for instance, eyewitness identificationserves a critical role in criminal proceedings. For this reason, understandingthe perceptual and psychological processes that underlie false identification is of the utmost importance. Gaze direction is a salient social signal and directeye contact, in particular, is thought to capture attention. Here, we tested the hypothesis that differences in gaze direction may influence difficult decisionsin a lineup context. In a series of experiments, we show that when a group offaces differed in their gaze direction, the faces that were making eye contactwith the participants were more likely to be misidentified. Interestingly, thisbias disappeared when the faces are presented with their eyes closed. Thesefindings open a critical conversation between social neuroscience and forensicpsychology, and imply that direct eye contact may (wrongly) increase theperceived familiarity of a face.
 The importance of differentiating between social concepts when appraising actions(e.g., understanding behavior as critical vs. fault-finding) and its contributionto vulnerability to major depressive disorder (MDD) is unknown. We predicted poorintegration of differentiated conceptual knowledge when people with MDD appraise their social actions, contributing to their tendency to grossly overgeneralizeself-blame (e.g., "I am unlikable rather than critical"). To test thishypothesis, we used a neuropsychological test measuring social conceptualdifferentiation and its relationship with emotional biases in a remitted MDD and a control group. During fMRI, guilt- and indignation-evoking sentences werepresented. As predicted, conceptual overgeneralization was associated withincreased emotional intensity when appraising social actions. Interdependence of conceptual overgeneralization and negative emotional biases was stronger in MDD(reproducible in the subgroup without medication) and was associated withovergeneralized self-blame. This high conceptual-emotional interdependence wasassociated with functional disconnection between the right superior anteriortemporal lobe (ATL) and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) as well as aseptal region across groups when experiencing guilt (SPM8). Strong coupling ofconceptual information (ATL) with information about the context of actions andemotions (frontal-subcortical regions) is thus associated with appraisal beingless dependent on conceptual overgeneralization, thereby protecting againstexcessive self-blame.
 Numerous structural studies have established that experience shapes and reshapes the brain throughout a lifetime. The impact of early development, however, isstill a matter of debate. Further clues may come from studying multilinguals who acquired their second language at different ages. We investigated adultmultilinguals who spoke three languages fluently, where the third language waslearned in classroom settings, not before the age of 9 years. Multilingualsexposed to two languages simultaneously from birth (SiM) were contrasted withmultinguals who acquired their first two languages successively (SuM). Wholebrain voxel based morphometry revealed that, relative to SuM, SiM havesignificantly lower gray matter volume in several language-associated corticalareas in both hemispheres: bilaterally in medial and inferior frontal gyrus, inthe right medial temporal gyrus and inferior posterior parietal gyrus, as well asin the left inferior temporal gyrus. Thus, as shown by others, successivelanguage learning increases the volume of language-associated cortical areas. In brains exposed early on and simultaneously to more than one language, however,learning of additional languages seems to have less impact. We conclude that - atleast with respect to language acquisition - early developmental influences aremaintained and have an effect on experience-dependent plasticity well intoadulthood.
 BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated with empathydeficits. The exact nature of these deficits and their relation to concurrentalexithymia remain unknown. Here we tested under which conditions MDD patientswith high and low alexithymia show deficient empathy, particularly investigating empathic abilities when inhibition of self-related emotional states is needed andwhen it is not. METHODS: Healthy controls (low: n=28, high: n=14) and currentlydepressed MDD patients (low: n=11, high: n=18) with low or high alexithymiaperformed an emotional egocentricity paradigm based on tactile stimulation. This task measures empathic judgements, when emotional states of self and other differand inhibition of self-related emotional states is needed, and when they do notand thus empathic judgments can be based on simple projection mechanisms.RESULTS: Only alexithymia but not depression decreased empathy, in situationswhen simple projection sufficed. However, when inhibition of self-relatedemotional states was needed, MDD patients showed an egocentric bias duringempathic judgments and an altercentric bias during self emotion judgments, thelatter suggesting heightened emotional contagion, both independent ofalexithymia. Across the entire sample, alexithymia decreased the size of theegocentric bias. LIMITATIONS: This study was based on a relatively sample size.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MDD patients show intact empathicjudgments, when simple projection is required and no concurrent alexithymia ispresent. In situations when incongruent emotional states of self and other haveto be resolved, MDD patients are prone to egocentric and altercentric biases.
 Greater obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptom severity may be associated with poorsocial adjustment. Rather than possessing deficits in social skill per se, OCDpatients may be more socially isolative in the presence of normal controls. Weaimed to apply a novel social interaction challenge (SIC) to an establishedanimal model of OCD, viz., the deer mouse, to assess complex social behavior inanimals by investigating group sociability and its response to chronicescitalopram treatment (50 mg/kg/day x 28 days), both within and between non (N)-(viz., normal) and high (H)- (viz., OCD-like) stereotypical cohorts. Usingautomated screening, we scored approach behavior, episodes of proximity, durationof proximity, and relative net weighted movement. H animals socialized more with one another within cohort in all of the above parameters compared to thewithin-cohort behavior of N animals. Furthermore, the social behavior of Hanimals toward one another, both within and between cohort demonstratedsignificant improvements following chronic escitalopram treatment. However, thestudy also demonstrates that the social interaction between H and N animalsremain poor even after chronic escitalopram treatment. To conclude, findings fromthe current investigation support clinical data demonstrating altered sociabilityin patients with OCD.
 Previous research in social neuroscience has consistently shown that empathy for pain recruits brain areas that are also activated during the first-handexperience of pain. This has been interpreted as evidence that empathy reliesupon neural processes similar to those underpinning the first-hand experience of emotions. However, whether such overlapping neural activations imply thatequivalent neural functions are engaged by empathy and direct emotion experiencesremains to be demonstrated. We induced placebo analgesia, a phenomenonspecifically modulating the first-hand experience of pain, to test whether thisalso reduces empathy for pain. Subjective and neural measures of pain and empathyfor pain were collected using self-report and event-related potentials (ERPs)while participants underwent painful electrical stimulation or witnessed thatanother person was undergoing such stimulation. Self-report showed decreasedempathy during placebo analgesia, and this was mirrored by reduced amplitudes of the pain-related P2, an ERP component indexing neural computations related to theaffective-motivational component of pain. Moreover, these effects were specificfor pain, as self-report and ERP measures of control conditions unrelated to painwere not affected by placebo analgesia. Together, the present results suggestthat empathy seems to rely on neural processes that are (partially) functionally equivalent to those engaged by first-hand emotion experiences. Moreover, theyimply that analgesics may have the unwanted side effect of reducing empathicresonance and concern for others.
 The present study investigated the time course of processing other's pain underdifferent conditions of working memory (WM) load. Event-related potentials (ERPs)were recorded while the participants held two digits (low WM load) or six digits (high WM load) in WM and viewed pictures that showed others who were in painfulor non-painful situations. Robust WM-loadxPicture interactions were found for theN2 and LPP components. In the high WM-load condition, painful pictures elicitedsignificantly larger amplitudes than non-painful pictures. In the low WM loadcondition, the difference between the painful and non-painful pictures was notsignificant. These ERP results indicate that WM load can influence both the earlyautomatic N2 component and late cognitive LPP component. Compared with high WMload, low WM load reduced affective arousal and emotional sharing in response to other's pain and weakened the cognitive evaluation of task irrelevant stimuli.These findings are explained from the load theory perspective.
 Social support is an effective means by which people cope with stressful events, and consequently, it beneficially affects health and well-being. Yet there areprofound cultural differences in the effectiveness of different types of support and how people use their support networks. In this paper, we examine research on the impact of culture on social support, the neural underpinnings of socialsupport, and how cultural differences in social support seeking are manifestedbiologically. We focus on cultural factors that may affect individuals' decisionsto seek or not to seek social support and how culture moderates the impact ofsupport seeking on biological and psychological health outcomes. We also examine recent research on the interaction between genes and culture in social supportuse. Discussion centers on the importance of developing an overarching framework of social support that integrates health psychology, cultural psychology, social neuroscience, and genetics.
 Exclusionary social events are known to cause alterations in neural activity and attention-related processes. However, the precise nature of these neuraladjustments remains unknown as previous research has been limited to examiningsocial interactions and exclusionary events as unitary phenomena. To address thislimitation, we assessed neural activity during both inclusionary and exclusionarysocial interactions by examining event-related brain potentials at multiplepoints within each social event. Our results show an initial enhancement ofanterior cingulate cortex -related activation, indexed by the anterior N2, inresponse to specific exclusionary events followed by an enhanced attentionalorienting response, indexed by the P3a, to later segments of each exclusionaryevent. Decreases in this P3a activation from social inclusion to social exclusionwere associated with self-reported increases in anxiety, negative affect, andfeelings of depression from inclusion to exclusion. Together, these findingsprovide novel insights into the dynamic and ongoing neural processes associatedwith attentional allocation toward social exclusion and the nature of therelationships between neural and behavioral reactions to exclusionary socialinteractions.
 Neuroscience, by its nature, seems to hold considerable promise for understandingthe fundamental mechanisms of decision making. In recent years, several studiesin the domain of "neuroeconomics" or "decision neuroscience" have providedimportant insights into brain function. Yet, the apparent success and value ofeach of these domains are frequently called into question by researchers ineconomics and behavioral decision making. Critics often charge that knowledgeabout the brain is unnecessary for understanding decision preferences. In thischapter, I contend that knowledge about underlying brain mechanisms helps in the development of biologically plausible models of behavior, which can then helpelucidate the mechanisms underlying individual choice biases and strategicpreferences. Using a novel risky choice paradigm, I will demonstrate that people vary in whether they adopt compensatory or noncompensatory rules in economicdecision making. Importantly, neuroimaging studies using functional magneticresonance imaging reveal that distinct neural mechanisms support variability inchoices and variability in strategic preferences. Converging evidence from astudy involving decisions between hypothetical stocks illustrates how knowledgeabout the underlying mechanisms can help inform neuroanatomical models ofcognitive control. Last, I will demonstrate how knowledge about these underlying neural mechanisms can provide novel insights into the effects of decision states like sleep deprivation on decision preferences. Together, these findings suggest that neuroscience can play a critical role in creating robust and flexible modelsof real-world decision behavior.
 Autism is a complex disorder, characterized by social, cognitive, communicative, and motor symptoms. One suggestion, proposed in the current study, to explain thespectrum of symptoms is an underlying impairment in multisensory integration(MSI) systems such as a mirror neuron-like system. The mirror neuron system,thought to play a critical role in skills such as imitation, empathy, andlanguage can be thought of as a multisensory system, converting sensory stimuliinto motor representations. Consistent with this, we report preliminary evidence for deficits in a task thought to tap into MSI--"the bouba-kiki task" in childrenwith ASD. The bouba-kiki effect is produced when subjects are asked to pairnonsense shapes with nonsense "words". We found that neurotypical children chose the nonsense "word" whose phonemic structure corresponded with the visual shapeof the stimuli 88% of the time. This is presumably because of mirror neuron-like multisensory systems that integrate the visual shape with the corresponding motorgestures used to pronounce the nonsense word. Surprisingly, individuals with ASD only chose the corresponding name 56% of the time. The poor performance by theASD group on this task suggests a deficit in MSI, perhaps related to impaired MSIbrain systems. Though this is a behavioral study, it provides a testablehypothesis for the communication impairments in children with ASD that implicatesa specific neural system and fits well with the current findings suggesting animpairment in the mirror systems in individuals with ASD.
 Perceiving the pain of others activates similar neural structures to thoseinvolved in the direct experience of pain, including sensory andaffective-motivational areas. Empathic responses can be modulated by race, suchthat stronger neural activation is elicited by the perception of pain in peopleof the same race compared with another race. In the present study, we aimed toidentify when racial bias occurs in the time course of neural empathic responses to pain. We also investigated whether group affiliation could modulate the raceeffect. Using the minimal group paradigm, we assigned participants to one of two mixed-race teams. We examined event-related potentials from participants whenviewing members of their own and the other team receiving painful or non-painful touch. We identified a significant racial bias in early ERP components at N1 overfrontal electrodes, where Painful stimuli elicited a greater negative shiftrelative to Non-Painful stimuli in response to own race faces only. A longlatency empathic response was also found at P3, where there was significantdifferentiation between Painful and Non-Painful stimuli regardless of Race orGroup. There was no evidence that empathy-related brain activity was modulated byminimal group manipulation. These results support a model of empathy for painthat consists of early, automatic bias towards own-race empathic responses and a later top-down cognitive evaluation that does not differentiate between races andmay ultimately lead to unbiased behaviour.
 The neuropeptide oxytocin is part of a neuroendocrine system that hasphysiological effects ranging from ensuring uterine myometrial contractions atparturition and post-partum mammary gland milk ejection to the modulation ofneural control of social relationships. This initial study was performed toinvestigate the potential use of positron emission tomography (PET) forlocalizing oxytocin receptors in two New World primates. Three biomarkers for PET(1-3) that are known to have high affinity and selectivity for the human oxytocinreceptor were investigated in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) via PETimaging. Brain penetration, and uptake in the salivary gland area were bothobserved with biomarkers 2 and 3. No brain penetration was observed with 1, butuptake was observed more specifically in several peripheral endocrine glandscompared to 2 or 3. Biomarker 2, which displayed the best brain penetration ofthe three biomarkers in the marmoset, was then investigated in the monogamouscoppery titi monkey (Callicebus cupreus) in a brain scan and a limited full body scan. No significant brain penetration of 2 was observed in the titi monkey, but significant uptake was observed in various locations throughout the periphery.Metabolism of 2 was suspected to have been significant based upon HPLC analysisof blood draws, but parent compound was still present near the end of the scan.Follow-up investigations will focus on next generation biomarkers bearingimproved binding characteristics and brain penetrability as well as investigatingtissue in regions where biomarker uptake was observed.
 Prejudice is an enduring and pervasive aspect of human cognition. An emergenttrend in modern psychology has focused on understanding how cognition is linkedto neural function, leading researchers to investigate the neural correlates ofprejudice. Research in this area using racial group memberships has quicklyhighlighted the amygdala as a neural structure of importance. In this article, weoffer a critical review of social neuroscientific studies of the amygdala inrace-related prejudice. Rather than the dominant interpretation that amygdalaactivity reflects a racial or outgroup bias per se, we argue that the observedpattern of sensitivity in this literature is best considered in terms ofpotential threat. More specifically, we argue that negative culturally-learnedassociations between black males and potential threat better explain the observedpattern of amygdala activity. Finally, we consider future directions for thefield and offer specific experiments and predictions to directly addressunanswered questions.
 Thirty years ago, grounded cognition had roots in philosophy, perception,cognitive linguistics, psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, and cognitiveneuropsychology. During the next 20 years, grounded cognition continueddeveloping in these areas, and it also took new forms in robotics, cognitiveecology, cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychology. In the past 10years, research on grounded cognition has grown rapidly, especially in cognitive neuroscience, social neuroscience, cognitive psychology, social psychology, anddevelopmental psychology. Currently, grounded cognition appears to be achievingincreased acceptance throughout cognitive science, shifting from relatively minorstatus to increasing importance. Nevertheless, researchers wonder whethergrounded mechanisms lie at the heart of the cognitive system or are peripheral toclassic symbolic mechanisms. Although grounded cognition is currently dominatedby demonstration experiments in the absence of well-developed theories, the area is likely to become increasingly theory driven over the next 30 years. Anotherlikely development is the increased incorporation of grounding mechanisms intocognitive architectures and into accounts of classic cognitive phenomena. As thisincorporation occurs, much functionality of these architectures and phenomena is likely to remain, along with many original mechanisms. Future theories ofgrounded cognition are likely to be heavily influenced by both cognitiveneuroscience and social neuroscience, and also by developmental science androbotics. Aspects from the three major perspectives in cognitive science-classic symbolic architectures, statistical/dynamical systems, and groundedcognition-will probably be integrated increasingly in future theories, eachcapturing indispensable aspects of intelligence.
 Parents know the transformative nature of having and caring for a child. Amongmany mammals, giving birth leads from an aversion to infant stimuli toirresistible attraction. Here, we review the biological mechanisms governing thisshift in parental motivation in mammals. Estrogen and progesterone prepare theuterus for embryo implantation and placental development. Prolactin stimulatesmilk production, whereas oxytocin initiates labor and triggers milk ejectionduring nursing. These same molecules, interacting with dopamine, also activatespecific neural pathways to motivate parents to nurture, bond with, and protecttheir offspring. Parenting in turn shapes the neural development of the infantsocial brain. Recent work suggests that many of the principles governing parentalbehavior and its effect on infant development are conserved from rodent tohumans.
 The developmental origin of sex differences in adult brain function is poorlyunderstood. Elucidating neural mechanisms underlying comparable cognitivefunctionality in both children and adults is required to address this gap. Humor appreciation represents a particularly relevant target for such developmentalresearch because explanatory theories apply across the life span, and underlying neurocircuitry shows sex differences in adults. As a positive mood state, humoris also of interest due to sex differences in rates of depression, a disorderafflicting twice as many women as men. In this study, we employed functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate brain responses to funny versus positive (and neutral) video clips in 22 children, ages 6-13 years, includingeight sibling-pairs. Our data revealed increased activity to funny clips inbilateral temporo-occipital cortex, midbrain, and amygdala in girls. Conversely, we found heightened activation to positive clips in bilateral inferior parietallobule, fusiform gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, amygdala, and ventromedialprefrontal cortex in boys. Many of these effects persisted when looking atsibling-pairs only. We interpret such findings as reflecting the presence ofearly sex divergence in reward saliency or expectation and stimulus relevanceattribution. These findings are discussed in the context of evolutionary anddevelopmental theories of humor function.
 Social exclusion often evokes social pain in excluded individuals. Although this pain can trigger various interpersonal difficulties (e.g., aggression,depression), it is still unclear which psychological approach might best help to regulate social pain. However, recent work suggests that temporal distance helps to facilitate adaptive coping and self-control. The present study measuredventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) activity during social exclusion, usingnear-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to examine the functional relationship between "temporal distance approach," or thinking about the distant future, and thesocial pain regulation process. Participants that imagined the distant future,next year, and beyond, felt less social pain and showed increased right (r)VLPFC activity during social exclusion, as compared to imagining events in the nearfuture, such as tonight and tomorrow. Furthermore, rVLPFC activity mediated therelationship between temporal distance and social pain. On the basis of thesefindings, the effect of temporal distance on the process of adaptation aftersocial exclusion is discussed. It is suggested that temporal distance moderatesthe process of regulating the impact of social exclusion.
 Humans tend to use the self as a reference point to perceive the world and gaininformation about other people's mental states. However, applying such aself-referential projection mechanism in situations where it is inappropriate canresult in egocentrically biased judgments. To assess egocentricity bias in theemotional domain (EEB), we developed a novel visuo-tactile paradigm assessing thedegree to which empathic judgments are biased by one's own emotions if they areincongruent to those of the person we empathize with. A first behavioralexperiment confirmed the existence of such EEB, and two independent fMRIexperiments revealed that overcoming biased empathic judgments is associated withincreased activation in the right supramarginal gyrus (rSMG), in a locationdistinct from activations in right temporoparietal junction reported in previous social cognition studies. Using temporary disruption of rSMG with repetitivetranscranial magnetic stimulation resulted in a substantial increase of EEB, and so did reducing visuo-tactile stimulation time as shown in an additionalbehavioral experiment. Our findings provide converging evidence from multiplemethods and experiments that rSMG is crucial for overcoming emotionalegocentricity. Effective connectivity analyses suggest that this may be achieved by early perceptual regulation processes disambiguating proprioceptivefirst-person information (touch) from exteroceptive third-person information(vision) during incongruency between self- and other-related affective states.Our study extends previous models of social cognition. It shows that althoughshared neural networks may underlie emotional understanding in some situations,an additional mechanism subserved by rSMG is needed to avoid biased socialjudgments in other situations.
 The study examines the prevalence of deja vu in healthy Czech adults and exploresits relationships with a number of variables: age, sex, neuroticism, depression, the degree of irritability in the limbic system, perceived stress, and finallyattachment avoidance and anxiety. The participants were 365 healthy adultsranging from 18 to 70 years recruited in the Czech Republic (mean age = 29.05; SD= 11.17) who filled out online questionnaires. Deja vu experiences were reported by 324 (88.8%) of them. Persons who experienced deja vu were younger than thepersons who had not experienced it. We found that sex, levels of neuroticism,depression, perceived stress, and attachment did not serve as predictors ofexperiences of deja vu phenomena. Finally, those who had reported deja vuexperiences reported more limbic system irritability symptoms. We discuss thepossibility that deja vu reports together with other studied variables mainlyreflect the participants' willingness to report "extraordinal" experiences.
 As society becomes more reliant on machines and automation, understanding howpeople utilize advice is a necessary endeavor. Our objective was to reveal theunderlying neural associations during advice utilization from expert human andmachine agents with fMRI and multivariate Granger causality analysis. During anX-ray luggage-screening task, participants accepted or rejected good or badadvice from either the human or machine agent framed as experts with manipulated reliability (high miss rate). We showed that the machine-agent group decreasedtheir advice utilization compared to the human-agent group and these differences in behaviors during advice utilization could be accounted for by highexpectations of reliable advice and changes in attention allocation due to misserrors. Brain areas involved with the salience and mentalizing networks, as well as sensory processing involved with attention, were recruited during the task andthe advice utilization network consisted of attentional modulation of sensoryinformation with the lingual gyrus as the driver during the decision phase andthe fusiform gyrus as the driver during the feedback phase. Our findings expandon the existing literature by showing that misses degrade advice utilization,which is represented in a neural network involving salience detection andself-processing with perceptual integration.
 Engaging in prosocial behavior was explored in the present research, byinvestigating the role of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in modulation ofintention to support other people and of emotional attuning as it was expressedby facial feedback (electromiography, EMG). High-frequency rTMS was applied onDLPFC to 25 subjects when they were required to choose to directly intervene ornot to support other people in emotionally valenced social situations(cooperative, noncooperative, conflictual, neutral contexts). Two controlconditions were included in the experimental design to control the simplestimulation effect (sham condition with absence of TMS stimulation) and thelocation effect (control site condition with Pz stimulation). In comparison with sham and control condition, rTMS stimulation induced increased prosocial behaviorin all the emotional situations. Moreover, as a function of valence, zygomatic(for positive situations) and corrugators (for negative situations) muscleactivity was increased, with significant effect by DLPFC stimulation whichinduced a "facilitation effect". In addition, negative situations showed a higherrTMS impact for both behavioral and EMG responsiveness. Finally, prosocialbehavior was found to be predicted (regression analysis) by EMG variations, as a function of the negative versus positive valence. The prefrontal circuit wassuggested to support emotional responsiveness and facial feedback in order tofacilitate the prosocial behavior.
 Social monogamy is a mating strategy rarely employed by mammalian species.Laboratory studies in socially monogamous prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster)demonstrate that oxytocin and vasopressin act within the mesolimbic dopaminepathway to facilitate pair-bond formation. Species differences in oxytocinreceptor (OTR) and vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) distribution in this pathwayare associated with species differences in mating strategy. Here we characterize the neuroanatomical distribution of OTR and V1aR binding sites in naturallyoccurring populations of Taiwan voles (M. kikuchii), which purportedly displaysocial monogamy. Live trapping was conducted at two sites in 2009-2010 andreceptor autoradiography for OTR and V1aR was performed on brains from 24animals. OTR binding in two brain regions where OTR signaling regulatespair-bonding were directly compared with that of prairie voles. Our results show that like prairie voles, Taiwan voles exhibit OTR in the prefrontal cortex,insular cortex, claustrum, nucleus accumbens, caudate-putamen, dorsal lateralseptal nucleus, central amygdala, and ventromedial hypothalamus. Unlike prairievoles, Taiwan voles exhibit OTR binding in the CA3 pathway of the hippocampus, aswell as the indusium griseum, which has only previously been documented intuco-tucos (Ctenomys haigi, C. sociabilis), Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetusauratus) and naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber). V1aR binding was present inthe ventral pallidum, lateral septum, nucleus basalis, bed nucleus of the striaterminalis, hippocampus, medial amygdala, and anterior, ventromedial anddorsomedial hypothalamus. Marked individual differences in V1aR binding werenoted in the cingulate cortex and several thalamic nuclei, remarkably similar to prairie voles. While pharmacological studies are needed to determine whetheroxytocin and vasopressin are involved in pair-bond formation in this species, ourresults lay a foundation for future investigations into the role of theseneuropeptides in Taiwan vole social behavior.
 Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrate difficulty withsocial interactions and relationships, but the neural mechanisms underlying thesedifficulties remain largely unknown. While social difficulties in ASD are mostapparent in the context of interactions with other people, most neuroscienceresearch investigating ASD have provided limited insight into the complexdynamics of these interactions. The development of novel, innovative "interactivesocial neuroscience" methods to study the brain in contexts with two interacting humans is a necessary advance for ASD research. Studies applying an interactiveneuroscience approach to study two brains engaging with one another have revealedsignificant differences in neural processes during interaction compared toobservation in brain regions that are implicated in the neuropathology of ASD.Interactive social neuroscience methods are crucial in clarifying the mechanisms underlying the social and communication deficits that characterize ASD.
 Humans are social beings and often have to perceive and perform within groups. Inconflict situations, this puts them under pressure to either adhere to the group opinion or to risk controversy with the group. Psychological experiments havedemonstrated that study participants adapt to erroneous group opinions in visual perception tasks, which they can easily solve correctly when performing on their own. Until this point, however, it is unclear whether this phenomenon of socialconformity influences early stages of perception that might not even reachawareness or later stages of conscious decision-making. Usingelectroencephalography, this study has revealed that social conformity to thewrong group opinion resulted in a decrease of the posterior-lateral P1 in linewith a decrease of the later centro-parietal P3. These results suggest that grouppressure situations impact early unconscious visual perceptual processing, which results in a later diminished stimulus discrimination and an adaptation even tothe wrong group opinion. These findings might have important implications forunderstanding social behavior in group settings and are discussed within theframework of social influence on eyewitness testimony.
 Human interaction often requires simultaneous precision and flexibility in thecoordination of rhythmic behaviour between individuals engaged in joint activity,for example, playing a musical duet or dancing with a partner. This reviewarticle addresses the psychological processes and brain mechanisms that enablesuch rhythmic interpersonal coordination. First, an overview is given of researchon the cognitive-motor processes that enable individuals to represent jointaction goals and to anticipate, attend and adapt to other's actions in real time.Second, the neurophysiological mechanisms that underpin rhythmic interpersonalcoordination are sought in studies of sensorimotor and cognitive processes thatplay a role in the representation and integration of self- and other-relatedactions within and between individuals' brains. Finally, relationships betweensocial-psychological factors and rhythmic interpersonal coordination areconsidered from two perspectives, one concerning how social-cognitive tendencies (e.g. empathy) affect coordination, and the other concerning how coordinationaffects interpersonal affiliation, trust and prosocial behaviour. Our reviewhighlights musical ensemble performance as an ecologically valid yet readilycontrolled domain for investigating rhythm in joint action.
 The field of social neuroscience has made remarkable progress in elucidating the neural mechanisms of social cognition. More recently, the need for newexperimental approaches has been highlighted that allow studying socialencounters in a truly interactive manner by establishing 'online' reciprocity in social interaction. In this article, we present a newly developed adaptation of amethod which uses eyetracking data obtained from participants in real time tocontrol visual stimulation during functional magnetic resonance imaging, thus,providing an innovative tool to generate gaze-contingent stimuli in spite of the constraints of this experimental setting. We review results of two paradigmsemploying this technique and demonstrate how gaze data can be used to animate avirtual character whose behavior becomes 'responsive' to being looked at allowingthe participant to engage in 'online' interaction with this virtual other inreal-time. Possible applications of this setup are discussed highlighting thepotential of this development as a new 'tool of the trade' in social cognitiveand affective neuroscience.
 Intact social memory forms the basis of meaningful interactions betweenindividuals. Many factors can modulate the quality of social memory, and thesehave been studied in detail in rodents. Social memory, however, cannot beconsidered a single entity. The term social memory reflects different processes, such as social recognition of a novel conspecific individual and social learning (or 'learning from others'). This review summarizes the findings obtained withbehavioral paradigms that were developed for the study of memory formation bysocial recognition and social learning. In particular, we focus on studies thatinclude tests for social habituation/discrimination paradigms, tests for memoryof a previously established social hierarchy and the social transmission of thefood preference test. The role of individual differences and the mainneurobiological mechanisms (i.e., the brain regions and neurochemical systemsinvolved) that have been implicated in each of these types of social-relatedmemories are reviewed. In addition, we address the key modulatory influence ofstress on the formation of these types of memories; discussing the contributionof central (corticotropin-releasing factor, CRF) and peripheral (glucocorticoids)stress systems and their interactions with the social neuropeptide systems.Overall, we present here a general overview of the current state of a thrivingresearch area within the field of social neuroscience.
 Patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) exhibit a set ofbehavioral disturbances that have been strongly associated with involvement ofthe prefrontal cortex (PFC). Many such disturbances have been linked to impaired moral behavior, especially in regard to "personal" or "emotionally driven" moral dilemmatic judgment, which has been demonstrated to also depend on the integrity of the PFC. In this study, we administered a personal moral dilemma (thefootbridge dilemma) and social cognition measures to patients with early bvFTD,who were also assessed with an extensive neuropsychological battery, includingmoral knowledge, cognitive and emotional empathy, and affective decision-making. BvFTD patients who would push a man off a footbridge (knowing this would killhim) to save the life of five workers who would have been otherwise killed by thetrain showed significantly lower scores on affective Theory of Mind (ToM)relative to those bvFTD patients who responded negatively. No significantdifferences were found on other sociodemographic, neuropsychological or socialcognition variables. This study reveals that altered dilemmatic judgment may berelated to impaired affective ToM, which has important clinical and theoreticalimplications.
 Faces are a developmentally primary and critically important source of socialinformation, and they are processed differently from most other visual percepts. Studies of brain electrophysiology reveal a face-sensitive component, the N170,which is typically enhanced to faces relative to other stimuli. Research insocial disabilities suggests that an atypical N170 response in this populationmay stem from decreased developmental exposure to faces secondary to reducedsocial interest. Here we examined the relationship between neural responses tofaces and social personality characteristics in a normative sample. Participants were pre-screened to identify individuals scoring high on extraversion orintroversion. Both groups were presented with upright and inverted face stimuli. An inversion effect, a marker of expertise for faces, was observed in people withhigh extraversion but not in those with high introversion. These findings suggestthat, within typically developing populations, social attitudes are reflected in the neural correlates of face perception.
 The ability to make accurate judgments about the mental states of others,sometimes referred to as theory of mind (ToM), is often impaired followingtraumatic brain injury (TBI), and this deficit may contribute to problems withinterpersonal relationships. The present study used an animated socialattribution task (SAT) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) toexamine structures mediating ToM in adolescents with moderate to severe TBI. The study design also included a comparison group of matched, typically developing(TD) adolescents. The TD group exhibited activation within a number of areas thatare thought to be relevant to ToM, including the medial prefrontal and anteriorcingulate cortex, fusiform gyrus, and posterior temporal and parietal areas. The TBI subjects had significant activation within many of these same areas, buttheir activation was generally more intense and excluded the medial prefrontalcortex. Exploratory regression analyses indicated a negative relation betweenToM-related activation and measures of white matter integrity derived fromdiffusion tensor imaging, while there was also a positive relation betweenactivation and lesion volume. These findings are consistent with alterations inthe level and pattern of brain activation that may be due to the combinedinfluence of diffuse axonal injury and focal lesions.
 Since the first demonstration of how to simultaneously measure brain activityusing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on two subjects about 10 yearsago, a new paradigm in neuroscience is emerging: measuring brain activity fromtwo or more people simultaneously, termed "hyperscanning". The hyperscanningapproach has the potential to reveal inter-personal brain mechanisms underlyinginteraction-mediated brain-to-brain coupling. These mechanisms are engaged duringreal social interactions, and cannot be captured using single-subject recordings.In particular, functional near-infrared imaging (fNIRI) hyperscanning is apromising new method, offering a cost-effective, easy to apply and reliabletechnology to measure inter-personal interactions in a natural context. In thisshort review we report on fNIRI hyperscanning studies published so far andsummarize opportunities and challenges for future studies.
 Advances in cognitive, affective, and social neuroscience raise a host of newquestions concerning the ways in which neuroscience can and should be used. Theseadvances also challenge our intuitions about the nature of humans as moral andspiritual beings. Neuroethics is the new field that grapples with these issues.The present article surveys a number of applications of neuroscience to suchdiverse arenas as marketing, criminal justice, the military, and workerproductivity. The ethical, legal, and societal effects of these applications are discussed. Less practical, but perhaps ultimately more consequential, is theimpact of neuroscience on our worldview and our understanding of the humanperson.
 We have previously shown that a right inferior frontal mirror neuron area forgrasping responds differently to observed grasping actions embedded in contextsthat suggest different intentions, such as drinking and cleaning (Iacoboni,Molnar-Szakacs, Gallese, Buccino, Mazziotta, & Rizzolatti, 2005). Informationabout intentions, however, may be conveyed also by the grasping action itself:for instance, people typically drink by grasping the handle of a cup with aprecision grip. In this fMRI experiment, subjects watched precision grips andwhole-hand prehensions embedded in a drinking or an eating context. Indeed, inthe right inferior frontal mirror neuron area there was higher activity forobserved precision grips in the drinking context. Signal changes in the rightinferior frontal mirror neuron area were also significantly correlated withscores on Empathic Concern subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, ameasure of emotional empathy. These data suggest that human mirror neuron areasuse both contextual and grasping type information to predict the intentions ofothers. They also suggest that mirror neuron activity is strongly linked tosocial competence.
 Two hypotheses were tested using a novel individual differences approach, whichidentifies rate-limiting brain regions, that is, brain regions in whichvariations in neural activity predict variations in behavioral performance. Thefirst hypothesis is that the rate-limiting regions that support the production oflies about oneself (self-related) are partially distinct from those underlyingthe production of lies about other individuals (other-related). The secondhypothesis is that a cingulate-insular-prefrontal network found to berate-limiting for interference tasks is involved in both types of lies. Theresults confirmed both hypotheses and supported the utility of this individualdifferences approach in the study of deception in particular, as well in thestudy of complex cognitive phenomena more generally.
 Compassion is a human feeling towards an individual who is suffering. However,the responses toward a victim are not always compassionate and may, for example, be moderated by the perceived responsibility of the victim. In the present study,we investigated the neural correlates of compassion and specificallydifferentiated the responses to other individuals' misfortunes depending onwhether the victim was responsible for the event that occurred. In particular, weidentified increased activation of the left insula, medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC), and adjacent anterior cingulate cortex when the participants readsentences with innocent compared with responsible victims. The reverse contrastrevealed increased activation of the bilateral temporoparietal junction, rightprecuneus, and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Using apsycho-physiological interaction (PPI) analysis, we demonstrated that in theresponsible condition, right dlPFC activation was accompanied by decreasedactivation in the left insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and mPFC. Thisinverse effective connectivity illustrates the antagonism of the dlPFC and mPFCin compassion-related appraisal of external events. More specifically, ourresults imply that regulatory mechanisms of compassion are related to theperception of responsibility.
 How do people consider other minds during cooperation versus competition? Someaccounts predict that theory of mind (ToM) is recruited more for cooperationversus competition or competition versus cooperation, whereas other accountspredict similar recruitment across these two contexts. The present fMRI studyexamined activity in brain regions for ToM (bilateral temporoparietal junction,precuneus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) across cooperative and competitiveinteractions with the same individual within the same paradigm. Althoughunivariate analyses revealed that ToM regions overall were recruited similarlyacross interaction contexts, multivariate pattern analyses revealed that theseregions nevertheless encoded information separating cooperation from competition.Specifically, ToM regions encoded differences between cooperation and competitionwhen people believed the outcome was determined by their and their partner'schoices but not when the computer determined the outcome. We propose that, whenpeople are motivated to consider others' mental states, ToM regions encodedifferent aspects of mental states during cooperation versus competition. Giventhe role of these regions for ToM, these findings reveal distinct patterns ofsocial cognition for distinct motivational contexts.
 Accumulating evidence from social neuroscience demonstrates that the medialprefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a crucial component of the neural systems mediatingsocial event knowledge. Here, we present an integrative theory of the cognitiveand neural bases of social event knowledge. The structural and temporalrepresentation binding (STRing) theory assumes that the mPFC represents abstract dynamic summary representations in the form of event simulators (elators).Elators give rise to social event knowledge via binding with regions in theposterior cerebral cortex and limbic structures. We propose a segregation ofelator functions along the dorso-ventral mPFC axis and review neuroscienceevidence to support the specificity of elators as the underlying structures forthe development of event, person and self schemata.
 Recent work from our interdisciplinary research group has revealed the emergence of inter-brain synchronization across multiple frequency bands during socialinteraction.1 Our findings result from the close collaboration between expertswho study neural dynamics and developmental psychology. The initial aim of thecollaboration was to combine knowledge from these two fields in order to movefrom a classical one-brain neuroscience towards a novel two-body approach. A new technique called hyperscanning has made it possible to study the neural activity of two individuals simultaneously. However, this advanced methodology was notsufficient in itself. What remained to be found was a way to promote real-timereciprocal social interaction between two individuals during brain recording and analyze the neural and behavioral phenomenon from an inter-individualperspective. Approaches used in infancy research to study nonverbal communicationand coordination, between a mother and her child for example, have so far beenpoorly applied to neuroimaging experiments. We thus adapted an ecologicaltwo-body experiment inspired by the use of spontaneous imitation in preverbalinfants. Numerous methodological and theoretical problems had to be overcome,ranging from the choice of a common time-unit for behavioral and brain recordingsto the creation of algorithms for data processing between distant brain regionsin different brains. This article will discuss the underlying issues andperspectives involved in elucidating the pathway from individual to socialtheories of cognition.
 Stress is a major health burden in today's society. Research shows that negative cognitive styles are associated with increased stress reactivity, low mood andaccelerated cellular aging. Our study sought to unravel the relationship between the content of self-generated thoughts and psychosocial stress measured in terms of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic activity. Features ofself-generated thoughts were assessed using thought sampling while participantsperformed cognitive tasks following a stress induction or in a baselinecondition. More negatively toned emotional thoughts and more social temporalthoughts with a past focus were associated with increased cortisol andalpha-amylase levels, both after stress and at baseline. More social temporalthoughts with a future focus, on the other hand, had an overall attenuatingeffect on the levels of both stress markers. Our results indicate a fundamentallink between the thoughts and stress levels we experience. Understanding themechanisms governing this mind-body association may have important implicationsfor understanding and counteracting the high incidence of stress-relateddisorders in today's society.
 BACKGROUND: While fluid intelligence has proved to be central to executivefunctioning, logical reasoning and other frontal functions, the role of thisability in psychosocial adaptation has not been well characterized.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A random-probabilistic sample of 2370 secondaryschool students completed measures of fluid intelligence (Raven's ProgressiveMatrices, RPM) and several measures of psychological adaptation: bullying(Delaware Bullying Questionnaire), domestic abuse of adolescents (Conflict TacticScale), drug intake (ONUDD), self-esteem (Rosenberg's Self Esteem Scale) and the Perceived Mental Health Scale (Spanish adaptation). Lower fluid intelligencescores were associated with physical violence, both in the role of victim andvictimizer. Drug intake, especially cannabis, cocaine and inhalants and lowerself-esteem were also associated with lower fluid intelligence. Finally, scoreson the perceived mental health assessment were better when fluid intelligencescores were higher. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show evidence of astrong association between psychosocial adaptation and fluid intelligence,suggesting that the latter is not only central to executive functioning but also forms part of a more general capacity for adaptation to social contexts.
 Much research has been carried out to understand how human brains make sense ofanother agent in motion. Current views based on human adult and monkey studiesassume a matching process in the motor system biased toward actions performed by conspecifics and present in the observer's motor repertoire. However, little isknown about the neural correlates of action cognition in early ontogeny. In this study, we examined the processes involved in the observation of full bodymovements in 4-month-old infants using functional near-infrared spectroscopy tomeasure localized brain activation. In a 2 x 2 design, infants watched human orrobotic figures moving in a smooth, familiar human-like manner, or in a rigid,unfamiliar robot-like manner. We found that infant premotor cortex responded morestrongly to observe robot-like motion compared with human-like motion. Contraryto current views, this suggests that the infant motor system is flexibly engaged by novel movement patterns. Moreover, temporal cortex responses indicate thatinfants integrate information about form and motion during action observation.The response patterns obtained in premotor and temporal cortices during actionobservation in these young infants are very similar to those reported for adults.These findings thus suggest that the brain processes involved in the analysis of an agent in motion in adults become functionally specialized very early in human development.
 Instances of altruism in children are well documented. However, the underlyingmechanisms of such altruistic behavior are still under considerable debate. Whilesome claim that altruistic acts occur automatically and spontaneously, othersargue that they require behavioral control. This study focuses on the mechanisms that give rise to prosocial decisions such as sharing and costly punishment. Intwo studies it is shown in 124 children aged 6-9 years that behavioral controlplays a critical role for both prosocial decisions and costly punishment.Specifically, the studies assess the influence of taxing aspects ofself-regulation, such as behavioral control (Study 1) and emotion regulation(Study 2) on subsequent decisions in a Dictator and an Ultimatum Game. Further,children's perception of fairness norms and emotional experience were measured.Taxing children's behavioral control prior to making their decisions reducedsharing and costly punishment of unfair offers, without changing perception offairness norms or the emotional experience. Conversely, taxing children's emotionregulation prior to making their decisions only led to increased experience ofanger at seeing unfair offers, but left sharing, costly punishment and theperception of fairness norms unchanged. These findings stress the critical roleof behavioral control in prosocial giving and costly punishment in childhood.
 The intention behind another's action and the impact of the outcome are majordeterminants of human economic behavior. It is poorly understood, however,whether the two systems share a core neural computation. Here, we investigatedwhether the two systems are causally dissociable in the brain by integratingcomputational modeling, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and transcranialdirect current stimulation experiments in a newly developed trust game task. Weshow not only that right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity iscorrelated with intention-based economic decisions and that ventral striatum and amygdala activity are correlated with outcome-based decisions, but also thatstimulation to the DLPFC selectively enhances intention-based decisions. Thesefindings suggest that the right DLPFC is involved in the implementation ofintention-based decisions in the processing of cooperative decisions. This causaldissociation of cortical and subcortical backgrounds may indicate evolutionaryand developmental differences in the two decision systems.
 This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study explored the neuralsubstrates of cognitive dissonance during dissonance "induction." A novel taskwas developed based on the results of a separate item selection study (n = 125). Items were designed to generate dissonance by prompting participants to reflecton everyday personal experiences that were inconsistent with values they hadexpressed support for. One experimental condition (dissonance) and three control conditions (justification, consonance, and non-self-related inconsistency) wereused for comparison. Items of all four types were presented to each participant(n = 14) in a randomized design. The fMRI analysis used a whole-brain approachfocusing on the moments dissonance was induced. Results showed that in comparisonwith the control conditions the dissonance experience led to higher levels ofactivation in several brain regions. Specifically dissonance was associated with increased neural activation in key brain regions including the anterior cingulatecortex (ACC), anterior insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and precuneus. Thissupports current perspectives that emphasize the role of anterior cingulate andinsula in dissonance processing. Less extensive activation in the prefrontalcortex than in some previous studies is consistent with this study's emphasis on dissonance induction, rather than reduction. This article also contains a shortreview and comparison with other fMRI studies of cognitive dissonance.
 Social context affects brain function but our understanding of its neurobiologyis at an early stage. The mere presence of one individual can alter the cognitivecapacities of another and social learning has been demonstrated in many species, including the mouse. We asked several questions: 1. How can active engagement of two familiar mice in the same learning activity (co-learning) alter their memory?2. Under which environmental conditions (aversive vs non-aversive) can we expect the memory to be enhanced, impaired, or not affected? 3. Can a genetic factormodify the co-learning effect on memory? More specifically, can co-learningcorrect memory deficits in autistic-like BTBR inbred mice with deficientsociability? We demonstrated that pairs of familiar inbred mice of the same ordifferent genotypes (C57BL/6J and BTBR) that were habituated to new objects andtheir spatial location, had enhanced episodic memory in the spatial objectrecognition test, whereas individually-trained animals failed to solve this task.Notably, the co-learning effect was genotype-dependent. BTBR mice paired withBTBR cage-mates in the habituation session modestly ameliorated their performancein the object recognition test but co-learning with a familiar C57BL/6J mousecompletely normalized episodic memory deficit. Next, we explored the co-learning effect on fear memory in these inbred strains. Interestingly, mice of bothgenotypes displayed significantly enhanced contextual fear memory once they hadbeen conditioned together with BTBR animals. The same influence of BTBR presence was observed on cued fear memory in C57BL/6J mice, whereas a modest co-learningeffect was found on cued fear conditioning in the BTBR strain. Taken together, wedemonstrated for the first time the co-learning effect on cognitive capacities inmice, which can be modified by genetic background and environmental conditions.The possible implications of this methodological approach in social neuroscience are discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'CognitiveEnhancers'.
 BACKGROUND: Research on cooperative behavior and the social brain exists, butlittle research has focused on real-time motor cooperative behavior and itsneural correlates. In this proof of concept study, we explored the conceptualnotion of shared and complementary mental models through EEG mapping of twobrains performing a real-world interactive motor task of increasing difficulty.We used the recently introduced participative "juggling paradigm," and collected neuro-physiological and psycho-social data. We were interested in analyzing thebetween-brains coupling during a dyadic juggling task, and in exploring therelationship between the motor task execution, the jugglers'skill level and thetask difficulty. We also investigated how this relationship could be mirrored in the coupled functional organization of the interacting brains. METHODS: Tocapture the neural schemas underlying the notion of shared and complementarymental models, we examined the functional connectivity patterns and hyperbrainfeatures of a juggling dyad involved in cooperative motor tasks of increasingdifficulty. Jugglers' cortical activity was measured using two synchronized32-channel EEG systems during dyadic juggling performed with 3, 4, 5 and 6 balls.Individual and hyperbrain functional connections were quantified throughcoherence maps calculated across all electrode pairs in the theta and alpha bands(4-8 and 8-12 Hz). Graph metrics were used to typify the global topology andefficiency of the functional networks for the four difficulty levels in the thetaand alpha bands. RESULTS: Results indicated that, as task difficulty increased,the cortical functional organization of the more skilled juggler becameprogressively more segregated in both frequency bands, with a small-worldorganization in the theta band during easier tasks, indicative of a flow-likestate in line with the neural efficiency hypothesis. Conversely, more integrated functional patterns were observed for the less skilled juggler in both frequency bands, possibly related to cognitive overload due to the difficulty of the taskat hand (reinvestment hypothesis). At the hyperbrain level, a segregatedfunctional organization involving areas of the visuo-attentional networks of bothjugglers was observed in both frequency bands and for the easier task only.DISCUSSION: These results suggest that cooperative juggling is supported byintegrated activity of specialized cortical areas from both brains only duringeasier tasks, whereas it relies on individual skills, mirrored in uncorrelatedindividual brain activations, during more difficult tasks. These findings suggestthat task difficulty and jugglers' personal skills may influence the features of the hyperbrain network in its shared/integrative and complementary/segregativetendencies.
 Loneliness typically refers to the feelings of distress and dysphoria resultingfrom a discrepancy between a person's desired and achieved levels of socialrelations, and there is now considerable evidence that loneliness is a riskfactor for poor psychological and physical health. Loneliness has traditionallybeen conceptualized as a uniquely human phenomenon. However, over millions ofyears of evolution, efficient and manifold neural, hormonal, and molecularmechanisms have evolved for promoting companionship and mutualprotection/assistance and for organizing adaptive responses when there is asignificant discrepancy between the preferred and realized levels of socialconnection. We review evidence suggesting that loneliness is not a uniquely humanphenomenon, but, instead, as a scientific construct, it represents a generallyadaptive predisposition that can be found across phylogeny. Central to thisargument is the premise that the brain is the key organ of social connections andprocesses. Comparative studies and animal models, particularly when integratedwith human studies, have much to contribute to the understanding of lonelinessand its underlying principles, mechanisms, consequences, and potentialtreatments.
 The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system plays a key role in a diversityof behaviors accompanying stress, anxiety and depression. There is alsosubstantial research on relationships between social behaviors and the CRF systemin a variety of taxa including fish, birds, rodents, and primates. Some of these relationships are due to the broad role of CRF and urocortins in stress andanxiety, but these peptides also modulate social behavior specifically. Forexample, the social interaction (SI) test is often used to measure anxiety-likebehavior. Many components of the CRF system including CRF, urocortin1, and the R1receptor have been implicated in SI, via general effects on anxiety as well asspecific effects depending on the brain region. The CRF system is also highlyresponsive to chronic social stressors such as social defeat and isolation.Animals exposed to these stressors display a number of anxiety- andstress-related behaviors, accompanied by changes in specific components the CRFsystem. Although the primary focus of CRF research on social behavior has been onthe deleterious effects of social stress, there are also insights on a role forCRF and urocortins in prosocial and affiliative behaviors. The CRF system hasbeen implicated in parental care, maternal defense, sexual behavior, and pairbonding. Species differences in the ligands and CRF receptors have been observed in vole and bird species differing in social behavior. Exogenous administrationof CRF facilitates partner preference formation in monogamous male prairie voles,and these effects are dependent on both the CRF R1 and R2 receptors. Thesefindings are particularly interesting as studies have also implicated the CRF andurocortins in social memory. With the rapid progress of social neuroscience andin understanding the complex structure of the CRF system, the next challenge isin parsing the exact contribution of individual components of this system tospecific social behaviors.
 Since Darwin's seminal works, the universality of facial expressions of emotionhas remained one of the longest standing debates in the biological and socialsciences. Briefly stated, the universality hypothesis claims that all humanscommunicate six basic internal emotional states (happy, surprise, fear, disgust, anger, and sad) using the same facial movements by virtue of their biological andevolutionary origins [Susskind JM, et al. (2008) Nat Neurosci 11:843-850]. Here, we refute this assumed universality. Using a unique computer graphics platformthat combines generative grammars [Chomsky N (1965) MIT Press, Cambridge, MA]with visual perception, we accessed the mind's eye of 30 Western and Easternculture individuals and reconstructed their mental representations of the sixbasic facial expressions of emotion. Cross-cultural comparisons of the mentalrepresentations challenge universality on two separate counts. First, whereasWesterners represent each of the six basic emotions with a distinct set of facialmovements common to the group, Easterners do not. Second, Easterners representemotional intensity with distinctive dynamic eye activity. By refuting thelong-standing universality hypothesis, our data highlight the powerful influence of culture on shaping basic behaviors once considered biologically hardwired.Consequently, our data open a unique nature-nurture debate across broad fieldsfrom evolutionary psychology and social neuroscience to social networking viadigital avatars.
 This study investigated individual differences in the integration of social(i.e., direction of social interest) and physical (i.e., apparent health) cues ina face preference test. While low-anxiety individuals demonstrated preferencesfor social engagement from healthy-looking faces, but not from unhealthy-looking faces, high-anxiety individuals preferred social engagement from both healthy andunhealthy individuals. Importantly, anxious individuals were not simply lessdiscriminating in their face preferences generally: anxiety levels werepositively related to the strength of overall preferences for positive socialinterest. Collectively, our findings show that perceptions of gaze and expressioncan be modulated by aspects of facial appearance and that systematic variationamong individuals exists in the extent to which this modulation occurs.Furthermore, since previous studies have demonstrated hypersensitive amygdalaresponses among anxious individuals when viewing faces, our findings suggest thatthe amygdala may play an important role in determining how different facial cues are integrated in person perception.
 Patients with Parkinson's disease suffer from significant motor impairments andaccompanying cognitive and affective dysfunction due to progressive disturbances of basal ganglia-cortical gating loops. Parkinson's disease has a longpresymptomatic stage, which indicates a substantial capacity of the human brainto compensate for dopaminergic nerve degeneration before clinical manifestationof the disease. Neuroimaging studies provide evidence that increasedmotor-related cortical activity can compensate for progressive dopaminergic nervedegeneration in carriers of a single mutant Parkin or PINK1 gene, who show a mildbut significant reduction of dopamine metabolism in the basal ganglia in thecomplete absence of clinical motor signs. However, it is currently unknownwhether similar compensatory mechanisms are effective in non-motor basalganglia-cortical gating loops. Here, we ask whether asymptomatic Parkin mutation carriers show altered patterns of brain activity during processing of facialgestures, and whether this might compensate for latent facial emotion recognitiondeficits. Current theories in social neuroscience assume that execution andperception of facial gestures are linked by a special class of visuomotor neurons('mirror neurons') in the ventrolateral premotor cortex/pars opercularis of theinferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 44/6). We hypothesized that asymptomaticParkin mutation carriers would show increased activity in this area duringprocessing of affective facial gestures, replicating the compensatory motoreffects that have previously been observed in these individuals. Additionally,Parkin mutation carriers might show altered activity in other basalganglia-cortical gating loops. Eight asymptomatic heterozygous Parkin mutationcarriers and eight matched controls underwent functional magnetic resonanceimaging and a subsequent facial emotion recognition task. As predicted, Parkinmutation carriers showed significantly stronger activity in the rightventrolateral premotor cortex during execution and perception of affective facialgestures than healthy controls. Furthermore, Parkin mutation carriers showed aslightly reduced ability to recognize facial emotions that was least severe inindividuals who showed the strongest increase of ventrolateral premotor activity.In addition, Parkin mutation carriers showed a significantly weaker than normalincrease of activity in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (inferior frontalgyrus pars orbitalis, Brodmann area 47), which was unrelated to facial emotionrecognition ability. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis thatcompensatory activity in the ventrolateral premotor cortex during processing ofaffective facial gestures can reduce impairments in facial emotion recognition insubclinical Parkin mutation carriers. A breakdown of this compensatory mechanism might lead to the impairment of facial expressivity and facial emotionrecognition observed in manifest Parkinson's disease.
 Social decision-making is often complex, requiring the decision-maker to makeinferences of others' mental states in addition to engaging traditionaldecision-making processes like valuation and reward processing. A growing body ofresearch in neuroeconomics has examined decision-making involving social andnon-social stimuli to explore activity in brain regions such as the striatum and prefrontal cortex, largely ignoring the power of the social context. Perhaps morecomplex processes may influence decision-making in social vs. non-socialcontexts. Years of social psychology and social neuroscience research havedocumented a multitude of processes (e.g., mental state inferences, impressionformation, spontaneous trait inferences) that occur upon viewing another person. These processes rely on a network of brain regions including medial prefrontalcortex (MPFC), superior temporal sulcus (STS), temporal parietal junction, andprecuneus among others. Undoubtedly, these social cognition processes affectsocial decision-making since mental state inferences occur spontaneously andautomatically. Few studies have looked at how these social inference processesaffect decision-making in a social context despite the capability of theseinferences to serve as predictions that can guide future decision-making. Here wereview and integrate the person perception and decision-making literatures tounderstand how social cognition can inform the study of social decision-making ina way that is consistent with both literatures. We identify gaps in bothliteratures-while behavioral economics largely ignores social processes thatspontaneously occur upon viewing another person, social psychology has largelyfailed to talk about the implications of social cognition processes in aneconomic decision-making context-and examine the benefits of integrating socialpsychological theory with behavioral economic theory.
 Self-other differentiation requires both that one can understand the actionsothers perform, and that one can attribute these actions to them. Understandingimplies that a complete description of the actions of other agents can beavailable in the brain of the observer. Attributing implies that the agent can beclearly differentiated from the self. The model for the self-otherdifferentiation proposed here can therefore involve two steps: I first displacemyself at the location of the person I observe in order to specify her/hislocation in space. Then, I simulate the action I observe from that person inorder to understand what she/he is doing. Assuming that the two operations aremore or less synchronous, the action I simulate is automatically attributed tothe person I observe, not to myself. The simulation network in the observer'sbrain overlaps with the execution network in the agent's brain; by contrast, the rotation network is specific to the observer's brain. In a neuroimagingexperiment using PET, we compared brain activity during a task where the subjectssimulated an action of grasping an object from either first-person orthird-person perspectives. This comparison revealed an activation limited to the parieto-occipital junction (area 19), which appeared to be specific to thethird-person perspective. The activation of this area is proposed to represent a cue for the self-other differentiation.
 While the neurobiology of post-traumatic stress disorder has been extensivelyresearched, much less attention has been paid to the neural mechanisms underlyingmore covert but pervasive types of trauma (e.g., those involving disruptedrelationships and insecure attachment). Here, we report on a neurobiologicalstudy documenting that mothers' attachment-related trauma, when unresolved,undermines her optimal brain response to her infant's distress. We examined theamygdala blood oxygenation level-dependent response in 42 first-time mothers asthey underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning, viewing happy- andsad-face images of their own infant, along with those of a matched unknowninfant. Whereas mothers with no trauma demonstrated greater amygdala responses tothe sad faces of their own infant as compared to their happy faces, mothers whowere classified as having unresolved trauma in the Adult Attachment Interview(Dynamic Maturational Model) displayed blunted amygdala responses when cued bytheir own infants' sadness as compared to happiness. Unknown infant faces did notelicit differential amygdala responses between the mother groups. The blunting ofthe amygdala response in traumatized mothers is discussed as a neural indication of mothers' possible disengagement from infant distress, which may be part of aprocess linking maternal unresolved trauma and disrupted maternal caregiving.
 Developments within the neurosciences, cognitive sciences, and social scienceshave contributed to the emergence of social neuroscience. Among the most obvious contemporary developments are brain-imaging procedures such as functionalmagnetic resonance imaging. The authors outline a set of first principlesdesigned to help make sense of brain-imaging research within the fields ofcognitive and social neuroscience. They begin with a principle few woulddebate--that social cognition, emotion, and behavior involve the brain--but whoseimplications might not be entirely obvious to those new to the field. The authorsconclude that (a). complex aspects of the mind and behavior will benefit from yeta broader collaboration of neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, and socialscientists, and (b). social psychologists bring important theoretical,methodological, and statistical expertise to this interdisciplinary enterprise.
 In the field of social neuroscience, major branches of research have beeninstrumental in describing independent components of typical and aberrant social information processing, but the field as a whole lacks a comprehensive model thatintegrates different branches. We review existing research related to the neural basis of three key neural systems underlying social information processing:social perception, action observation, and theory of mind. We propose anintegrative model that unites these three processes and highlights the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), which plays a central role in all three systems.Furthermore, we integrate these neural systems with the dual system account ofimplicit and explicit social information processing. Large-scale meta-analysesbased on Neurosynth confirmed that the pSTS is at the intersection of the threeneural systems. Resting-state functional connectivity analysis with 1000 subjectsconfirmed that the pSTS is connected to all other regions in these systems. Thefindings presented in this review are specifically relevant for psychiatricresearch especially disorders characterized by social deficits such as autismspectrum disorder.
 A new study suggests that individuals differentially recruit neural regionsassociated with decision making, depending on whether the information about theoptions are learned through experience or merely described.
 RATIONALE: Love has long been referred to as an addiction in literature andpoetry. Scientists have often made comparisons between social attachmentprocesses and drug addiction, and it has been suggested that the two may share a common neurobiological mechanism. Brain systems that evolved to governattachments between parents and children and between monogamous partners may bethe targets of drugs of abuse and serve as the basis for addiction processes.OBJECTIVES: Here, we review research on drug addiction in parallel with research on social attachments, including parent-offspring attachments and social bondsbetween mating partners. This review focuses on the brain regions andneurochemicals with the greatest overlap between addiction and attachment and, inparticular, the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) pathway. RESULTS: Significant overlapexists between these two behavioral processes. In addition to conceptual overlap in symptomatology, there is a strong commonality between the two domainsregarding the roles and sites of action of DA, opioids, andcorticotropin-releasing factor. The neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin arehypothesized to integrate social information into attachment processes that isnot present in drug addiction. CONCLUSIONS: Social attachment may be understoodas a behavioral addiction, whereby the subject becomes addicted to anotherindividual and the cues that predict social reward. Understandings from bothfields may enlighten future research on addiction and attachment processes.
 Oxytocin receptors (OTR) have been characterized in the brains of severalmammals, including rodents, carnivores, and primates. Their species-specificdistribution in the brain has been associated with species differences in social organization, including mating strategy and parenting behavior. In severalspecies, the density of OTR binding in specific brain regions varies according toreproductive condition, including ovarian cycle, pregnancy and lactation. Rabbitsare induced ovulators, polygamous, and monoparental but their distribution andregulation of brain OTR has not been described. Here we used receptorautoradiography to quantitatively characterize OTR binding in the brains ofestrous, ovariectomized, late pregnant, and lactating does. Intense bindingoccurred in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), preoptic area (POA), lateral septum (LS;dorsal and ventral), hippocampus, and medial amygdala. Variations among theexperimental groups were seen only in PFC, POA, LS. Ovariectomy increased OTRdensity in PFC but had the opposite effect in POA. Lactating does hadsignificantly reduced OTR density, relative to late pregnancy, in PFC and POA.Our results are consistent with a possible role of OT in modulating social andmaternal behavior in rabbits since the brain regions sensitive to OT have beenimplicated in social interaction, learning and memory, olfactory processing andmaternal behavior.
 One of the difficulties facing schizophrenia patients is a failure to constructappropriate relationships with others in social situations. This impairment ofsocial cognition is also found in autism-spectrum disorder (ASD). Consideringsuch commonality between the two disorders, in this study we adopted theAutism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) score to assess autistic traits, and explored theassociation between such traits and gray matter (GM) alterations of the brain in schizophrenia. Twenty schizophrenia patients and 25 healthy controls underwentstructural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and AQ was assessed, comprising fivesubscales measuring different facets of autistic traits. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was applied to investigate the correlation between these AQ scores andregional GM alterations. Schizophrenia patients showed significantly higherscores in total AQ, and in four of the five subscales, compared to healthycontrols. The total AQ score in schizophrenia showed significant negativecorrelation with GM volume reduction in the cortical area surrounding the leftsuperior temporal sulcus (STS), which is considered to be important in socialperception. Our findings suggest a possible neuroanatomical basis of autistictendencies in schizophrenia.
 Motion smoothness is critical in transmitting implicit information of bodyaction, such as aesthetic qualities in dance performances. We expected that theperception of motion smoothness would be characterized by great intersubjectvariability deriving from differences in personal backgrounds and attitudestoward expressive body actions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging anda humanoid robot to investigate the effects of the motion smoothness ofexpressive body actions and the intersubject variability due to personalattitudes on perceptions during dance observation. The effect of motionsmoothness was analyzed by both conventional subtraction analysis and functional connectivity analyses that detect cortical networks reflecting intersubjectvariability. The results showed that the cortical networks of motion- andbody-sensitive visual areas showed increases in activity in areas correspondingwith motion smoothness, but the intersubject variability of personal attitudestoward art did not influence these active areas. In contrast, activation ofcortical networks, including the parieto-frontal network, has large intersubject variability, and this variability is associated with personal attitudes about theconsciousness of art. Thus, our results suggest that activity in the corticalnetwork involved in understanding action is influenced by personal attitudesabout the consciousness of art during observations of expressive body actions.
 The dorsomedial frontal part of the cerebral cortex is consistently activatedwhen people read the mental states of others, such as their beliefs, desires, andintentions, the ability known as having a theory of mind (ToM) or mentalizing.This ubiquitous finding has led many researchers to conclude that the dorsomedialfrontal cortex (DMFC) constitutes a core component in mentalizing networks.Despite this, it remains unclear why the DMFC becomes active during ToM tasks. Weargue that key psychological and behavioral aspects in mentalizing are closelyassociated with DMFC functions. These include executive inhibition, distinctionbetween self and others, prediction under uncertainty, and perception ofintentions, all of which are important for predicting others' intention andbehavior. We review the literature supporting this claim, ranging in fields from developmental psychology to human neuroimaging and macaque electrophysiology.Because perceiving intentions in others' actions initiates mentalizing and forms the basis of virtually all types of social interaction, the fundamental issue in social neuroscience is to determine the aspects of physical entities that make anobserver perceive that they are intentional beings and to clarify theneurobiological underpinnings of the perception of intentionality in others'actions.
 Adult appropriate responding to salient infant signals is vital to child healthy psychological development. Here we investigated how infant crying, relative toother emotive sounds of infant laughing or adult crying, captures adults' brainresources. In a sample of nulliparous women and men, we investigated the effects of different sounds on cerebral activation of the default mode network (DMN) and reaction times (RTs) while listeners engaged in self-referential decision andsyllabic counting tasks, which, respectively, require the activation ordeactivation of the DMN. Sounds affect women and men differently. In women,infant crying deactivated the DMN during the self-referential decision task; inmen, female adult crying interfered with the DMN during the syllabic countingtask. These findings point to different brain processes underlying responsivenessto crying in women and men and show that cerebral activation is modulated bysituational contexts in which crying occurs.
 Modern advancements in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technologyhave given neuroscientists the opportunity to more fully appreciate the brain'scontribution to human behavior and decision making. Morality and moral reasoning are relative newcomers to the growing literature on decision neuroscience. Withrecent attention given to the salience of moral factors (e.g. moral emotions,moral reasoning) in the process of decision making, neuroscientists have begun tooffer helpful frameworks for understanding the interplay between the brain,morality, and human decision making. These frameworks are relatively unfamiliarto the community of forensic psychologists, despite the fact that they offer animproved understanding of judicial decision making from a biological perspective.This article presents a framework reviewing how event-feature-emotion complexes(EFEC) are relevant to jurors and understanding complex criminal behavior. Futuredirections regarding converging fields of neuroscience and legal decision making are considered.
 Eye contact is a highly salient and fundamentally social signal. This entailsthat the mere perception of direct gaze may trigger differentiatedneurobehavioral responses as compared to other gaze directions. We investigatedthis issue using a visual word-spelling task where faces under different gazedirections and head orientations were displayed on-screen concomitantly with the words. We show evidence for automatic increase of skin conductance response(SCR), indicative of arousal, associated with the perception of direct gaze ascompared to both averted gaze and closed eyes. Moreover, the perception ofaverted gaze was associated with an increase of electromyographic (EMG)corrugator activity. These effects were observed in two demanding word-spellingtasks, but not in a simple letter decision task. We propose to interpret thesefindings in terms of the social value of direct and averted gaze and concludethat some circumstances such as the task at hand may be essential for uncovering the neurobehavioral responses associated with the perception of others' gaze.
 Decision-making in social dilemmas is suggested to rely on three factors: thevaluation of a choice option, the relative judgment of two or more choicealternatives, and individual factors affecting the ease at which judgments anddecisions are made. Here, we test whether empathy-an individual's relativeability to understand others' thoughts, emotions, and intentions-acts as anindividual factor that alleviates conflict resolution in social decision-making. We test this by using a framed, iterated prisoners' dilemma (PD) game in twosettings. In a behavioral experiment, we find that individual differences inempathic ability (the Empathy Quotient, EQ) were related to lower response times in the PD game, suggesting that empathy is related to faster social choices,independent of whether they choose to cooperate or defect. In a subsequentneuroimaging experiment, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we findthat EQ is positively related to individual differences in the engagement ofbrain structures implemented in mentalizing, including the precuneus, superiortemporal sulcus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These results suggest thatempathy is related to the individual difference in the engagement of mentalizing in social dilemmas and that this is related to the efficiency of decision-making in social dilemmas.
 Previous research demonstrated that young infants' neural processing of novelobjects is enhanced by a fearful face gazing toward the object. The currentevent-related potential (ERP) study addresses the question of whether this effectis driven by the particular threat-value of a fearful expression or whether apositive emotion could elicit a similar response. Three-month-old infants' brain responses were measured while infants were presented with happy and neutral facesgazing toward simultaneously presented objects (Experiment 1) or happy andneutral faces gazing away from objects (Experiment 2). Then the objects werepresented again without the face. While infants showed an increased neuralresponse for happy relative to neutral faces looking towards objects, infants didnot differentiate between happy and neutral faces gazing away from the objects.Furthermore, infants showed no different response to objects alone in Experiment 1. However, infants responded with an increased negative central component (Nc)indicating increased attention for objects in the neutral face condition inExperiment 2. The current results confirm previous findings showing that infants allocate increased attention to an emotional face if it directs eye gaze towardan object in the environment. However, a happy expression does not increasesubsequent processing of the gaze-cued object. The findings are discussed interms of early social cognitive development.
 Naturalistic studies of gene-environment interactions (G X E) have been plaguedby several limitations, including difficulty isolating specific environmentalrisk factors from other correlated aspects of the environment, gene-environmentcorrelation (rGE ), and the use of a single genetic variant to represent theinfluence of a gene. We present results from 235 Finnish young men in two labstudies of aggression and alcohol challenge that attempt to redress theselimitations of the extant G X E literature. Specifically, we use a latentvariable modeling approach in an attempt to more fully account for geneticvariation across the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) and to robustly test its main effects on aggression and its interaction with alcohol exposure. We also modeled aggression as a latent variable comprising various indices, including the averageand maximum levels of aggression, the earliest trial on which aggression wasexpressed, and the proportion of trials on which the minimum and maximum levelsof aggression were expressed. The best fitting model for the genetic variationacross OXTR included six factors derived from an exploratory factor analysis,roughly corresponding to six haplotype blocks. Aggression levels were higher ontrials in which participants were administered alcohol, won, or were provoked.There was a significant main effect of OXTR on aggression across studies aftercontrolling for covariates. The interaction of OXTR and alcohol was alsosignificant across studies, such that OXTR had stronger effects on aggression in the alcohol administration condition. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
 Recently, cortisol has been suggested to moderate the positive relationshipbetween testosterone and antisocial behavior. More precisely, high testosteronelevels have been found to be related to aggressive or dominant behaviorespecially when cortisol levels were low. In the present study, we aimed toextend these findings to pro-environmental behavior as an indicator of prosocial behavior. In a first step, 147 male participants provided information on theireveryday pro-environmental behavior by completing an online questionnaire onvarious energy-saving behaviors. In a second step, subjects provided two salivasamples for the assessment of testosterone and cortisol on two subsequentmornings after awakening. We found that testosterone was negatively related topro-environmental behavior, but only in men with low cortisol. In conclusion, ourfindings provide first evidence for the joint association of testosterone andcortisol with everyday pro-environmental behavior. These results furtherreinforce the importance of considering interdependent hormone systemssimultaneously rather than focusing on a single hormone.
 Human decision-making is significantly modulated by previously experiencedoutcomes. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we examined whether ERPcomponents evoked by outcome feedbacks could serve as biomarkers to signal theinfluence of current outcome evaluation on subsequent decision-making. In thisstudy, 18 adult volunteers participated in a simple monetary gambling task, inwhich they were asked to choose between two options that differed in risk. Their decisions were immediately followed by outcome presentation. Temporospatialprinciple component analysis (PCA) was applied to the outcome-onset locked ERPsin the 200-1000 ms time window. The PCA factors that approximated classical ERPcomponents (P2, feedback-related negativity, P3a, and P3b) in terms of timecourse and scalp distribution were tested for their association with subsequentdecision-making strategies. Our results revealed that a fronto-central PCA factorapproximating the classical P3a was related to changes of decision-makingstrategies on subsequent trials. The decision to switch between high- andlow-risk options resulted in a larger P3a relative to the decision to retain the same choice. According to the results, we suggest that the amplitude of thefronto-central P3a is an electrophysiological index of the influence of currentoutcome on subsequent risk decision-making. Furthermore, the ERP source analysis indicated that the activations of the frontopolar cortex and sensorimotor cortex were involved in subsequent changes of strategies, which enriches ourunderstanding of the neural mechanisms of adjusting decision-making strategiesbased on previous experience.
 Aggressive behavior is aimed at causing damage or pain to another individual.Aggression has been associated with structural and functional deficits innumerous brain areas, including the dorsolateral region of the prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), typically related to inhibition and impulse control. In this study, weused inhibitory continuous theta-burst magnetic stimulation (cTBS) to explore therole of the right and left DLPFC in aggression. Sixteen healthy right-handedvolunteers underwent two sessions involving random, real and sham, right and leftDLPFC stimulations. These sessions were followed by the Social OrientationParadigm (SOP), a monetary task that was specially designed to assessparticipants' aggressive tendencies by measuring the patterns of their reactiveaggression (a response to a perceived provocation) and proactive aggression (anaggressive act with goal-oriented purposes). Results indicate that using cTBS to target the left DLPFC was associated with a greater increase in aggressiveresponses than right DLPFC stimulation. This pattern of results was found forboth reactive and proactive types of aggressive reactions. It is concluded thatDLPFC asymmetry is involved in modulating reactive and proactive aggression. Our results are in line with recent studies suggesting that the left DLPFC plays amajor role in aggressive behavior.
 Marital discord is costly to children, families, and communities. The advent ofthe Internet, social networking, and on-line dating has affected how people meet future spouses, but little is known about the prevalence or outcomes of thesemarriages or the demographics of those involved. We addressed these questions in a nationally representative sample of 19,131 respondents who married between 2005and 2012. Results indicate that more than one-third of marriages in America nowbegin on-line. In addition, marriages that began on-line, when compared withthose that began through traditional off-line venues, were slightly less likelyto result in a marital break-up (separation or divorce) and were associated with slightly higher marital satisfaction among those respondents who remainedmarried. Demographic differences were identified between respondents who mettheir spouse through on-line vs. traditional off-line venues, but the findingsfor marital break-up and marital satisfaction remained significant afterstatistically controlling for these differences. These data suggest that theInternet may be altering the dynamics and outcomes of marriage itself.
 Here we examine whether brain responses to dynamic facial expressions of pain areinfluenced by our responsibility for the observed pain. Participants played aflanker task with a confederate. Whenever either erred, the confederate was seen to receive a noxious shock. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we foundthat regions of the functionally localized pain-matrix of the participants (theanterior insula in particular) were activated most strongly when seeing theconfederate receive a noxious shock when only the participant had erred (andhence had full responsibility). When both or only the confederate had erred (i.e.participant's shared or no responsibility), significantly weaker vicariouspain-matrix activations were measured.
 Depression is associated with alterations in corticostriatal reward circuitry.One pathophysiological pathway that may drive these changes is inflammation.Biomarkers of inflammation (for example, cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP)) are reliably elevated in depressed patients. Moreover, administration ofinflammatory stimuli reduces neural activity and dopamine release inreward-related brain regions in association with reduced motivation andanhedonia. Accordingly, we examined whether increased inflammation in depression affects corticostriatal reward circuitry to lead to deficits in motivation andgoal-directed motor behavior. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imagingwas conducted on 48 medically stable, unmedicated outpatients with majordepression. Whole-brain, voxel-wise functional connectivity was examined as afunction of CRP using seeds for subdivisions of the ventral and dorsal striatumassociated with motivation and motor control. Increased CRP was associated withdecreased connectivity between ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontalcortex (vmPFC) (corrected P<0.05), which in turn correlated with increasedanhedonia (R=-0.47, P=0.001). Increased CRP similarly predicted decreased dorsal striatal to vmPFC and presupplementary motor area connectivity, which correlated with decreased motor speed (R=0.31 to 0.45, P<0.05) and increased psychomotorslowing (R=-0.35, P=0.015). Of note, mediation analyses revealed that theseeffects of CRP on connectivity mediated significant relationships between CRP andanhedonia and motor slowing. Finally, connectivity between striatum and vmPFC wasassociated with increased plasma interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta and IL-1 receptorantagonist (R=-0.33 to -0.36, P<0.05). These findings suggest that decreasedcorticostriatal connectivity may serve as a target for anti-inflammatory orpro-dopaminergic treatment strategies to improve motivational and motor deficits in patients with increased inflammation, including depression.
 Two competing hypotheses address neuroplasticity during early brain development: the "Kennard principle" describes the compensatory capacities of the immaturedeveloping CNS as superior to those of the adult brain, whereas the "Hebbprinciple" argues that the young brain is especially sensitive to insults. Weprovide evidence that these principles are not mutually exclusive. Followingearly brain lesions that are unilateral, the brain can refer to homotopic areasof the healthy hemisphere. This potential for reorganization is unique to theyoung brain but available only when, during ontogenesis of brain development,these areas have been used for the functions addressed. With respect to motorfunction, ipsilateral motor tracts can be recruited, which are only availableduring early brain development. Language can be reorganized to the right afterearly left hemispheric lesions, as the representation of the language network is initially bilateral. However, even in these situations, compensatory capacitiesof the developing brain are found to have limitations, probably defined by early determinants. Thus, plasticity and adaptivity are seen only within ontogeneticpotential; that is, axonal or cortical structures cannot be recruited beyondearly developmental possibilities. The young brain is probably more sensitive andvulnerable to lesions when these are bilateral. This is shown here for bilateral periventricular white matter lesions that clearly have an impact on corticalarchitecture and function, thus probably interfering with early network building.
 BACKGROUND: Until now there has been no way of distinguishing betweenphysiological and epileptic hippocampal ripples in intracranial recordings. Inthe present study we addressed this by investigating the effect of cognitivestimulation on interictal high frequency oscillations in the ripple range (80-250Hz) within epileptic (EH) and non-epileptic hippocampus (NH). METHODS: Weanalyzed depth EEG recordings in 10 patients with intractable epilepsy, in whomhippocampal activity was recorded initially during quiet wakefulness andsubsequently during a simple cognitive task. Using automated detection of ripplesbased on amplitude of the power envelope, we analyzed ripple rate (RR) in thecognitive and resting period, within EH and NH. RESULTS: Compared to quietwakefulness we observed a significant reduction of RR during cognitivestimulation in EH, while it remained statistically marginal in NH. Further, weinvestigated the direct impact of cognitive stimuli on ripples (i.e. immediately post-stimulus), which showed a transient statistically significant suppression ofripples in the first second after stimuli onset in NH only. CONCLUSION: Ourresults point to a differential reactivity of ripples within EH and NH tocognitive stimulation.
 Many studies involving functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have exposed participants to paintings under varying task demands. To isolate neural systemsthat are activated reliably across fMRI studies in response to viewing paintings regardless of variation in task demands, a quantitative meta-analysis of fifteen experiments using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method wasconducted. As predicted, viewing paintings was correlated with activation in adistributed system including the occipital lobes, temporal lobe structures in theventral stream involved in object (fusiform gyrus) and scene (parahippocampalgyrus) perception, and the anterior insula-a key structure in experience ofemotion. In addition, we also observed activation in the posterior cingulatecortex bilaterally-part of the brain's default network. These results suggestthat viewing paintings engages not only systems involved in visual representationand object recognition, but also structures underlying emotions and internalized cognitions.
 Disorganized attachment is an early predictor of the development ofpsychopathology in childhood and adolescence. Lyons-Ruth et al. (1999) developed the AMBIANCE coding scheme to assess disrupted communication between mother andinfant, and reported the link between maternal behavior and disorganizedattachment. The Hungarian group found an association between a polymorphism ofthe DRD4 gene and disorganized attachment (Lakatos et al., 2000; 2002; Gervai et al., 2005). The present collaborative work investigated the interplay betweengenetic and caregiving contributions to disorganized attachment. 138mother-infant dyads, 96 from a Hungarian low-social-risk sample and 42 from a US high-social-risk sample, were assessed for infant disorganized attachmentbehavior, for DRD4 gene polymorphisms, and for disrupted forms of maternalaffective communication with the infant. In accord with literature reports, wefound a robust main effect of maternal AMBIANCE scores on infant disorganization.However, this relation held only for the majority of infants who carried theshort form of the DRD4 allele. Among carriers of the 7-repeat DRD4 allele, there was no relation between quality of maternal communication and infantdisorganization. This interaction effect was independent of degree of social riskand maternal DRD4 genotype.
 This study measured event-related potentials during spontaneous and intentionalgoal inferences. Participants read sentences describing the behavior of a target person from which a strong goal or intention could be inferred. The last word of each sentence determined the consistency with the goal induced during precedingsentences. In comparison with behaviors that were consistent with the impliedgoal, a stronger P200 waveform was obtained when the behaviors were irrelevantwith that goal or did not contain goal-directed behavior at all, and this P200showed considerable parallels between spontaneous and intentional inferences.This indicates that goals were inferred rapidly and automatically while readingthe behaviors, irrespective of the participants' spontaneous or intentionalinstructions. In line with this, source localization (LORETA) of theevent-related potentials shows predominantly activation in the temporoparietaljunction (TPJ) during and immediately after goal detection (225-300 ms). Beforeand after this time interval, however, activation is stronger at the TPJ duringspontaneous processing, and stronger at the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)during intentional processing. Memory measures taken after the presentation ofthe stimulus materials support the occurrence of goal inferences and showsignificant correlations with the neural components, indicating that thesecomponents are valid neural indices of spontaneous and intentional goalinferences. The results are highly similar to previous ERP research on traitinferences that revealed a similar division of brain activation for spontaneous(TPJ) and intentional (mPFC) processes, but appearing later at about 600 ms,pointing to similar brain areas recruited for social inferences, but at differenttimings for different inference types.
 Even though electroencephalography has played a prominent role for lie detection via personally relevant information, the electrophysiological signature of activelying is still elusive. We addressed this signature with two experiments in whichparticipants helped a virtual police officer to locate a knife. Crucially, beforethis response, they announced whether they would lie or tell the truth about the knife's location. This design allowed us to study the signature of lie-telling inthe absence of rare and personally significant oddball stimuli that are typicallyused for lie detection via electrophysiological markers, especially the P300component. Our results indicate that active lying attenuated P300 amplitudes aswell as N200 amplitudes for such non-oddball stimuli. These results supportaccounts that stress the high cognitive demand of lie-telling, including the needto suppress the truthful response and to generate a lie.
 The ability to integrate the moral intention information with the outcome of anaction plays a crucial role in mature moral judgment. Functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) studies implicated that both prefrontal andtemporo-parietal cortices are involved in moral intention and outcome processing.Here, we used the event-related potentials (ERPs) technique to investigate thetemporal dynamics of the processing of the integration between intention andoutcome information in harmful and helpful moral judgment. In two experiments,participants were asked to make moral judgments for agents who produced eithernegative/neutral outcomes with harmful/neutral intentions (harmful judgment) orpositive/neutral outcomes with helpful/neutral intentions (helpful judgment).Significant ERP differences between attempted and successful actions overprefrontal and bilateral temporo-parietal regions were found in both harmful and helpful moral judgment, which suggest a possible time course of the integrationprocessing in the brain, starting from the right temporo-parietal area (N180) to the left temporo-parietal area (N250), then the prefrontal area (FSW) and theright temporo-parietal area (TP450 and TPSW) again. These results highlighted thefast moral intuition reaction and the late integration processing over the right temporo-parietal area.
 Persuasion, a prevalent form of social influence in humans, refers to an activeattempt to change a person's attitudes, beliefs, or behavior. There is a growing literature on the neural correlates of persuasion. As is often the case in anemerging literature, however, there are a number of questions, concerns, andalternative interpretations that can be raised about the research andinterpretations. We provide a critical review of the research, noting potentialproblems and issues that warrant attention to move the field forward. Among therecommendations are greater integration of neuroimaging approaches with existing behavioral theories and methods on the information processes (cognitive andaffective) underlying persuasion, and moving beyond solely correlative approachesfor specifying underlying neural mechanisms. Work in this area has the potential to contribute to our understanding of brain-behavior relationships as well as to advance our understanding of persuasion and social influence more generally.
 The anterior insula (AI) and mid-anterior cingulate cortex (mACC) have repeatedlybeen implicated in first-hand and vicarious experiences of pain, disgust andunfairness. However, it is debated whether these regions process differentaversive events through a common modality-independent code, reflecting the sharedunpleasantness of the experiences or through independent modality-specificrepresentations. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we subjected 19participants (and 19 confederates) to equally unpleasant painful and disgustingstimulations, as well as unfair monetary treatments. Multivoxel pattern analysis identified modality-independent activation maps in the left AI and mACC, pointingto common coding of affective unpleasantness, but also response patterns specificfor the events' sensory properties and the person to whom it was addressed,particularly in the right AI. Our results provide evidence of both functionalspecialization and integration within AI and mACC, and support a comprehensiverole of this network in processing aversive experiences for self and others.
 Racism and in-group favoritism is prevalent in our society and has been studiedin Social Psychology for a long time. Recently it has become possible toinvestigate the neural mechanisms that underlie these in-group biases, and hence this review will give an overview of recent developments on the topic. Ratherthan relying on a single brain region or network, it seems that subtle changes inneural activation across the brain, depending on the modalities involved,underlie how we divide the world into 'us' versus 'them'. These insights haveimportant implications for our understanding of how in-group biases develop andcould potentially lead to new insights on how to reduce them.
 Shoaling can be considered a simple form of affective behavior displayed bysocial fish in which a single fish exhibits an tendency to approach others. Inthe present study, we adopted a dual approach to investigate shoaling behavior inthe medaka fish (Oryzias latipes): a behavioral pharmacological approach toassess mirror approaching behavior and an immunohistochemical approach to examinethe neurotransmitter distribution in the medaka telencephalon. In order to gainan insight into shoaling activity, we examined the pharmacological effects of thepositive allosteric modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) anti-anxiety drug, diazepam, and chlorpromazine, a predominantly dopaminergic antagonist onmirror approaching behavior and, in particular, mirror approaching time (MAT; atendency to shoal) and swimming distance (SWD). Diazepam dose-dependentlysuppressed MAT, but had no effect on SWD. Conversely, chlorpromazine suppressedSWD without having effects on MAT. The present study demonstrates for the firsttime that an anti-anxiety drug selectively modifies shoaling behavior in fish.Although the mechanism of this modification remains to be fully identified,immunohistochemical analysis suggests that a positive allosteric modulator ofGABA acts on two distinct telencephalic regions. Mirror approaching behaviortherefore revealed a close relationship with the action of the GABA-nergic systemand not the dopaminergic system in the medaka telencephalon.
 Experiences of social exclusion elicit social pain responses. The current studyexamined the ability of social exclusion to activate physiological stressresponses and adaptively modulate affect and empathy consistent with "defensiveemotional analgesia." Measures of affect and empathy, and saliva samples forcortisol and alpha-amylase (sAA) analysis, were collected before and aftersubjects participated in a computer game ("Cyberball") designed to manipulatefeelings of social exclusion. Contrary to our hypotheses, social exclusion wasassociated with a reduction in cortisol, and social inclusion with an increase incortisol. Both Cyberball groups showed increases in sAA and decreases in bothpositive and negative affect, with the greatest drop in affect occurring aftersocial exclusion. Empathy did not differ between the social exclusion andinclusion groups and was not correlated with cortisol or sAA levels. Theseresults support the presence of a defensive response to social exclusion in whichcentral stress pathways controlling cortisol release are inhibited. Cortisol and sAA were shown to have distinct patterns of responses to psychological stress,with sAA responding more rapidly. Related methodological concerns for the use of these physiological stress markers and of Cyberball in social neuroscienceresearch are discussed.
 Why do people take longer to associate the word "love" with outgroup words(incongruent condition) than with ingroup words (congruent condition)? Despitethe widespread use of the implicit association test (IAT), it has remainedunclear whether this IAT effect is due to additional mental processes in theincongruent condition, or due to longer duration of the same processes. Here, we addressed this previously insoluble issue by assessing the spatiotemporalevolution of brain electrical activity in 83 participants. From stimuluspresentation until response production, we identified seven processes. Crucially,all seven processes occurred in the same temporal sequence in both conditions,but participants needed more time to perform one early occurring process(perceptual processing) and one late occurring process (implementing cognitivecontrol to select the motor response) in the incongruent compared with thecongruent condition. We also found that the latter process contributed toindividual differences in implicit bias. These results advance understanding ofthe neural mechanics of response time differences in the IAT: They speak against theories that explain the IAT effect as due to additional processes in theincongruent condition and speak in favor of theories that assume a longerduration of specific processes in the incongruent condition. More broadly, ourdata analysis approach illustrates the potential of electrical neuroimaging toilluminate the temporal organization of mental processes involved in socialcognition.
 Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic condition with a distinctive social phenotypecharacterized by excessive sociability accompanied by a relative proficiency inface recognition, despite severe deficits in the visuospatial domain ofcognition. This consistent phenotypic characteristic and the relative homogeneityof the WS genotype make WS a compelling human model for examininggenotype-phenotype relations, especially with respect to social behavior.Following up on a recent report suggesting that individuals with WS do not showrace bias and racial stereotyping, this study was designed to investigate theneural correlates of the perception of faces from different races, in individualswith WS as compared to typically developing (TD) controls. Caucasian WS and TDparticipants performed a gender identification task with own-race (White) andother-race (Black) faces while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. In line with previous studies with TD participants, other-race faces elicited largeramplitude ERPs within the first 200 ms following the face onset, in WS and TDparticipants alike. These results suggest that, just like their TD counterparts, individuals with WS differentially processed faces of own-race versus other-race,at relatively early stages of processing, starting as early as 115 ms after theface onset. Overall, these results indicate that neural processing of faces inindividuals with WS is moderated by race at early perceptual stages, calling for a reconsideration of the previous claim that they are uniquely insensitive torace.
 As a fundamental concern of human beings, mortality salience impacts varioushuman social behaviors including intergroup interactions; however, the underlyingneural signature remains obscure. Here, we examined the neural signaturesunderlying the impact of mortality reminders on in-group bias in costlypunishment combining a second-party punishment task with multivariate patternanalysis of fMRI data. After mortality salience (MS) priming or general negative affect priming, participants received offers from racial in-group and out-groupproposers and decided how to punish proposers by reducing their payoffs. Werevealed that MS priming attenuated in-group bias and dampened the discriminated activation patterns pertaining to group identities in regions previouslyimplicated in costly punishment, including dorsomedial prefrontal cortex,temporo-parietal junction, anterior cingulate cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontalcortex. The group identity represented in multivariate patterns of activity ofthese regions predicted in-group bias for the control condition, i.e., thestronger discriminative representations of group identities in these regions; thelarger was the in-group bias. Furthermore, the in-group bias was reliably decodedby distributed activation patterns in the punishment-related networks but only inthe control condition and not in the MS condition. These findings elucidate theneural underpinnings of the effects of mortality reminders on intergroupinteraction. Hum Brain Mapp 38:1281-1298, 2017. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
 The developing human brain is shaped by environmental exposures--for better orworse. Many exposures relevant to mental health are genuinely social in nature orbelieved to have social subcomponents, even those related to more complexsocietal or area-level influences. The nature of how these social experiences areembedded into the environment may be crucial. Here we review select neuroscience evidence on the neural correlates of adverse and protective social exposures intheir environmental context, focusing on human neuroimaging data and supportingcellular and molecular studies in laboratory animals. We also propose theinclusion of innovative methods in social neuroscience research that may provide new and ecologically more valid insight into the social-environmental riskarchitecture of the human brain.
 Crucial advances have been made in our knowledge of the social determinants ofhealth and health behaviors. Existing research on health disparities, however,generally fails to address a known paradox in the literature: While blacks havehigher risk of medical morbidity relative to non-Hispanic whites, blacks havelower rates of common stress-related forms of psychopathology such as majordepression and anxiety disorders. In this article we propose a new theoreticalapproach, the Environmental Affordances Model, as an integrative framework forthe origins of both physical and mental health disparities. We highlight earlyempirical support and a growing body of experimental animal and human research onself-regulatory health behaviors and stress coping that is consistent with theproposed framework. We conclude that transdisciplinary approaches, such as theEnvironmental Affordances Model, are needed to understand the origins ofgroup-based disparities to implement effective solutions to racial and ethnicgroup inequalities in physical and mental health.
 Theory of mind (ToM) is a core topic in both social neuroscience anddevelopmental psychology, yet theory and data from each field have only minimallyconstrained thinking in the other. The two fields might be fruitfully integrated,however, if social neuroscientists sought evidence directly relevant to currentaccounts of ToM development: modularity, simulation, executive, and theory theoryaccounts. Here we extend the distinct predictions made by each theory to theneural level, describe neuroimaging evidence that in principle would be relevant to testing each account, and discuss such evidence where it exists. We proposethat it would be mutually beneficial for both fields if ToM neuroimaging studies focused more on integrating developmental accounts of ToM acquisition withneuroimaging approaches, and suggest ways this might be achieved.
 The brain's serotonergic system plays a crucial role in the processing ofemotional stimuli, and several studies have shown that a reduced serotonergicneurotransmission is associated with an increase in amygdala activity duringemotional face processing. Prolonged recreational use of ecstasy(3,4-methylene-dioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]) induces alterations in serotonergicneurotransmission that are comparable to those observed in a depleted state. Inthis functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we investigated theresponsiveness of the amygdala to emotional face stimuli in recreational ecstasy users as a model of long-term serotonin depletion. Fourteen ecstasy users and 12 non-using controls underwent fMRI to measure the regional neural activityelicited in the amygdala by male or female faces expressing anger, disgust, fear,sadness, or no emotion. During fMRI, participants made a sex judgement on eachface stimulus. Positron emission tomography with 11C-DASB was additionallyperformed to assess serotonin transporter (SERT) binding in the brain. In theecstasy users, SERT binding correlated negatively with amygdala activity, andaccumulated lifetime intake of ecstasy tablets was associated with an increase inamygdala activity during angry face processing. Conversely, time since the lastecstasy intake was associated with a trend toward a decrease in amygdala activityduring angry and sad face processing. These results indicate that the effects of long-term serotonin depletion resulting from ecstasy use are dose-dependent,affecting the functional neural basis of emotional face processing.
 The present study examined whether perceivers' implicit theories about thefixedness of intelligence would modulate neurophysiological responses tostereotype-violating and stereotype-confirming information. Brain activity wasrecorded using EEG as participants read a series of stereotype-confirming orstereotype-violating behaviors performed by a target character. Compared toincremental theorists (who believe that intelligence is malleable), entitytheorists (who believe that intelligence is fixed) displayed more pronounced N400responses to stereotype-violating behaviors. In contrast, incremental theoristsexhibited more pronounced N400 responses than entity theorists tostereotype-confirming behaviors. These results shed light on basic processes inPerson Memory by suggesting that perceivers make a distinction at theneurocognitive level between stereotype violations versus implicit theoryviolations.
 Although empathy is crucial for successful social interactions, excessive sharingof others' negative emotions may be maladaptive and constitute a source ofburnout. To investigate functional neural plasticity underlying the augmentation of empathy and to test the counteracting potential of compassion, one group ofparticipants was first trained in empathic resonance and subsequently incompassion. In response to videos depicting human suffering, empathy training,but not memory training (control group), increased negative affect and brainactivations in anterior insula and anterior midcingulate cortex-brain regionspreviously associated with empathy for pain. In contrast, subsequent compassiontraining could reverse the increase in negative effect and, in contrast, augment self-reports of positive affect. In addition, compassion training increasedactivations in a non-overlapping brain network spanning ventral striatum,pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex. We conclude that training compassion may reflect a new coping strategy to overcome empathicdistress and strengthen resilience.
 One of the cardinal mental faculties of humans and other primates is social brainfunction, the collective name assigned to the distributed system of socialcognitive processes that orchestrate our sophisticated adaptive social behavior. These must include processes for recognizing current social context andmaintaining an internal representation of the current social state as a referencefor decision-making. But how and where the brain processes such social-stateinformation is unknown. To home in on the neural substrates of social-staterepresentation, the activity of 196 prefrontal (PFC) neurons was recorded fromtwo monkeys simultaneously during a food-grab task under varying socialconditions. Of PFC neurons, 39% showed activity modulation during movement-freeperiods and seemed to be representing current social state. The direction ofmodulation was opposite between the dominant and submissive monkeys: Duringsocial engagement, PFC activity increased in the dominant monkey and wassuppressed in the submissive monkey. The modulation was consistently observed in additional PFC neurons (27/72) in additional pairings with two other monkeys.Notably, PFC activity in one formerly submissive monkey switched to dominantmodulation mode when he was paired with a new monkey of lower social status.These findings suggest that PFC, as part of a larger social brain network,maintains a multistate classification of social context for use as a behavioralreference for social decision-making.
 Human emotional experiences naturally occur while interacting in a spontaneous,dynamic and response contingent fashion with other humans. This resonates withboth theoretical considerations as well as neuroimaging findings that illustrate the nexus between the "social" and "emotional" brain suggesting a domain-general organization of the brain. Nevertheless, most knowledge in affective neurosciencestems from studying the brain in isolation from its natural social environment.Whether social interactions are constitutive or not to the understanding of otherpeople's intentions, incorporating such interactions is clearly required forecological validity. Moreover, since interpersonal interactions may influenceemotional experiences and expressions, interactive paradigms may advance thetheoretical understanding of what emotions are and what about them is social, andwill correspondingly characterize their underlying neural substrates. Wehighlight the recent conceptual and experimental advances of bringing realisticsocial interactions into the neuroimaging lab; review emotion-induction paradigmsand consider their congruency with features of social interactions; and emphasizethe importance of embedding such spontaneous and dynamic interactive paradigms inthe field of affective neuroscience.
 To investigate the time course of the neural processing of facial attractiveness and its influence on fairness consideration during social interactions,event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded from 21 male subjects performing atwo-person Ultimatum Game (UG). During this bargaining game, the male subjectsplayed responders who decided whether to accept offers from female proposers,whose facial images (grouped as "attractive" and "unattractive") were presentedprior to the offer presentation. The behavioral data demonstrated that theacceptance ratio increased with the fairness level of the offers and, moreimportantly, the subjects were more likely to accept unfair offers when presentedwith the attractive-face condition compared with the unattractive-face condition.The reaction times (RTs) for five offers (1:9, 2:8, 3:7, 4:6, and 5:5) in theunattractive-face condition were not significantly different. In contrast, thesubjects reacted slower to the attractive proposers' unfair offers and quicker tofair offers. The ERP analysis of the face presentation demonstrated a decreasedearly negativity (N2) and enhanced late positive potentials (LPPs) elicited bythe attractive faces compared with the unattractive faces. In addition, thefeedback-related negativity (FRN) in response to an offer presentation was notsignificantly different for the unfair (1:9 and 2:8) and fair (4:6 and 5:5)offers in the attractive-face condition. However, the unfair offers generatedlarger FRNs compared with the fair offers in the unattractive-face condition(consistent with prior studies). A similar effect was identified for P300. Thepresent study demonstrated an undermining effect of proposer facialattractiveness on responder consideration of offer fairness during the UG.
 Neuroimaging research has demonstrated that the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ)is activated when unexpected stimuli appear in spatial reorientation tasks aswell as during thinking about the beliefs of other people triggered by verbalscenarios. While the role of potential common component processes subserved bythe TPJ has been extensively studied to explain this common activation, thepotential confounding role of input modality (spatial vs. verbal) has beenlargely ignored. To investigate the role of input modality apart from taskprocesses, we developed a novel spatial false belief task based on moving shapes.We explored the overlap in TPJ activation across this novel task and traditional tasks of spatial reorientation (Posner) and verbal belief (False Belief vs. Photostories). The results show substantial overlap across the same spatial inputmodality (both reorientation and false belief) as well as across the common task process (verbal and spatial belief), but no triple overlap. This suggests thepotential for an overarching function of the TPJ, with some degree ofspecialization in different subregions due to modality, function andconnectivity. The results are discussed with respect to recent theoretical modelsof the TPJ.
 Individuals differ in their ability to understand emotional information and applythat understanding to make decisions and solve problems effectively - a constructknown as Emotional Intelligence (EI). While considerable evidence supports theimportance of EI in social and occupational functioning, the neural underpinningsof this capacity are relatively unexplored. We used Tract-Based SpatialStatistics (TBSS) to determine the white matter correlates of EI as measured bythe ability-based Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT).Participants included 32 healthy adults (16 men; 16 women), aged 18-45 years.White matter integrity in key tracts was positively correlated with the StrategicArea branches of the MSCEIT (Understanding Emotions and Managing Emotions), butnot the Experiential branches (Perceiving and Facilitating Emotions).Specifically, the Understanding Emotions branch was associated with greaterfractional anisotropy (FA) within somatosensory and sensory-motor fiber bundles, particularly those of the left superior longitudinal fasciculus and corticospinaltract. Managing Emotions was associated with greater FA within frontal-affective association tracts including the anterior forceps and right uncinate fasciculus, along with frontal-parietal cingulum and interhemispheric corpus callosum tracts.These findings suggest that specific components of EI are directly related to thestructural microarchitecture of major axonal pathways.
 Interpersonal sensitivity refers to our ability to perceive and respond with careto the internal states (e.g., cognitive, affective, motivational) of another,understand the antecedents of those states, and predict the subsequent eventsthat will result. This special issue brings together new research findings fromempirical studies, including work with adults and children, genetics, functional neuroimaging, individual differences, and behavioral measures, which examine how we process and respond to information about our fellow individuals. By combining biological and psychological approaches, social neuroscience sheds new light onthe complex and multi-faceted phenomenon of interpersonal sensitivity, including empathy. One should, however, be aware of the challenges and limits of such anapproach.
 When perceiving imminent harm to others, quickly detecting potential hazards tooneself should be vital. In this case, mirroring the outcome of observed actions appears paradoxical. This study measured electroencephalographic/event-relatedpotentials and mu suppression that were induced by dynamic animations; eachanimation was composed of three consecutive pictures depicting an individualbeing accidentally injured. The results indicated that the first picture evokedfrontal N260 and central N360, the possible brain source of which is estimated inthe dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the third picture elicited late positive potentials, the possible sources of which might be generated from the insular andmid-cingulate cortex. Differential mu suppression, in relation to thesensorimotor resonance of empathy for pain, is associated with the third picture containing the crucial affective valence, but not with the first picture. Themasking procedure on the third picture attenuated this mu suppression. Mediation analysis further confirmed that sensorimotor resonance is not a significantmediator in predicting subjective unpleasantness for observed actions. Thefindings suggest that sensorimotor resonance is not a platform, but rather anoutcome when anticipating harm to others.
 Self-report evidence suggests that consumers prefer green products (i.e.,pro-environmental) to standard products, but this is not reflected in purchasebehaviors. To understand this disconnect, we exposed participants in a magneticresonance imaging (MRI) scanner to green and standard ads. After viewing each ad,participants rated liking and perceived sustainability. Ratings were morefavorable for green ads than for control ads, but the functional MRI datasuggested an opposite pattern-participants showed greater activation in regionsassociated with personal value and reward (ventromedial prefrontal cortex andventral striatum) in response to control ads relative to green ads. In addition, participants showed greater activity in these regions to the extent that theyreported liking control ads, but there was no such trend for green ads. In linewith a neuroeconomic account, we suggest that activity in these regions may beindexing a value signal computed during message exposure that may influencedownstream purchase decisions, in contrast to self-reported evaluations that may reflect social desirability concerns absent at the point of purchase.
 For more than two decades, there have been extensive studies of experience-based neural plasticity exploring effective applications of brain plasticity forcognitive and motor development. Research suggests that human brains continuouslyundergo structural reorganization and functional changes in response tostimulations or training. From a developmental point of view, the assumption oflifespan brain plasticity has been extended to older adults in terms of thebenefits of cognitive training and physical therapy. To summarize recentdevelopments, first, we introduce the concept of neural plasticity from adevelopmental perspective. Secondly, we note that motor learning often refers to deliberate practice and the resulting performance enhancement and adaptability.We discuss the close interplay between neural plasticity, motor learning andcognitive aging. Thirdly, we review research on motor skill acquisition in older adults with, and without, impairments relative to aging-related cognitivedecline. Finally, to enhance future research and application, we highlight theimplications of neural plasticity in skills learning and cognitive rehabilitationfor the aging population.
 The field of social neuroscience has made considerable progress in unraveling theneural correlates of human cooperation by making use of brain imaging methods.Within this field, neuroeconomic research has drawn on paradigms fromexperimental economics, such as the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) and the Trust Game.These paradigms capture the topic of conflict in cooperation, while focusingstrongly on outcome-related decision processes. Cooperation, however, does notequate with that perspective, but relies on additional psychological processesand events, including shared intentions and mutually coordinated joint action.These additional facets of cooperation have been successfully addressed byresearch in developmental psychology, cognitive science, and social philosophy.Corresponding neuroimaging data, however, is still sparse. Therefore, in thispaper, we present a juxtaposition of these mutually related but mostlyindependent trends in cooperation research. We propose that the neuroscientificstudy of cooperation could benefit from paradigms and concepts employed indevelopmental psychology and social philosophy. Bringing both to a neuroimagingenvironment might allow studying the neural correlates of cooperation by usingformal models of decision-making as well as capturing the neural responses thatunderlie joint action scenarios, thus, promising to advance our understanding of the nature of human cooperation.
 Patients with schizophrenia often show abnormal social interactions, which mayexplain their social exclusion behaviors. This study aimed to elucidate patients'brain responses to social rejection in an interactive situation. Fifteen patientswith schizophrenia and 16 healthy controls participated in the functionalmagnetic resonance imaging experiment with the virtual handshake task, in whichsocially interacting contents such as acceptance and refusal of handshaking were implemented. Responses to the refusal versus acceptance conditions were evaluatedand compared between the two groups. Controls revealed higher activity in therefusal condition compared to the acceptance condition in the right superiortemporal sulcus, whereas patients showed higher activity in the prefrontalregions, including the frontopolar cortex. In patients, contrast activities ofthe right superior temporal sulcus were inversely correlated with the severity ofschizophrenic symptoms, whereas contrast activities of the left frontopolarcortex were positively correlated with the current anxiety scores. The superiortemporal sulcus hypoactivity and frontopolar hyperactivity of patients withschizophrenia in social rejection situations may suggest the presence ofmentalizing deficits in negative social situations and inefficient processes ofsocially aberrant stimuli, respectively. These abnormalities may be one of theneural bases of distorted or paranoid beliefs in schizophrenia.
 Interoception, the perception of our body internal signals, plays a key role inmaintaining homeostasis and guiding our behavior. Sometimes, we become aware ofour body signals and use them in planning and strategic thinking. Here, we showbehavioral and neural dissociations between learning to follow one's ownheartbeat and metacognitive awareness of one's performance, in aheartbeat-tapping task performed before and after auditory feedback. Theelectroencephalography amplitude of the heartbeat-evoked potential ininteroceptive learners, that is, participants whose accuracy of tapping to their heartbeat improved after auditory feedback, was higher compared withnon-learners. However, an increase in gamma phase synchrony (30-45 Hz) after the heartbeat auditory feedback was present only in those participants showingagreement between objective interoceptive performance and metacognitiveawareness. Source localization in a group of participants and direct corticalrecordings in a single patient identified a network hub for interoceptivelearning in the insular cortex. In summary, interoceptive learning may bemediated by the right insular response to the heartbeat, whereas metacognitiveawareness of learning may be mediated by widespread cortical synchronizationpatterns.
 Interest in the neural processes underlying decision making has led to a flurryof recent research in the fields of both moral psychology and neuroeconomics. In this paper, we first review some important findings from both disciplines, andthen argue that the two fields can mutually benefit each other. A more explicitrecognition of the role of values and norms will likely lead to more accuratemodels of decision making for neuroeconomists, whereas the tasks, insights intoneural mechanisms, and mathematical modeling common in neuroeconomic researchoffer moral psychologists the opportunity to expand their field and move beyondmethodological limitations that may have hindered the field's progress to thispoint. We conclude by highlighting an exciting group of recent studies thatillustrate the potential of research that embraces the integratedmoral/neuroeconomic approach that we suggest here.
 In recent years, several neuroimaging studies have suggested that the neuralbasis of the self-referential process1 is special, especially in the medialprefrontal cortex (MPFC). However, it remains controversial whether activity ofthe MPFC (and other related brain regions) appears only during theself-referential process. We investigated the neural correlates during theprocessing of references to the self, close other (friend), and distant other(prime minister) using fMRI. In comparison with baseline findings, referentialprocessing to the three kinds of persons defined above showed common activationpatterns in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), left middle temporalgyrus, left angular gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex and right cerebellum.Additionally, percent changes in BOLD signal in five regions of interestdemonstrated the same findings. The result indicated that DMPFC was not specialfor the self-referential process, while there are common neural bases forevaluating the personalities of the self and others.
 Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) is a Bayesian framework for inferring effectiveconnectivity among brain regions from neuroimaging data. While the validity ofDCM has been investigated in various previous studies, the reliability of DCMparameter estimates across sessions has been examined less systematically. Here, we report results of a software comparison with regard to test-retest reliabilityof DCM for fMRI, using a challenging scenario where complex models with manyparameters were applied to relatively few data points. Specifically, we examined the reliability of different DCM implementations (in terms of the intra-classcorrelation coefficient, ICC) based on fMRI data from 35 human subjectsperforming a simple motor task in two separate sessions, one month apart. Weconstructed DCMs of motor regions with fair to excellent reliability ofconventional activation measures. Using classical DCM (cDCM) in SPM5, we foundthat the test-retest reliability of DCM results was high, both concerning themodel evidence (ICC=0.94) and the model parameter estimates (median ICC=0.47).However, when using a more recent DCM version (DCM10 in SPM8), test-retestreliability was reduced notably. Analyses indicated that, in our particular case,the prior distributions played a crucial role in this change in reliabilityacross software versions. Specifically, when using cDCM priors for modelinversion in DCM10, this not only restored reliability but yielded even betterresults than in cDCM. Analyzing each component of the objective function in DCM, we found a selective change in the reliability of posterior mean estimates. This suggests that tighter regularization afforded by cDCM priors reduces thepossibility of local extrema in the objective function. We conclude this paperwith an outlook to ongoing developments for overcoming the software-dependency ofreliability observed in this study, including global optimization and empiricalBayesian procedures.
 Autism spectrum conditions (ASC) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterizedby abnormal social cognition. A core feature of ASC is disrupted Theory of Mind(ToM), our ability to take the mental perspective of others. ASC is alsoassociated with alexithymia, a trait characterized by altered emotionalinteroception and empathy. Here, we applied structural MRI covariance analysis toassess whether ASC and alexithymia differentially affect structural brainnetworks associated with sociocognitive and socioaffective functions. Based onprevious functional MRI findings, we expected disrupted ToM networks (centered ondorsomedial prefontal cortex [dmPFC], and temporo-parietal junction [TPJ]) inASC, while alexithymia would affect networks centered on fronto-insular cortex(FI), regions associated with interoception of emotion and empathy. Relative tocontrols, ASC indeed showed reduced covariance in networks centered on dmPFC and TPJ, but not within FI networks. Irrespective of ASC, covariance was negativelymodulated by alexithymia in networks extending from FI to posterior regions.Network findings were complemented by self-reports, indicating decreasedperspective taking but normal empathic concern in ASC. Our results show divergenteffects of ASC and alexithymia on inter-regional structural networks, suggesting that networks mediating socioaffective processes may be separable from networksmediating sociocognitive processing.
 Recent research has shown that emotion influences postural control. The objectiveof the present study was to establish whether or not postural threat influencespostural and physiological responses to aversive visual stimuli. In order toinvestigate the coupling between emotional reactions, motivated behavior andpostural responses, we studied the displacement of the subject's center ofpressure (COP) and the changes in electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate (HR)and postural muscle activation. Thirty-two participants (15 males, 17 females;mean +/- SD age: 21.4 +/- 2.3) viewed affective and neutral pictures whilestanding still on a force platform in the presence or absence of postural threat.The HR and EDA data revealed that the emotional state varied as a function of thepostural condition. The mean displacement in the anteroposterior (AP) axis wasmore rearwards in response to aversive stimuli that in response to neutralstimuli, in both the absence of postural threat (-0.65 mm and +0.90 mm foraversive and neutral stimuli, respectively) and the presence of postural threat(-0.00 mm vs. +0.89 mm, respectively). An aversive stimulus was associated with ashorter AP COP sway path than a neutral stimulus in the presence of a posturalthreat (167.26 mm vs. 174.66 mm for aversive and neutral stimuli, respectively)but not in the latter's absence (155.85 mm vs. 154.48 mm, respectively). Ourresults evidenced withdrawal behavior in response to an aversive stimulus(relative to a neutral stimulus) in the absence of postural threat. Withdrawalbehavior was attenuated (but nevertheless active) in the presence of a posturalthreat.
 Effective self-regulation requires the ability to consider alternate goal states in order to adapt to shifting circumstances. Previous research on goal reflectionhas identified goal-type dissociations in brain regions broadly associated withself-projection. Importantly, however, there is a need to distinguish activation differences due to recruitment of distinct processes from activations thatreflect common processes with varying levels of recruitment. The fact thatdifferent types of goals tend to covary naturally with time allowed us to varythe difficulty of goal reflection across content domains. Participants in an fMRIstudy thought about promotion or prevention goals at three time points. Goalsthat varied in terms of content, time-frame, valence, and abstractness but weredifficult to construct (relative to other goals) activated an area of dorsalmedial PFC, suggesting that this region may support general-purpose projectiveprocesses. In contrast, goals that were easy to construct activated a region ofdorsolateral PFC involved in domain-general memory retrieval. Importantly, wealso observed domain-specific effects of goal type and temporal distance;promotion goals were associated with heightened activity in medial PFC,short-term goals activated precuneus and anterior cingulate cortex, andlonger-term goals activated frontal areas, including ventrolateral PFC andorbitofrontal cortex.
 Time perception has been shown to be altered by emotions. This study employedevent-related potentials (ERPs) to examine the effects of two threat-relatedemotions on the judgment of time intervals in the range of 490-910 ms. Wedemonstrated that disgust and fear have distinct influences on time perception.At the behavioral level, disgusted faces were estimated longer and fearful faces were estimated shorter (i.e., the generalization gradient for the disgusted faceswas shifted left while the generalization gradient for the fearful faces wasshifted right) when compared with neutral faces. Accordingly, the contingentnegative variation, an online ERP index of timing, displayed larger area indisgust and smaller area in fear conditions when compared with neutral condition (disgust = 1.94 +/- 2.35 muV*s, neutral = 1.40 +/- 2.5 muV*s, and fear = 1.00 +/-2.26 muV*s). These findings indicated that specific neural mechanisms mayunderlie the attention effects of different subtypes of threat-related emotionson timing; compared with neutral faces, fearful faces are likely to attract more attentional resources while disgusted faces may attract less attentionalresources for emotional processing. The major contribution of the current studyis to provide neural correlates of fear vs. disgust divergence in the aspect oftime perception and to demonstrate beyond the behavioral level that thecategorization of threat-related emotions should be refined so to highlight theadaptability of the human defense system.
 Mental health problems, such as depression, are increasingly common amongworkers. Job-related stresses, including psychological demands and a lack ofdiscretion in controlling one's own work environment, are important causalfactors. However, the mechanisms through which job-related stress may affectbrain function remain unknown. We sought to identify the relationship betweenjob-related stress and frontotemporal cortex activation using near-infraredspectroscopy. Seventy-nine (45 females, 34 males) Japanese employees, aged 26-51 years, were recruited from respondents to the Japanese Study of Stratification,Health, Income, and Neighborhood survey. Job-related stress was measured usingthe Japanese version of Job Content Questionnaire, which can index "job demand"and "job control". We found a significant correlation between higher "job demand"and smaller oxygenated hemoglobin [oxy-Hb] changes in the left dorsolateralprefrontal cortex in female (r = -.54 to -.44). Significant correlations between higher "job control" and greater [oxy-Hb] changes in the right temporal cortexwere observed among male, and in the combined sample (r = .46-.64). This initial cross-sectional observation suggests that elevated job-related stress is related to decrease frontotemporal cortex activation among workers. Integrating socialepidemiology and neuroscience may be a powerful strategy for understanding howindividuals' brain functions may mediate between the job-related stress orpsychosocial work characteristics and public mental health.
 Emotional processing deficits have recently been identified in individuals withtraumatic brain injury (TBI), specifically in the domain of facial affectrecognition. However, the neural networks underlying these impairments have yetto be identified. In the current study, 42 individuals with moderate to severeTBI and 23 healthy controls performed a task of facial affect recognition (FacialEmotion Identification Test (FEIT)) in order to assess their ability to identify and discriminate six emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, shame, andfear. These individuals also underwent structural neuroimaging includingdiffusion tensor imaging to examine white matter (WM) integrity. Correlationalanalyses were performed to determine where in the brain WM damage was associated with performance on the facial affect recognition task. Reduced performance onthe FEIT was associated with reduced WM integrity (fractional anisotropy, meandiffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity) in the inferiorlongitudinal fasciculus and inferior-fronto-occipital fasciculus in individualswith TBI. Poor performance on the task was additionally associated with reducedgray matter (GM) volume in lingual gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus. The resultsimplicate a pattern of WM and GM damage in TBI that may play a role in emotional processing impairments.
 It is now common practice, in digital communication, to use the charactercombination ":-)", known as an emoticon, to indicate a smiling face. Althoughemoticons are readily interpreted as smiling faces, it is unclear whetheremoticons trigger face-specific mechanisms or whether separate systems areutilized. A hallmark of face perception is the utilization of regions in theoccipitotemporal cortex, which are sensitive to configural processing. Werecorded the N170 event-related potential to investigate the way in whichemoticons are perceived. Inverting faces produces a larger and later N170 whileinverting objects which are perceived featurally rather than configurally reducesthe amplitude of the N170. We presented 20 participants with images of uprightand inverted faces, emoticons and meaningless strings of characters. Emoticonsshowed a large amplitude N170 when upright and a decrease in amplitude wheninverted, the opposite pattern to that shown by faces. This indicates that whenupright, emoticons are processed in occipitotemporal sites similarly to faces dueto their familiar configuration. However, the characters which indicate thephysiognomic features of emoticons are not recognized by the more laterallyplaced facial feature detection systems used in processing inverted faces.
 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Suicide attempts are usually regretted by people who survivethem. Furthermore, addiction and gambling are over-represented among people whoattempt or die by suicide, raising the question whether their decision-making is impaired. Advances in decision neuroscience have enabled us to investigatedecision processes in suicidal people and to elucidate putative neural substratesof disadvantageous decision-making. RECENT FINDINGS: Early studies have linkedattempted suicide to poor performance on gambling tasks. More recently,functional MRI augmented with a reinforcement learning computational modelrevealed that impaired decision-making in suicide attempters is paralleled bydisrupted expected value (expected reward) signals in the ventromedial prefrontalcortex. Behavioral studies have linked increased delay discounting tolow-lethality/poorly planned attempts, multiple attempts, and the co-occurrenceof attempted suicide and addiction. This behavioral tendency may be related toaltered integrity of the basal ganglia. By contrast, well-planned, serioussuicide attempts were associated with intact/diminished delay discounting. Onestudy has linked high-lethality suicide attempts and impaired socialdecision-making. SUMMARY: This emerging literature supports the notion thatvarious impairments in decision-making - often broadly related to impulsivity -may mark different pathways to suicide. We propose that aggressive andself-destructive responses to social stressors in people prone to suicide result from a predominance of automatic, Pavlovian processes over goal-directedcomputations.
 The neural correlates of the perception of faces from different races wereinvestigated. White participants performed a gender identification task in which Asian, Black, and White faces were presented while event-related potentials(ERPs) were recorded. Participants also completed an implicit association taskfor Black (IAT-Black) and Asian (IAT-Asian) faces. ERPs evoked by Black and Whitefaces differed, with Black faces evoking a larger positive ERP that peaked at 168ms over the frontal scalp, and White faces evoking a larger negative ERP thatpeaked at 244 ms. These Black/White ERP differences significantly correlated withparticipants' scores on the IAT-Black. ERPs also differentiated White from Asian faces and a significant correlation was obtained between the White-Asian ERPdifference waves at approximately 500 ms and the IAT-Asian. A positive ERP at 116ms over occipital scalp differentiated all three races, but was not correlatedwith either IAT. In addition, a late positive component (around 592 ms) wasgreater for the same race compared to either other race faces, suggestingpotentially more extended or deeper processing of the same race faces. Takentogether, the ERP/IAT correlations observed for both other races indicate theinfluence of a race-sensitive evaluative process that may include early moreautomatic and/or implicit processes and relatively later more controlledprocesses.
 Baron-Cohen (1995) proposed that the theory of mind (ToM) inference systemevolved to promote strategic social interaction. Social exchange--a form ofco-operation for mutual benefit--involves strategic social interaction andrequires ToM inferences about the contents of other individuals' mental states,especially their desires, goals, and intentions. There are behavioral andneuropsychological dissociations between reasoning about social exchange andreasoning about equivalent problems tapping other, more general content domains. It has therefore been proposed that social exchange behavior is regulated bysocial contract algorithms: a domain-specific inference system that isfunctionally specialized for reasoning about social exchange. We report an fMRIstudy using the Wason selection task that provides further support for thishypothesis. Precautionary rules share so many properties with social exchangerules--they are conditional, deontic, and involve subjective utilities--that mostreasoning theories claim they are processed by the same neurocomputationalmachinery. Nevertheless, neuroimaging shows that reasoning about social exchange activates brain areas not activated by reasoning about precautionary rules, andvice versa. As predicted, neural correlates of ToM (anterior and posteriortemporal cortex) were activated when subjects interpreted social exchange rules, but not precautionary rules (where ToM inferences are unnecessary). We argue thatthe interaction between ToM and social contract algorithms can be reciprocal:social contract algorithms requires ToM inferences, but their functional logicalso allows ToM inferences to be made. By considering interactions between ToM inthe narrower sense (belief-desire reasoning) and all the social inference systemsthat create the logic of human social interaction--ones that enable as well asuse inferences about the content of mental states--a broader conception of ToMmay emerge: a computational model embodying a Theory of Human Nature (ToHN).
 It has been shown that a smaller ratio between the length of the second andfourth digit (2D:4D) is an indicator of the exposure to prenatal testosterone(T). This study measured the 2D:4D of men and assessed dominance as a personalitytrait to investigate indirectly if the exposure to prenatal T is related to adominant personality later in life. Results showed that men had a more aggressivedominant personality when having a more masculine (lower) 2D:4D, while there was no relationship between sociable dominance and 2D:4D. Findings from this studyindicate that it is important to distinguish different forms of dominance sinceother studies failed to find relationships between dominance and 2D:4D.
 Morality and empathy are both crucial in building human society. Yet therelationship between them has been merely explored. The present study revealedhow the morality influenced empathy for pain by comparing the ERPs elicited bypictures showing the targets' in pain primed by different moral information aboutthe targets. We found that when the target was a moral one or a neutral one, the painful pictures elicited significantly larger amplitude in N2 than thenon-painful pictures, but when the target was an immoral one, the differencebetween the amplitudes of N2 component elicited by painful and non-painfulpictures became insignificant. We proposed that this effect was induced by thedecreased affective arousal when observing an immoral person in pain. The reducedneural response towards the immoral one's pain can keep us alert when we face thepotentially dangerous people thereby increasing our chance of survival. SLORTEAresults showed the source of this difference in N2 localized in the ventralmedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC)areas.
 Difficulty with emotion perception is a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that is also associated with the broader autism phenotype. The currentstudy explored the neural underpinnings of conscious and nonconscious perceptionsof affect in typically developing individuals with varying levels ofautistic-like traits, as measured by the Autism Quotient (AQ). We investigatedthe relationship between autistic traits and face processing efficiency usingevent-related potentials (ERPs). In 20 typically developing adults, we utilizedERPs (the P100, N170, and P300) to measure differences in face processing foremotional faces that were presented either (a) too quickly to reach consciousawareness (16 ms) or (b) slowly enough to be consciously observed (200 ms). Allindividuals evidenced increased P100 and P300 amplitude and shorter N170latencies for nonconscious versus consciously presented faces. Individuals withhigh AQ scores evidenced delayed ERP components. Nonconsciously perceivedemotional faces elicited enhanced neural responses regardless of AQ score. Higherlevels of autistic traits were associated with inefficient face perception (i.e.,longer latency of ERP components). This delay parallels processing delaysobserved in ASD. These data suggest that inefficient social perception is presentin individuals with subclinical levels of social impairment.
 The ability of animals to perform transitive inference is associated with social group formation and dominance hierarchies. Brain lateralization is also linked tothe selective pressures associated with social life. We investigated whethertransitive inference is better performed by lateralized than non-lateralizedbrains. In the domestic chick (Gallus gallus) exposure of eggs to light beforehatching leads to the development of lateralization of some visual functions.Thus, it is possible to obtain chicks with strong (light-incubated, Li-chicks) orweak (dark-incubated, Di-chicks) lateralization. Di- and Li-chicks were trainedto discriminate stimulus pairs, in order to build a hierarchy (A > B > C > D >E). Chicks were subsequently tested on stimulus pairs never seen together before (AE and BD). Li-chicks performed the discrimination BD better than did Di-chicks,suggesting that exposure to light in the egg leads to an increased ability tocarry out representational learning. Moreover, lateralized chicks using theirleft eye only (right hemisphere) during test showed a better performance than didright eye only (left hemisphere) chicks on the BD task. Females also tended toperform better than males. Results demonstrate that chicks with lateralized brainhemispheres show greater inference, and this is under right hemisphere control:the brain hemisphere that is dominant in social interactions.
 The impact of emotions on gaze-oriented attention was investigated in non-anxiousparticipants. A neutral face cue with straight gaze was presented, which thenaverted its gaze to the side while remaining neutral or expressing an emotion(fear/surprise in Exp.1 and anger/happiness in Exp.2). Localization of asubsequent target was faster at the gazed-at location (congruent condition) than at the non-gazed-at location (incongruent condition). This Gaze-Orienting Effect (GOE) was enhanced for fear, surprise, and anger, compared to neutral expressionswhich did not differ from happy expressions. In addition, Event RelatedPotentials (ERPs) to the target showed a congruency effect on P1 for fear andsurprise and a left lateralized congruency effect on P1 for happy faces,suggesting that target visual processing was also influenced by attention to gazeand emotions. Finally, at cue presentation, early postero-lateral (EarlyDirecting Attention Negativity (EDAN)) and later antero-lateral (AnteriorDirecting Attention Negativity (ADAN)) attention-related ERP components wereobserved, reflecting, respectively, the shift of attention and its holding atgazed-at locations. These two components were not modulated by emotions.Together, these findings show that the processing of social signals such as gaze and facial expression interact rather late and in a complex manner to modulatespatial attention.
 Research demonstrates that social preferences are characterized by significantindividual differences. An important question, often overlooked, is from where dothese individual differences originate? And what are the processes that underlie such differences? In this paper, we outline the neural trait approach touncovering sources of individual differences in social preferences, particularly as evidenced in economic games. We focus on two primary methods-resting-stateelectroencephalography and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-used byresearchers to quantify task-independent, brain-based characteristics that arestable over time. We review research that has employed these methods toinvestigate social preferences with an emphasis on a key psychological process insocial decision-making; namely, self-control. We then highlight futureopportunities for the neural trait approach in cutting-edge decision-makingresearch. Finally, we explore the debate about self-control in socialdecision-making and the potential role neural trait research could play in thisissue.
 The ability to generate and sustain an internal train of thought unrelated toexternal reality frees an agent from the constraints of only acting on immediate,environmentally triggered events. The current paper proposes that such thought isproduced through cooperation between autobiographical information provided by thedefault mode network and a frontal-parietal control network which helps sustainand buffer internal trains of thought against disruption by the external world.This hypothesis explains at least two features of the literature on internallyguided thought. First, access to the top-down control system is a generallyaccepted prerequisite of conscious experience; this explains why activation ofthis system and default mode activity is often observed together during periodsof internally guided thought. Second, because the top-down attentional controlsystem has a limited capacity, internally and externally driven streams can come into conflict, with the result that perceptual information must be deniedattentional amplification if the internal stream is to be maintained. Thisexplains why internal thought is routinely associated with a state of perceptual decoupling, reflected in both measured anticorrelations between the default mode network and sensory areas and the manner in which task unrelated thoughtscompromise task performance. This paper offers a hypothesis that should help toconstrain and guide interpretations, investigations, and analyses of the neuralprocesses involved in internally driven cognition. This article is part of aSpecial Issue entitled Special Issue The Cognitive Neuroscience.
 Explaining how, and even why, the social brain experiences empathy is a complexintegrative endeavor that has been explored by scientists of several disciplines working with both animal and human subjects. Current thoughts on empathy and its connection to behavior-prosocial, altruistic, and cruel alike-were explored byscholars in the fields of biology, philosophy, psychology, and anthropology at a conference in Chicago. The speakers' individually unique perspectives merged toprovide an inclusive overview of the biological basis of, and cultural influencesupon, empathy. The nature of empathy in nonhuman animals, the endocrinerequirements for empathy,the effects of empathy on moral behavior, the socialnature of pain, the relation between empathy and altruism,the ethnography ofempathy, and empathy in the medical setting were discussed. The interdisciplinarynature of the conference demonstrated the advantages of communicating findingsacross fields while also delineating the difficulties that can stem from theexistence of multiple approaches to, and definitions of, empathy. Future progresswill be aided by working toward common definitions for empathy, sympathy,altruism, and so on, in concert with cross-disciplinary dialogues that allowpractitioners of each discipline to be informed by paradigms and findings fromcomplementary disciplines.
 BACKGROUND: The role of theory of mind (ToM) in autism spectrum disorders andother communication impairments has been an active area of research in the last30 years. Advances in neuroimaging in the last 10 years have led to the rise ofthe field of social neuroscience, which has markedly increased the understanding of the neurophysiological/neuroanatomical and neurochemical nature of ToMfunctioning and deficits in typically developing individuals and in children and adults with a variety of social and communication impairments. OBJECTIVE: Thegoal of this paper is to (a) describe the current concepts of ToM based onneuroscience research, and (b) present a framework for the dimensions of ToM thathave been identified, which can be used to guide assessment and intervention for persons with deficits in ToM that affect social interactions. SUMMARY: Thisarticle presents neuroscience research that has documented theneurophysiological/neuroanatomical bases for cognitive and affective ToM andinterpersonal and intrapersonal ToM as well as neurochemical and epigeneticinfluences on ToM. This information provides an important framework for assessingToM deficits in persons with social and communication impairments and developing interventions that target the specific dimensions of ToM deficits.
 Social exclusion is so aversive that it causes broad cognitive and behavioralchanges to regulate the individual's belonging status. The present study examinedwhether such changes also occur at early neural or automatic behavioral levels inresponse to social cues. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and facialelectromyograms (EMGs) were recorded during a task in which participants viewedsmiling, disgusted, and neutral faces after experiencing social exclusion orinclusion. Social exclusion was manipulated using a simple ball-tossing game(Cyberball), and need threat was assessed after the game. We found thatzygomaticus major muscle activity, which reflects facial mimicry, was larger inresponse to smiling faces after exclusion than after inclusion. In addition, P1amplitude, which reflects visual attention, was larger for disgusted faces thanfor neutral faces following social exclusion. N170 amplitude, which reflectsstructural encoding of the face, was correlated with heightened need threat.These findings demonstrate that social exclusion induces immediate and rapidchanges in attention, perception, and automatic behavior. These findings reflect the rapid and primary regulation of belonging.
 The authors propose a heuristic model of the social outcomes of childhood braindisorder that draws on models and methods from both the emerging field of social cognitive neuroscience and the study of social competence in developmentalpsychology/psychopathology. The heuristic model characterizes the relationshipsbetween social adjustment, peer interactions and relationships, social problemsolving and communication, social-affective and cognitive-executive processes,and their neural substrates. The model is illustrated by research on a specificform of childhood brain disorder, traumatic brain injury. The heuristic model maypromote research regarding the neural and cognitive-affective substrates ofchildren's social development. It also may engender more precise methods ofmeasuring impairments and disabilities in children with brain disorder andsuggest ways to promote their social adaptation.
 Time perception is a fundamental component of everyday life. Although time can bemeasured using standard units, the relationship between an individual'sexperience of perceived time and a standard unit is highly sensitive to context. Stressful and threatening stimuli have been previously shown to produce timedistortion effects, such that individuals perceive the stimuli as lasting fordifferent amounts of time as compared to a standard unit. As a highly socialspecies, humans are acutely sensitive to social stressors; however, timedistortion effects have not been studied in the context of social stress. Wecollected psychophysiological (electrocardiogram and impedance cardiography) and time perception data before, during, and after a modified version of the TrierSocial Stress Test for 42 participants. Based on prior theories and evidence fromthe time perception literature, we hypothesized that experiencing a stressfulevent would result in time distortion. This hypothesis was supported by the data,with individuals on average reproducing short and long duration negative andpositive stimuli as lasting longer after experiencing social stress, t(41) =-3.55, p = .001, and t(41) = -4.12, p < .001 for negative stimuli, and t(41) =-2.43, p = .02, and t(41) = -3.07, p = .004 for positive stimuli. However,changes in time perception were largely unrelated to psychophysiologicalreactivity to social stress. These findings are in line with some other studiesof time distortion, and provide evidence for the interoceptive salience model of time perception. Implications for mechanisms of time distortion are discussed.
 Mate choice is an example of sophisticated daily decision making supported bymultiple componential processes. In mate-choice literature, differentcharacteristics of the value dimensions, including the sex difference in thevalue dimensions, and the involvement of self-assessment due to the mutual natureof the choice, have been suggested. We examined whether the brain-activationpattern during virtual mate choice would be congruent with these characteristics in terms of stimulus selectivity and activated brain regions. In measuring brain activity, young men and women were shown two pictures of either faces orbehaviors, and they indicated which person they would choose either as a spouseor as a friend. Activation selective to spouse choice was observedface-selectively in men's amygdala and behavior-selectively in women's motorsystem. During both partner-choice conditions, behavior-selective activation was observed in the temporoparietal regions. Taking the available knowledge of these regions into account, these results are congruent with the suggestedcharacteristics of value dimensions for physical attractiveness, parentingresources, and beneficial personality traits for a long-lasting relationship,respectively. The medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices werenonselectively activated during the partner choices, suggesting the involvementof a self-assessment process. The results thus provide neuroscientific supportfor the multi-component mate-choice mechanism.
 In this paper, I start by suggesting a new definition of empathy. I go on byanswering the question of "Who feels empathy?". I list some examples of people,illustrating how the level of feeling empathy differs from one category of peopleto another. It's actually almost everybody who feels empathy: the baby, the good Samaritan and the other two priests, the tax evader, the psychopath, the judges, juries, lawyers, the politician, the bully adolescent, the therapist, etc....Then I explain, "Why empathy is experienced/felt differently?", by drawing onsome neuroscience data, and some literature in psychology or philosophy alongwith some personal suggestions or assumptions. Just to mention one plausibledata: we know that the human brain is half developed at birth. It takes twelve tofourteen years for the brain to fully develop. And the frontal lobe continues to develop until the third decade of life! I suggest we must attend to these phases of brain development to learn empathy since that is when the plasticity of thebrain and the learning kick-in. Hence, the third section of the paperdemonstrates "How can we develop an empathic mind/behaviour given the nature ofour empathic brain?": with some supportive research and studies, I justify thestatement that "ideally from early age, and all the way up to adulthood, empathy can be learned through nurturing, education, imitation..., through alternativerealities such as mindfulness and awareness, and through therapy, memoryimprovement, training programs, etc...." In the conclusion, I assert, using some philosophical thoughts and analogies, that a fully developed empathic behaviour, that embraces all three aspects cognitive, affective and compassionate empathy,being the opposite of indifference, is the vehicle to a peaceful, harmonious and just society.
 The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is functionally linked to a variety of cognitiveand emotional functions. In particular, lesions of the human OFC lead tolarge-scale changes in social and emotional behavior. For example, patients with OFC lesions are reported to suffer from deficits in affective decision-making,including impaired emotional face and voice expression recognition (e.g., Hornak et al., 1996, 2003). However, previous studies have failed to acknowledge thatemotional processing is a multistage process. Thus, different stages of emotionalprocessing (e.g., early vs. late) in the same patient group could be affected in a qualitatively different manner. The present study investigated this possibilityand tested implicit emotional speech processing in an ERP experiment followed by an explicit behavioral emotional recognition task. OFC patients listened to vocalemotional expressions of anger, fear, disgust, and happiness compared to aneutral baseline spoken either with or without lexical content. In line withprevious evidence (Paulmann & Kotz, 2008b), both patients and healthy controlsdifferentiate emotional and neutral prosody within 200 ms (P200). However, therecognition of emotional vocal expressions is impaired in OFC patients ascompared to healthy controls. The current data serve as first evidence thatemotional prosody processing is impaired only at a late, and not at an earlyprocessing stage in OFC patients.
 The fronto-parietal network has been implicated in the processing of multisensoryinformation for motor control. Recent methodological advances with both fMRI and TMS provide the opportunity to dissect the functionality of this extensivenetwork in humans and may identify distinct contributions of local neuralpopulations within this circuit that are not only related to motor planning, but to goal oriented behavior as a whole. Herein, we review and make parallelsbetween experiments in monkeys and humans on a broad array of motor as well asnon-motor tasks in order to characterize the specific contribution of a region inthe parietal lobe, the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS). The intent of thisarticle is to review: (1) the historical perspectives on the parietal lobe,particularly the aIPS; (2) extend and update these perspectives based on recentempirical data; and (3) discuss the potential implications of the revisedfunctionality of the aIPS in relationship to complex goal oriented behavior andsocial interaction. Our contention is that aIPS is a critical node within anetwork involved in the higher order dynamic control of action, includingrepresentation of intended action goals. These findings may be important not onlyfor guiding the design of future experiments investigating related issues but mayalso have valuable utility in other fields, such social neuroscience andbiomedical engineering.
 Several componential emotion theories suggest that appraisal outcomes triggercharacteristic somatovisceral changes that facilitate information processing and prepare the organism for adaptive behavior. The current study tested predictions derived from Scherer's Component Process Model. Participants viewed unpleasantand pleasant pictures (intrinsic pleasantness appraisal) and were asked toconcurrently perform either an arm extension or an arm flexion, leading to anincrease or a decrease in picture size. Increasing pleasant stimuli anddecreasing unpleasant stimuli were considered goal conducive; decreasing pleasantstimuli and increasing unpleasant stimuli were considered goal obstructive (goal conduciveness appraisal). Both appraisals were marked by several somatovisceralchanges (facial electromyogram, heart rate (HR)). As predicted, the changesinduced by the two appraisals showed similar patterns. Furthermore, HR results,compared with data of earlier studies, suggest that the adaptive consequences of both appraisals may be mediated by stimulus proximity.
 Mindfulness can be viewed as an important dispositional characteristic thatreflects the tendency to be mindful in daily life, which is beneficial forimproving individuals' both hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. However, no study to date has examined the brain regions involved in individual differences indispositional mindfulness during the resting state and its relation with hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. To investigate this issue, the present study employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to evaluate theregional homogeneity (ReHo) that measures the local synchronization ofspontaneous brain activity in a large sample. We found that dispositionalmindfulness was positively associated with the ReHo in the left orbitofrontalcortex (OFC), left parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), and right insula implicated inemotion processing, body awareness, and self-referential processing, andnegatively associated with the ReHo in right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)implicated in response inhibition and attentional control. Furthermore, we found different neural associations with hedonic (i.e., positive and negative affect)and eudaimonic well-being (i.e., the meaningful and purposeful life).Specifically, the ReHo in the IFG predicted eudaimonic well-being whereas the OFCpredicted positive affect, both of which were mediated by dispositionalmindfulness. Taken together, our study provides the first evidence for linkingindividual differences in dispositional mindfulness to spontaneous brain activityand demonstrates that dispositional mindfulness engages multiple brain mechanismsthat differentially influence hedonic and eudaimonic well-being.
 Coding the direction of others' gestures is a fundamental human ability, since itallows the observer to attend and react to sources of potential interest in theenvironment. Shifts of attention triggered by action observation have beenreported to occur early in infancy. Yet, the neurophysiological underpinnings of such action priming and the properties of gestures that might be crucial for itremain unknown. Here, we addressed these issues by recordingelectroencephalographic activity (EEG) from 6-month-old infants cued withspatially non-predictive hand grasping toward or away from the position of atarget object, i.e., valid and invalid trials, respectively. Half of the infants were cued with a gesture executable by a human hand (possible gesture) and theother half with a gesture impossible to be executed by a human hand. Results showthat the amplitude enhancement of the posterior N290 component in response totargets in valid trials, as compared to invalid trials, was present only forinfants seeing possible gestures, while it was absent for infants seeingimpossible gestures. These findings suggest that infants detect the biomechanicalproperties of human movements when processing hand gestures, relying on thisinformation to orient their visual attention toward the target object.
 Previous behavioral research has revealed a positivity effect that occurs withaging, with older adults focusing more on positive information and less onnegative emotional stimuli as compared to young adults. Questions have beenraised as to whether this effect exists in the rapid detection of information or whether it operates only at later stages of processing. In the present study, we used eye-tracking and neuroimaging methodologies to examine whether the two agegroups accomplished the detection of emotional information on a visual searchtask using the same mechanisms. Eye-tracking results revealed no significant age differences in detection or viewing time of emotional targets as a function ofvalence. Despite their general similarity in task performance, neuroimagingresults revealed an age-related valence-based reversal in medial prefrontalcortex (MPFC) activity, with detection of negative compared to positive targetsactivating the MPFC more for younger adults, and detection of positive comparedto negative targets activating the MPFC more for older adults. These resultssuggest that age-related valence reversals in neural activity can exist even ontasks that require only relatively automatic processing of emotional information.
 Observing another person performing an action can lead to a false memory ofhaving performed the action oneself - the observation-inflation effect. In theexperimental paradigm, participants first perform or do not perform simpleactions, and then observe another person perform some of these actions. Theobservation-inflation effect is found when participants later remember performingactions that they have merely observed. In this case, self and other are confusedin action memory. We examined social conditions of this self-other confusion whenremembering actions, specifically whether the effect depends on the observedactor's group membership. In our experiment, we manipulated group membershipbased on physical appearance, specifically complexion of the hands. Fair-skinned participants observed either an in-group (i.e., fair-skinned) or an out-group(i.e., dark-skinned) actor. Our results revealed that the observed actor's group membership moderated the observation-inflation effect: False memories weresignificantly reduced when the actor was from the out-group (vs. in-group). Wefound no difference to a control condition in which the actor wore black gloves, suggesting that distinctiveness of perceptual or sensory features alone (due tothe out-group member's dark skin) is not critical. We discuss these findings inlight of social-neuroscience studies demonstrating the impact of an observedperson's group membership on motor simulation. Overall, our findings suggest thataction memory can be affected by a ubiquitous feature of people's socialperception, that is, group-based social categorization of others.
 Across-brain neurodynamic organizations arise when teams perform coordinatedtasks. We describe a symbolic electroencephalographic (EEG) approach thatidentifies when team neurodynamic organizations occur and demonstrate its utilitywith scientific problem solving and submarine navigation tasks. Each second,neurodynamic symbols (NS) were created showing the 1-40 Hz EEG power spectraldensities for each team member. These data streams contained a performancehistory of the team's across-brain neurodynamic organizations. The degree ofneurodynamic organization was calculated each second from a moving window averageof the Shannon entropy over the task. Decreased NS entropy (i.e., greaterneurodynamic organization) was prominent in the ~16 Hz EEG bins during problemsolving, while during submarine navigation, the maximum NS entropy decreases were~10 Hz and were associated with establishing the ship's location. Decreased NSentropy also occurred in the 20-40 Hz bins of both teams and was associated with uncertainty or stress. The highest mutual information levels, calculated from theEEG values of team dyads, were associated with decreased NS entropy, suggesting alink between these two measures. These studies show entropy and mutualinformation mapping of symbolic EEG data streams from teams can be useful foridentifying organized across-brain team activation patterns.
 Researchers have examined representations of the body in the adult brain butrelatively little attention has been paid to ontogenetic aspects of neural bodymaps in human infants. Novel applications of methods for recording brain activityin infants are delineating cortical body maps in the first months of life. Bodymaps may facilitate infants' registration of similarities between self and other - an ability that is foundational to developing social cognition. Alterations in interpersonal aspects of body representations might also contribute to socialdeficits in certain neurodevelopmental disorders.
 The degree to which others in our environment influence sensorimotor processinghas been a particular focus of cognitive neuroscience for the past two decades.This process of self-other resonance, or shared body representation, has onlyrecently been extended to more global bodily processes such as self-location,self-motion perception, balance and perspective taking. In this review, weoutline these previously overlooked areas of research to bridge the distinctfield of social neuroscience with global self-perception, vestibular processingand postural control. Firstly, we outline research showing that the presence and movement of others can modulate two fundamental experiences of the self:self-location (the experience of where the self is located in space) andself-motion perception (the experience that oneself has moved or has been movedin space). Secondly, we outline recent research that has shown perturbations inbalance control as a result of instability in others in our environment.Conversely to this, we also highlight studies in virtual reality demonstratingthe potential benefits of the presence of others in our environment for thoseundergoing vestibular rehabilitation. Thirdly, we outline studies of first- andthird-person perspective taking, which is the ability to have or take avisuo-spatial perspective within and out-with the confines of our own body. Thesestudies demonstrate a contamination of perspective taking processes (i.e.automatic, implicit, third-person perspective taking) in the presence of others. This collection of research highlights the importance of social cues in the more global processing of the self and its accompanying sensory inputs, particularlyvestibular signals. Future research will need to better determine the mechanisms of self-other resonance within these processes, including the role of individual differences in the susceptibility to the influence of another.
 The prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) is an important model organism for thestudy of social behavior, yet our ability to correlate genes and behavior in thisspecies has been limited due to a lack of genetic and genomic resources. Here we report the BAC-based targeted sequencing of behaviorally-relevant genes andflanking regions in the prairie vole. A total of 6.4 Mb of non-redundant orhaplotype-specific sequence assemblies were generated that span the partial orcomplete sequence of 21 behaviorally-relevant genes as well as an additional 55flanking genes. Estimates of nucleotide diversity from 13 loci based onalignments of 1.7 Mb of haplotype-specific assemblies revealed an averagepair-wise heterozygosity (8.4x10(-3)). Comparative analyses of the prairie voleproteins encoded by the behaviorally-relevant genes identified >100 substitutionsspecific to the prairie vole lineage. Finally, our sequencing data indicate that a duplication of the prairie vole AVPR1A locus likely originated from a recentsegmental duplication spanning a minimum of 105 kb. In summary, the results ofour study provide the genomic resources necessary for the molecular and geneticcharacterization of a high-priority set of candidate genes for regulating social behavior in the prairie vole.
 Individualism and collectivism, or self-construal style, refer to cultural valuesthat influence how people think about themselves and their relation to the socialand physical environment. Recent neuroimaging evidence suggests that culturalvalues of individualism and collectivism dynamically modulate neural responsewithin cortical midline structures, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), during explicit self-evaluation. However,it remains unknown whether cultural priming modulates neural response duringself-evaluation due to explicit task demands. Here we investigated how culturalpriming of self-construal style affects neural activity within cortical midlinestructures during implicit self-evaluation in bicultural individuals. Resultsindicate that ventral MPFC showed relatively less deactivation during implicitevaluation of both self- and father-relevant information as compared to controlcondition (e.g., information of an unfamiliar person), irrespective of culturalpriming. By contrast, dorsal MPFC showed relatively less deactivation duringimplicit evaluation of father-relevant information, but not self-relevantinformation, as compared to control condition, only when they were primed withindividualism. Furthermore, dorsal MPFC showed relatively less deactivationduring implicit evaluation of father-relevant information as compared toself-relevant condition only when they were primed with individualism. Hence, ourresults indicate that cultural priming modulates neural response within dorsal,but not ventral, portions of MPFC in a stimulus-driven rather than task-drivenmanner. More broadly, these findings suggest that cultural values dynamicallyshape neural representations during the evaluation, rather than the detection, ofself-relevant information.
 An enduring question is unity vs. separability of executive deficits resultingfrom impaired frontal lobe function. In previous studies, we have asked howexecutive deficits link to a conventional measure of fluid intelligence, obtainedeither by standard tests of novel problem-solving, or by averaging performance ina battery of novel tasks. For some classical executive tasks, such as theWisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Verbal Fluency, and Trail Making Test B(TMTB), frontal deficits are entirely explained by fluid intelligence. However,on a second set of executive tasks, including tests of multitasking and decision making, deficits exceed those predicted by fluid intelligence loss. In this paperwe discuss how these results shed light on the diverse clinical phenomenologyobserved in frontal dysfunction, and present new data on a group of 15schizophrenic patients and 14 controls. Subjects were assessed with a range ofexecutive tests and with a general cognitive battery used to derive a measure of fluid intelligence. Group performance was compared and fluid intelligence wasintroduced as a covariate. In line with our previous results, significantpatient-control differences in classical executive tests were removed when fluid intelligence was introduced as a covariate. However, for tests of multitaskingand decision making, deficits remained. We relate our findings to those ofprevious factor analytic studies describing a single principal component, whichaccounts for much of the variance of schizophrenic patients' cognitiveperformance. We propose that this general factor reflects low fluid intelligence capacity, which accounts for much but not all cognitive impairment in thispatient group. Partialling out the general effects of fluid intelligence, wepropose, may clarify the role of additional, more specific cognitive impairments in conditions such as schizophrenia.
 People are generally better at remembering faces of their own race than faces of a different race, and this effect is known as the own-race bias (ORB) effect. We used eye-tracking and pupillometry to investigate whether Caucasian and Asianface stimuli elicited different-looking patterns in Caucasian participants in aface-memory task. Consistent with the ORB effect, we found better recognitionperformance for own-race faces than other-race faces, and shorter response times.In addition, at encoding, eye movements and pupillary responses to Asian faces(i.e., the other race) were different from those to Caucasian faces (i.e., theown race). Processing of own-race faces was characterized by more activescanning, with a larger number of shorter fixations, and more frequent saccades. Moreover, pupillary diameters were larger when viewing other-race than own-racefaces, suggesting a greater cognitive effort when encoding other-race faces.
 Early imaging studies in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) focused on the search formesial temporal sclerosis, as its surgical removal results in clinicallymeaningful improvement in about 70% of patients. Nevertheless, a considerablesubgroup of patients continues to suffer from post-operative seizures. Althoughthe reasons for surgical failure are not fully understood, electrophysiologicaland imaging data suggest that anomalies extending beyond the temporal lobe mayhave negative impact on outcome. This hypothesis has revived the concept of humanepilepsy as a disorder of distributed brain networks. Recent methodologicaladvances in non-invasive neuroimaging have led to quantify structural andfunctional networks in vivo. While structural networks can be inferred fromdiffusion MRI tractography and inter-regional covariance patterns of structuralmeasures such as cortical thickness, functional connectivity is generallycomputed based on statistical dependencies of neurophysiological time-series,measured through functional MRI or electroencephalographic techniques. Thisreview considers the application of advanced analytical methods in structural andfunctional connectivity analyses in TLE. We will specifically highlight findings from graph-theoretical analysis that allow assessing the topological organizationof brain networks. These studies have provided compelling evidence that TLE is a system disorder with profound alterations in local and distributed networks. Inaddition, there is emerging evidence for the utility of network properties asclinical diagnostic markers. Nowadays, a network perspective is considered to be essential to the understanding of the development, progression, and management ofepilepsy.
 Maladaptive decision-making is increasingly recognized to play a significant rolein numerous psychiatric disorders, such that therapeutics capable of amelioratingcore impairments in judgment may be beneficial in a range of patient populations.The field of "decision neuroscience" is therefore in its ascendancy, withresearchers from diverse fields bringing their expertise to bear on this complex and fascinating problem. In addition to the advances in neuroimaging andcomputational neuroscience that contribute enormously to this area, an increasein the complexity and sophistication of behavioral paradigms designed fornonhuman laboratory animals has also had a significant impact on researchers'ability to test the causal nature of hypotheses pertaining to the neuralcircuitry underlying the choice process. Multiple such decision-making assayshave been developed to investigate the neural and neurochemical bases ofdifferent types of cost/benefit decisions. However, what may seem like relativelytrivial variation in behavioral methodologies can actually result in recruitment of distinct cognitive mechanisms, and alter the neurobiological processes thatregulate choice. Here we focus on two areas of particular interest, namely,decisions that involve an assessment of uncertainty or effort, and compare someof the most prominent behavioral paradigms that have been used to investigatethese processes in laboratory rodents. We illustrate how an appreciation of thediversity in the nature of these tasks can lead to important insights into thecircumstances under which different neural regions make critical contributions todecision making.
 Empathy is key for healthy social functioning and individual differences inempathy have strong implications for manifold domains of social behavior. Empathycomprises of emotional and cognitive components and may also be closely linked tosensorimotor processes, which go along with the motivation and behavior torespond compassionately to another person's feelings. There is growing evidencefor local plastic change in the structure of the healthy adult human brain inresponse to environmental demands or intrinsic factors. Here we have investigatedchanges in brain structure resulting from or predisposing to empathy. Structural MRI data of 101 healthy adult females was analyzed. Empathy in fictitious as wellas real-life situations was assessed using a validated self-evaluation measure.Furthermore, empathy-related structural effects were also put into the context ofa functional map of the anterior insular cortex (AIC) determined by activationlikelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis of previous functional imaging studies.We found that gray matter (GM) density in the left dorsal AIC correlates withempathy and that this area overlaps with the domain general region (DGR) of theanterior insula that is situated in-between functional systems involved inemotion-cognition, pain, and motor tasks as determined by our meta-analysis.Thus, we propose that this insular region where we find structural differencesdepending on individual empathy may play a crucial role in modulating theefficiency of neural integration underlying emotional, cognitive, andsensorimotor information which is essential for global empathy.
 In the last decade, the phenomenon of empathy has received widespread attentionby the field of social neuroscience. This has provided fresh insights fortheoretical models of empathy, and substantially influenced the academic andpublic conceptions about this complex social skill. The present paper highlights three key issues which are often linked to empathy, but which at the same timemight obscure our understanding of it. These issues are: (1) shared neuralactivations and whether these can be interpreted as evidence for simulationaccounts of empathy; (2) the causal link of empathy to our presumed mirror neuronsystem; and (3) the question whether increasing empathy will result in bettermoral decisions and behaviors. The aim of our review is to provide the basis for critically evaluating our current understanding of empathy, and its publicreception, and to inspire new research directions.
 When people are confronted with social dilemmas, their decision-making strategiestend to be associated with individual social preferences; prosocials have anintrinsic willingness to cooperate, while proselfs need extrinsic motivatorssignaling personal gain. In this study, the biological roots for theproselfs/prosocials concept are explored by investigating the neural correlatesof cooperative versus defect decisions when participants engage in a series ofone-shot, anonymous prisoner's dilemma situations. Our data are in line withprevious studies showing that prosocials activate several social cognitionregions of the brain more than proselfs (here: medial prefrontal cortex,temporo-parietal junction, and precuneus BA 7 (Brodmann area 7), and thatdispositional trust positively affects prosocials' decisions to cooperate. At theneural level, however, dispositional trust appears to exert a greater marginaleffect on brain activity of proselfs in three social cognition regions, whichdoes not translate into an increase in cooperation. An event-related analysisshows that cooperating prosocials show significantly more activation in theprecuneus (BA 7) than proselfs. Based on previous research, we interpret thisresult to be consistent with prosocials' enhanced tendency to infer theintentions of others in social dilemma games, and the importance of establishing norm congruence when they decide to cooperate.
 Previous research suggests hypoactivity in response to the visual perception offaces in the fusiform gyri and amygdalae of individuals with autism. However,critical questions remain regarding the mechanisms underlying these findings. In particular, to what degree is the hypoactivation accounted for by knowndifferences in the visual scanpaths exhibited by individuals with and withoutautism in response to faces? Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging,we report "normalization" of activity in the right fusiform gyrus, but not theamygdalae, when individuals with autism were compelled to perform visualscanpaths that involved fixating on the eyes of a fearful face. These findingshold important implications for our understanding of social brain dysfunction in autism, theories of the role of the fusiform gyri in face processing, and thedesign of more effective interventions for autism.
 Previous research has investigated the association of personality traits withbrain activation in response to emotional stimuli. Our current research effortsare directed at understanding the temporal dynamics of networks of structuresassociated with particular personality traits, and gain insights into thefunctional contributions of more narrowly defined trait-facets that comprisethese personality traits. To begin this process, we conducted a functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study using an emotional attention task(emotional Stroop paradigm) and addressed the question whether individualdifferences in extraversion and its lower-level facets were associated withdifferences in activation, and in functional connectivity, of the anteriorcingulate (AC) cortex. We replicated our earlier finding that extraversion wasassociated with increased AC activation to positive, relative to neutral, wordstimuli, but now show that distinct facets of extraversion can account for thisassociation. When analyzing for functional connectivity, we found that greaterextraversion across individuals was associated with greater functionalconnectivity between the AC and the inferior parietal lobule, and that thisassociation could also be accounted for by distinct facets of extraversion. Ourdata suggest that extraversion and some of its lower-level facets are associated with individual differences across a network of structures believed to becritical in cognitive and affective processing.
 Abnormalities in both time processing and dopamine (DA) neurotransmission havebeen observed in schizophrenia. Time processing seems to be linked to DAneurotransmission. The cognitive dysmetria hypothesis postulates that psychosismight be a manifestation of the loss of coordination of mental processes due toimpaired timing. The objective of the present study was to analyze timingabilities and their corresponding functional neuroanatomy in schizophrenia. Weperformed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study using a predictivemotor timing paradigm in 28 schizophrenia patients and 27 matched healthycontrols (HC). The schizophrenia patients showed accelerated time processingcompared to HC; the amount of the acceleration positively correlated with thedegree of positive psychotic symptoms and negatively correlated withantipsychotic dose. This dysfunctional predictive timing was associated with BOLDsignal activity alterations in several brain networks, especially thosepreviously described as timing networks (basal ganglia, cerebellum, SMA, andinsula) and reward networks (hippocampus, amygdala, and NAcc). BOLD signalactivity in the cerebellar vermis was negatively associated with accelerated timeprocessing. Several lines of evidence suggest a direct link between DAtransmission and the cerebellar vermis that could explain their relevance for theneurobiology of schizophrenia.
 Pointing plays a central role in preverbal communication. While imperativepointing aims at influencing another person's behavior, declarative gesturesserve to convey epistemic information and to share interest in an object.Further, the latter are hypothesized to be a precursor ability of epistemiclanguage. So far, little is known about their underlying brain maturationprocesses. Therefore, the present study investigated the relation between brainmaturation processes and the production of imperative and declarative motives as well as epistemic language in N = 32 infants. EEG coherence scores were measured at 14 months, imperative and declarative point production at 15 months andepistemic language at 48 months. Results of correlational analyses suggestdistinct behavioral and neural patterns for imperative and declarative pointing, with declarative pointing being associated with the maturation of the lefthemisphere. Further, EEG coherence measures of the left hemisphere at 14 monthsand declarative pointing at 15 months are related to individual differences inepistemic language skills at 48 months, independently of child IQ. In regression analyses, coherence measures of the left hemisphere prove to be the mostimportant predictor of epistemic language skills. Thus, neural processes of theleft hemisphere seem particularly relevant to social communication.
 BACKGROUND: Since Berger's first EEG recordings in 1929, several techniques,initially developed for investigating periodic processes, have been applied tostudy non-periodic event-related brain state dynamics. NEW METHOD: We provide atheoretical comparison of the two approaches and present a new suite ofdata-driven analytic tools for the specific identification of the brainmicrostates in high-density event-related brain potentials (ERPs). This suiteincludes four different analytic methods. We validated this approach through aseries of theoretical simulations and an empirical investigation of a basicvisual paradigm, the reversal checkerboard task. RESULTS: Results indicate thatthe present suite of data-intensive analytic techniques, improves thespatiotemporal information one can garner about non-periodic brain microstatesfrom high-density electrical neuroimaging data. COMPARISON WITH EXISTINGMETHOD(S): Compared to the existing methods (such as those based on k-clustering methods), the current micro-segmentation approach offers several advantages,including the data-driven (automatic) detection of non-periodic quasi-stablebrain states. CONCLUSION: This suite of quantitative methods allows the automaticdetection of event-related changes in the global pattern of brain activity,putatively reflecting changes in the underlying neural locus for informationprocessing in the brain, and event-related changes in overall brain activation.In addition, within-subject and between-subject bootstrapping procedures provide a quantitative means of investigating how robust are the results of themicro-segmentation.
 Moving in a co-ordinated fashion with another individual changes our behaviourtowards them; we tend to like them more, find them more attractive, and are more willing to co-operate with them. It is generally assumed that this effect onbehaviour results from alterations in representations of self and others.Specifically, through neurophysiological perception-action matching mechanisms,interpersonal motor co-ordination (IMC) is believed to forge a neural couplingbetween actor and observer, which serves to blur boundaries in conceptualself-other representations and causes positive views of the self to be projected onto others. An investigation into this potential neural mechanism is lacking,however. Moreover, the specific components of IMC that might influence thismechanism have not yet been specified. In the present study we exploited a robustbehavioural phenomenon--automatic imitation--to assess the degree to which IMCinfluences neural action observation-execution matching mechanisms. This revealedthat automatic imitation is reduced when the actions of another individual areperceived to be synchronised in time, but are spatially incongruent, with ourown. We interpret our findings as evidence that IMC does indeed exert an effecton neural perception-action matching mechanisms, but this serves to promotebetter self-other distinction. Our findings demonstrate that furtherinvestigation is required to understand the complex relationship between neuralperception-action coupling, conceptual self-other representations, and socialbehaviour.
 In a contemporary setting in which all things "neuro" have great cultural sway,an analysis of the ways in which neuroscience is indebted to the methods andfindings of the social sciences has received less attention. Indeed, in the newspecialization of social neuroscience, neuroscientists now collaborate withcontemporary psychologists and invoke historical psychological theories to helptheorize empathy and social understanding. This article examines the overlapbetween psychological frameworks of social emotion and neuroscience in the caseof mirror neurons, discovered in the 1990s. Some neuroscientists purport thatmirror neurons underlie the social behaviours of imitation and empathy, and have found support for this view of theories of simulation and embodied cognition.They have also invoked pragmatic and phenomenological approaches to mind andbehaviour dating back to the early 20th century. Neuroscientists have thusimported, adapted, and interpreted psychological models to help define socialunderstanding, empathy, and imitation in many imaging studies.
 Opening and closing the eyes are fundamental behaviors for directing attention tothe external versus internal world. However, it remains unclear whether thestates of eyes-open (EO) relative to eyes-closed (EC) are associated withdifferent topological organizations of functional neural networks forexteroceptive and interoceptive processing (processing the external world andinternal state, respectively). Here, we used resting-state functional magneticresonance imaging and neural network analysis to investigate the topologicalproperties of functional networks of the human brain when the eyes were openversus closed. The brain networks exhibited higher cliquishness and localefficiency, but lower global efficiency during the EO state compared to the ECstate. These properties suggest an increase in specialized information processingalong with a decrease in integrated information processing in EO (vs. EC). Moreimportantly, the "exteroceptive" network, including the attentional system (e.g.,superior parietal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule), ocular motor system (e.g.,precentral gyrus and superior frontal gyrus), and arousal system (e.g., insulaand thalamus), showed higher regional nodal properties (nodal degree, efficiency and betweenness centrality) in EO relative to EC. In contrast, the"interoceptive" network, composed of visual system (e.g., lingual gyrus, fusiformgyrus and cuneus), auditory system (e.g., Heschl's gyurs), somatosensory system(e.g., postcentral gyrus), and part of the default mode network (e.g., angulargyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus), showed significantly higher regionalproperties in EC vs. EO. In addition, the connections across sensory modalitieswere altered by volitional eye opening. The synchronicity between the visualsystem and the motor, somatosensory and auditory systems, characteristic of EC,was attenuated in EO. Further, the connections between the visual system and the attention, arousal and subcortical systems were increased in EO. These resultsmay indicate that EO leads to a suppression of sensory modalities (other thanvisual) to allocate resources to exteroceptive processing. Our findings suggestthat the topological organization of human brain networks dynamically switchescorresponding to the information processing modes as we open or close our eyes.
 Certain groups (e.g., women, older adults, and the economically disadvantaged)are universally stigmatized. Numerous studies, however, have identifiedcross-cultural differences in the attitudes expressed toward stigmatized groups. These differences may potentially be due to existing cross-culturaldissimilarities in social status for some groups. The current study used fMRI to examine whether Chinese and Caucasian-American participants engage the samecognitive and affective mechanisms when perceiving stigmatized individuals withsimilarly low social status in both cultures (homeless individuals), butdifferent cognitive and/or affective processes when evaluating stigmatizedindividuals whose status differs across cultures (older adults). Using a socialneuroscience approach can provide unique insight into this question because theneural regions involved in cognitive and affective evaluations of stigmatizedindividuals have been well characterized. Results revealed that Chineseparticipants and Caucasian-American participants engaged similar patterns ofnegative affective processing associated with disgust (left anterior insula) whenevaluating homeless individuals. Moreover, self-reported negative explicitattitudes toward homeless individuals were associated with increased activity in the insula. However, Chinese participants and Caucasian-American participantsengaged increased activity in neural regions associated with status (ventralstriatum) when they evaluated older adults. Moreover, self-reported attitudestoward older adults and ventral striatal activity were correlated with the extentto which participants reported being affiliated with their respective culturaltraditions.
 Over the last couple of decades, most neuroscientific research on socialcognition has been dominated by a third-person paradigm in which participatingsubjects are not actively engaging with other agents but merely observe them.Recently this paradigm has been challenged by researchers who promote asecond-person approach to social cognition, and emphasize the importance ofdynamic, real-time interactions with others. The present article's contributionto this debate is twofold. First, we critically analyze the second-personchallenge to social neuroscience, and assess the various ways in which thedistinction between second- versus third-person modes of social cognition hasbeen articulated. Second, we put forward an alternative conceptualization of thisdistinction-one that gives pride of place to the notion of reciprocity. Wediscuss the implications of our proposal for neuroscientific studies on socialcognition.
 Social Neuroscience maintains that human survival depends on interpersonalrelations, and that shared circuits evolved to enhance our ability to interactwith and understand other people. Shared circuits operate by re-creating theOther's experience in the same brain regions used for Self experience. Theinterpersonal understanding made possible by shared circuits is, for the mostpart, outside conscious awareness and plays a role in the transference-countertransference interaction. The brain mechanisms of shared circuits are presentedand clinical vignettes illustrate the use of the concept of shared circuits inthe clinical setting.
 Research in social neuroscience provides increasing evidence that self and other are interconnected, both on a conceptual and on an affective representationallevel. Moreover, the ability to recognize the other as "like the self" is thoughtto be essential for social phenomena like empathy and compassion. Meditationpractices such as loving-kindness meditation (LKM) have been found to enhancethese capacities. Therefore, we investigated whether LKM is associated to anincreased integration of self-other-representations. As an indicator, we assessedthe P300 event-related potential elicited by oddball stimuli of the self-face anda close other's face in 12 long-term practitioners of LKM and 12 matchedcontrols. In line with previous studies, the self elicited larger P300 amplitudesthan close other. This effect was reduced in the meditation sample at parietalbut not frontal midline sites. Within this group, smaller differences betweenself- and other-related P300 were associated with increasing meditation practice.Across groups, smaller P300 differences correlated with self-reported compassion.In meditators, we also investigated the effect of a short LKM compared to acontrol priming procedure in order to test whether the state induction wouldadditionally modulate self- vs. other-related P300. However, no effect of thepriming conditions was observed. Overall, our findings provide preliminaryevidence that prolonged meditation practice may modulate self- vs. other-related processing, accompanied by an increase in compassion. Further evidence is needed,however, to show if this is a direct outcome of loving-kindness meditation.
 Understanding how the brain implements social behavior on one hand, and howsocial processes feedback on the brain to promote fine-tuning of behavioraloutput according to changes in the social environment is a major challenge incontemporary neuroscience. A critical step to take this challenge successfully isfinding the appropriate level of analysis when relating social to biologicalphenomena. Given the enormous complexity of both the neural networks of the brainand social systems, the use of a cognitive level of analysis (in an informationprocessing perspective) is proposed here as an explanatory interface betweenbrain and behavior. A conceptual framework for a cognitive approach tocomparative social neuroscience is proposed, consisting of the following steps tobe taken across different species with varying social systems: (1) identificationof the functional building blocks of social skills; (2) identification of thecognitive mechanisms underlying the previously identified social skills; and (3) mapping these information processing mechanisms onto the brain. Teleost fish are presented here as a group of choice to develop this approach, given the diversityof social systems present in closely related species that allows for plannedphylogenetic comparisons, and the availability of neurogenetic tools that allows the visualization and manipulation of selected neural circuits in model speciessuch as the zebrafish. Finally, the state-of-the art of zebrafish socialcognition and of the tools available to map social cognitive abilities to neural circuits in zebrafish are reviewed.
 Our goal was to test a model of sociopolitical attitudes that posits arelationship between individual differences in liberal versus conservativepolitical orientation and differential levels of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) responsivity. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) while participants who varied along a unidimensional liberal-conservative continuum engaged in astandard Go/NoGo task. We also measured component attitudes of politicalorientation in the form of traditionalism (degree of openness to social change)and egalitarianism (a preference for social equality). Generally, participantswho reported a more liberal political orientation made fewer errors and produced larger ACC-generated ERPs (the error-related negativity, or ERN and the NoGo N2).This ACC activation, especially as indicated by a larger NoGo N2, was moststrongly associated with greater preference for social equality. Performanceaccuracy, however, was most strongly associated with greater openness to socialchange. These data are consistent with a social neuroscience view thatsociopolitical attitudes are related to aspects of neurophysiologicalresponsivity. They also indicate that a bidimensional model of politicalorientation can enhance our interpretation of the nature of these associations.
 A growing consensus in social cognitive neuroscience holds that large portions ofthe primate visual brain are dedicated to the processing of social information,i.e., to those aspects of stimuli that are usually encountered in socialinteractions such as others' facial expressions, actions, and symbols. Yet,studies of social perception have mostly employed simple pictorialrepresentations of conspecifics. These stimuli are social only in the restricted sense that they physically resemble objects with which the observer wouldtypically interact. In an equally important sense, however, these stimuli mightbe regarded as "non-social": the observer knows that they are viewing picturesand might therefore not attribute current mental states to the stimuli or mightdo so in a qualitatively different way than in a real social interaction. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of such higher-order conceptualizationof the stimulus for social perceptual processing. Here, we assess the similarity between the various types of stimuli used in the laboratory and object classesencountered in real social interactions. We distinguish two different levels atwhich experimental stimuli can match social stimuli as encountered in everydaysocial settings: (1) the extent to which a stimulus' physical properties resemblethose typically encountered in social interactions and (2) the higher-levelconceptualization of the stimulus as indicating another person's mental states.We illustrate the significance of this distinction for social perception researchand report new empirical evidence further highlighting the importance of mentalstate attribution for perceptual processing. Finally, we discuss the potential ofthis approach to inform studies of clinical conditions such as autism.
 I present arguments against both explicit and implicit versions of the simulationtheory for intersubjective understanding. Logical, developmental, andphenomenological evidence counts against the concept of explicit simulation ifthis is to be understood as the pervasive or default way that we understandothers. The concept of implicit (subpersonal) simulation, identified with neural resonance systems (mirror systems or shared representations), fails to be thekind of simulation required by simulation theory, because it fails to explain howneuronal processes meet constraints that involve instrumentality and pretense.Implicit simulation theory also fails to explain how I can attribute a mental or emotion state that is different from my own to another person. I also provide abrief indication of an alternative interpretation of neural resonance systems.
 Social status hierarchy is a ubiquitous principle of social organization acrossthe animal kingdom. Recent findings in social neuroscience reveal distinct neuralnetworks associated with the recognition and experience of social hierarchy inhumans, as well as modulation of these networks by personality and culture.Additionally, allelic variation in the serotonin transporter gene is associatedwith prevalence of social hierarchy across species and cultures, suggesting theimportance of the study of genetic factors underlying social hierarchy. Futurestudies are needed to determine how genetic and environmental factors shapeneural systems involved in the production and maintenance of social hierarchyacross ontogeny and phylogeny.
 Previous investigations have shown that the perception of socially relevantfacial expressions, indicating someone else's intention to communicate (e.g.,smiling), correlate with increased activity in zygomaticus major muscleregardless of whether the facial expressions seen are directed towards the human observer or toward someone else (Mojzisch et al., 2006). These spontaneous,involuntary reactions have been described as facial mimicry and seem to be ofconsiderable importance for successful interpersonal communication. Weinvestigated whether specific neural substrates underlie these responses byperforming a finite impulse response (FIR) analysis of an experiment usingfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the perception ofsocially relevant facial expressions (Schilbach et al., 2006). This analysisdemonstrates that differential neural activity can be detected relative to theFIR time window in which facial mimicry occurs. The neural network found includesbut extends beyond classical motor regions (face motor area) recruiting brainregions known to be involved in social cognition. This network is proposed tosubserve the integration of emotional and action-related processes as part of apre-reflective, embodied reaction to the perception of socially relevant facialexpressions as well as a reflective representation of self and other.
 Insults always sting, but the context in which they are delivered can make theeffects even worse. Here we test how the brain processes insults, and whether andhow the neurocognitive processing of insults is changed by the presence of alaughing crowd. Event-related potentials showed that insults, compared tocompliments, evoked an increase in N400 amplitude (indicating increasedlexical-semantic processing) and LPP amplitude (indicating emotional processing) when presented in isolation. When insults were perceived in the presence of alaughing crowd, the difference in N400 amplitude disappeared, while thedifference in LPP activation increased. These results show that even withoutlaughter, verbal insults receive additional neural processing over compliments,both at the lexical-semantic and emotional level. The presence of a laughingcrowd has a direct effect on the neurocognitive processing of insults, leading tostronger and more elongated emotional processing.
 In the present study we investigated the nature and chronometry of empathy forpain influences on perceptual and motor processes. Thus, event-related brainpotentials (ERPs), response force (RF) and oscillatory electroencephalography(EEG) activity were measured while participants were presented with pictures ofbody parts in painful or neutral situations. Their task consisted in eitherjudging the painfulness of the stimuli or counting the body parts displayed. ERP results supported the assumption of an early automatic component of empathy forpain, as reflected by the early posterior negativity (EPN), and of a latecontrolled component, as reflected by the late posterior positivity (P3). RFindicated that empathy-evoking stimuli facilitate motor responses if attention isdirected toward the pain dimension, whereas EEG oscillations in the mu-andbeta-band revealed, independent of the task, an enhanced activation of thesensorimotor cortex after the response to painful compared to neutral stimuli. Inconclusion, present findings indicate that empathy-evoking stimuli produceautomatic and controlled effects on both perceptual and motor processing.
 Parental availability influences fear expression and learning across species, butthe effect of maternal buffering on fear learning in humans is unknown. Here weinvestigated the effect of maternal availability during fear conditioning in agroup of children (ages 8-10) and adolescents (ages 11-13) from a low-incomepopulation with a range of trauma exposure. Acoustic startle response data werecollected to measure fear-potentiated startle (FPS) in 104 participants. A total of 62 participants were tested with the mother available and 42 when the motherwas not in the testing room. We observed that maternal availability during fearconditioning interacted with age to affect FPS discrimination between CS+ andCS-. In line with previous findings suggesting an absence of maternal bufferingin adolescents, fear discrimination was affected by maternal availability only inchildren. Second, we observed that the effect of maternal buffering on FPSdiscrimination in children was not influenced by maternally reported warmth. Inconclusion, we demonstrated that maternal availability improved discrimination inchildren, regardless of the quality of the relationship. Adolescentsdiscriminated irrespective of maternal status, suggesting that childhood may be asensitive period for environmental influences on key processes such as learningof danger and safety signals.
 Intranasal (IN) administration is a widely used method for examining the effectof oxytocin (OT) on social behavior and cognition in healthy subjects andpsychiatric populations. IN-OT in humans enhances trust, emotional perception,and empathetic behavior and is under investigation as a potential pharmacotherapyto enhance social functioning in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders,including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Nonhuman primates (NHP) are animportant model for understanding the effect of OT on social cognition, itsneural mechanisms, and the development of IN-OT as a pharmacotherapy for treatingsocial deficits in humans. However, NHP and even some human populations, such as very young infants and children, cannot easily follow the detailedself-administration protocol used in the majority of human IN-OT studies.Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of several OT-administration routes forelevating central OT concentrations in rhesus macaques. First, we examined theeffect of IN and intravenous (IV) routes of OT administration on concentrationsof OT and vasopressin (AVP) in plasma and lumbar CSF. Second, we examined thesesame measures in monkeys after an aerosolized (AE) OT delivery route. All threeadministration routes significantly increased plasma OT concentrations, but only the AE-OT route significantly increased concentrations of CSF OT. No routeaffected concentrations of AVP in plasma or CSF. This study confirms that the AE route is the most effective method for increasing central OT concentrations inmonkeys, and may also be an effective route, alternative to IN, for administeringOT to some human populations.
 One important aspect of metacognition is the ability to accurately evaluate one'sperformance. People vary widely in their metacognitive ability and in general aretoo confident when evaluating their performance. This often leads to poordecision making with potentially disastrous consequences. To further ourunderstanding of the neural underpinnings of these processes, this fMRI studyinvestigated inter-individual differences in metacognitive ability and effects oftrial-by-trial variation in subjective feelings of confidence when makingmetacognitive assessments. Participants (N = 308) evaluated their performance in a high-level social and cognitive reasoning task. The results showed that higher metacognitive accuracy was associated with a decrease in activation in theanterior medial prefrontal cortex, an area previously linked to metacognition on perception and memory. Moreover, the feeling of confidence about one's choiceswas associated with an increase of activation in reward, memory and motor relatedareas including bilateral striatum and hippocampus, while less confidence wasassociated with activation in areas linked with negative affect and uncertainty, including dorsomedial prefrontal and bilateral orbitofrontal cortex. This mightindicate that positive affect is related to higher confidence thereby biasingmetacognitive decisions towards overconfidence. In support, behavioural analyses revealed that increased confidence was associated with lower metacognitiveaccuracy.
 Despite the well-documented importance of paternal caregiving for positive child development, little is known about the neural changes that accompany thetransition to fatherhood in humans, or about how changes in hormone levels affectpaternal brain function. We compared fathers of children aged 1-2 withnon-fathers in terms of hormone levels (oxytocin and testosterone), neuralresponses to child picture stimuli, and neural responses to visual sexualstimuli. Compared to non-fathers, fathers had significantly higher levels ofplasma oxytocin and lower levels of plasma testosterone. In response to childpicture stimuli, fathers showed stronger activation than non-fathers withinregions important for face emotion processing (caudal middle frontal gyrus[MFG]), mentalizing (temporo-parietal junction [TPJ]) and reward processing(medial orbitofrontal cortex [mOFC]). On the other hand, non-fathers hadsignificantly stronger neural responses to sexually provocative images in regionsimportant for reward and approach-related motivation (dorsal caudate and nucleus accumbens). Testosterone levels were negatively correlated with responses tochild stimuli in the MFG. Surprisingly, neither testosterone nor oxytocin levels predicted neural responses to sexual stimuli. Our results suggest that thedecline in testosterone that accompanies the transition to fatherhood may beimportant for augmenting empathy toward children.
 Reciprocation of trust exchanges is central to the development of interpersonalrelationships and societal well-being. Understanding how humans make pro-socialand self-centered decisions in dyadic interactions and how to predict thesechoices has been an area of great interest in social neuroscience. A functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based technology with potential clinicalapplication is the study of resting state brain connectivity. We tested ifresting state connectivity may predict choice behavior in a social context.Twenty-nine healthy adults underwent resting state fMRI before performing theTrust Game, a two person monetary exchange game. We assessed the ability ofpatterns of resting-state functional brain organization, demographiccharacteristics and a measure of moral development, the Defining Issues Test(DIT-2), to predict individuals' decisions to reciprocate money during the Trust Game. Subjects reciprocated in 74.9% of the trials. Independent componentanalysis identified canonical resting-state networks. Increased functionalconnectivity between the salience (bilateral insula/anterior cingulate) andcentral executive (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex/ posterior parietal cortex)networks significantly predicted the choice to reciprocate pro-social behavior(R(2) = 0.20, p = 0.015). Stepwise linear regression analysis showed thatfunctional connectivity between these two networks (p = 0.002), age (p = 0.007)and DIT-2 personal interest schema score (p = 0.032) significantly predictedreciprocity behavior (R(2) = 0.498, p = 0.001). Intrinsic functional connectivitybetween neural networks in conjunction with other individual characteristics may be a valuable tool for predicting performance during social interactions. Future replication and temporal extension of these findings may bolster theunderstanding of decision making in clinical, financial and marketing settings.
 Although kindness-based contemplative practices are increasingly employed byclinicians and cognitive researchers to enhance prosocial emotions, socialcognitive skills, and well-being, and as a tool to understand the basic workings of the social mind, we lack a coherent theoretical model with which to test themechanisms by which kindness-based meditation may alter the brain and body. Here,we link contemplative accounts of compassion and loving-kindness practices withresearch from social cognitive neuroscience and social psychology to generatepredictions about how diverse practices may alter brain structure and functionand related aspects of social cognition. Contingent on the nuances of thepractice, kindness-based meditation may enhance the neural systems related tofaster and more basic perceptual or motor simulation processes, simulation ofanother's affective body state, slower and higher-level perspective-taking,modulatory processes such as emotion regulation and self/other discrimination,and combinations thereof. This theoretical model will be discussed alongside bestpractices for testing such a model and potential implications and applications offuture work.
 Human social intelligence depends on a diverse array of perceptual, cognitive,and motivational capacities. Some of these capacities depend on neural systemsthat may have evolved through modification of ancestral systems with non-socialor more limited social functions (evolutionary repurposing). Social intelligence,in turn, enables new forms of repurposing within the lifetime of an individual(cultural and instrumental repurposing), which entail innovating over andexploiting pre-existing circuitry to meet problems our brains did not evolve tosolve. Considering these repurposing processes can provide insight into thecomputations that brain regions contribute to social information processing,generate testable predictions that usefully constrain social neuroscience theory,and reveal biologically imposed constraints on cultural inventions and ourability to respond beneficially to contemporary challenges.
 Psychophysiological research on empathy and prosociality in children has focused most often on cardiac activity, heart rate (HR), and HR deceleration inparticular. We examined these processes in 7-year-old children during two empathymood inductions. We independently assessed children's responses to others'distress in two different contexts: structured probes (simulated pain) andmaternal interviews. We identified three groups of children who showed either (1)concern for others in distress (i.e., empathy and prosocial behaviors), (2)active disregard (i.e., anger/hostility and antisocial behavior), or (3) passive disregard (i.e., little or no concern). We compared groups on HR and HRdeceleration. The active disregard group consistently showed the lowest HR bothwhen groups were based on structured probes and on mothers' reports. Children whoshowed passive disregard displayed little self-distress during other's distressand different patterns of association of self-distress and HR than the other two groups. Active and passive disregard thus may reflect two different aspects oflack of concern for others. HR deceleration was seen for all three groups,suggesting it is not necessarily a cardiac index of concern for others.Interdisciplinary approaches and multiple-systems analysis are needed to betterunderstand psychobiological substrates.
 BACKGROUND: Difficulties with the regulation of negative affect have beenextensively studied in neuroimaging research. However, dysregulation of aspecific emotion, disgust, has hardly been investigated. In the present study, weused voxel-based morphometry to identify whether gray matter volume (GMV) offrontal regions is correlated with personality traits associated with general anddisgust-specific emotion regulation difficulties. METHOD: We analyzed T1-weightedimages of 49 females (mean age = 22.8 years, SD = 3.2). The women rated theirdisgust sensitivity (DS) (temporally stable tendency to experience disgust asuncontrollable and extremely aversive) as well as general difficulties withemotion regulation. RESULTS: DS and general emotion regulation deficits werepositively associated with a heightened GMV of the orbitofrontal cortex. DSadditionally showed a negative association with GMV of the medial prefrontalcortex. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed shared and distinct contributions of frontal brain regions to disgust-specific and general emotion regulationdifficulties.
 Researchers from multiple fields have sought to understand how sex moderateshuman social behavior. While over 50 years of research has revealed differencesin cooperation behavior of males and females, the underlying neural correlates ofthese sex differences have not been explained. A missing and fundamental element of this puzzle is an understanding of how the sex composition of an interactingdyad influences the brain and behavior during cooperation. Using fNIRS-basedhyperscanning in 111 same- and mixed-sex dyads, we identified significantbehavioral and neural sex-related differences in association with acomputer-based cooperation task. Dyads containing at least one male demonstrated significantly higher behavioral performance than female/female dyads. Individual males and females showed significant activation in the right frontopolar andright inferior prefrontal cortices, although this activation was greater infemales compared to males. Female/female dyad's exhibited significant inter-braincoherence within the right temporal cortex, while significant coherence inmale/male dyads occurred in the right inferior prefrontal cortex. Significantcoherence was not observed in mixed-sex dyads. Finally, for same-sex dyads only, task-related inter-brain coherence was positively correlated with cooperationtask performance. Our results highlight multiple important and previouslyundetected influences of sex on concurrent neural and behavioral signatures ofcooperation.
 Being touched by another person influences our readiness to empathize with andsupport that person. We asked whether this influence arises from somatosensoryexperience, the proximity to the person and/or an attribution of thesomatosensory experience to the person. Moreover, we were interested in whetherand how touch affects the processing of ensuing events. To this end, we presentedneutral and negative pictures with or without gentle pressure to theparticipants' forearm. In Experiment 1, pressure was applied by a friend, appliedby a tactile device and attributed to the friend, or applied by a tactile device and attributed to a computer. Across these conditions, touch enhancedevent-related potential (ERP) correlates of picture processing. Pictures eliciteda larger posterior N100 and a late positivity discriminated more strongly betweenpictures of neutral and negative content when participants were touched.Experiment 2 replicated these findings while controlling for the predictivequality of touch. Experiment 3 replaced tactile contact with a tone, which failedto enhance N100 amplitude and emotion discrimination reflected by the latepositivity. This indicates that touch sensitizes ongoing cognitive and emotional processes and that this sensitization is mediated by bottom-up somatosensoryprocessing. Moreover, touch seems to be a special sensory signal that influences recipients in the absence of conscious reflection and that promotes prosocialbehavior.
 OBJECTIVES: While prejudice has often been shown to be rooted in experiences ofthreat, the biological underpinnings of this threat-prejudice association havereceived less research attention. The present experiment aims to test whetheractivations of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, due to anticipated interactions with out-group members, predict self-reported prejudice. Moreover,we explore potential moderators of this relationship (i.e., interpersonalsimilarity; subtle vs. blatant prejudice). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Participants anticipated an interaction with an out-group member who was similar or dissimilar to the self. To index HPA activation, cortisol responses to thisevent were measured. Then, subtle and blatant prejudices were measured viaquestionnaires. Findings indicated that only when people anticipated aninteraction with an out-group member who was dissimilar to the self, theircortisol response to this event significantly predicted subtle (r = .50) andblatant (r = .53) prejudice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate thatprejudicial attitudes are linked to HPA-axis activity. Furthermore, whenintergroup interactions are interpreted to be about individuals (and not so much about groups), experienced threat (or its biological substrate) is less likely torelate to prejudice. This conclusion is discussed in terms of recent insightsfrom social neuroscience.
 Face recognition is a complex skill that requires the integration of facialfeatures across the whole face, e.g., holistic processing. It is unclear whether,and to what extent, other species process faces in a manner that is similar tohumans. Previous studies on the inversion effect, a marker of holisticprocessing, in nonhuman primates have revealed mixed results in part because manystudies have failed to include alternative image categories necessary tounderstand whether the effects are truly face-specific. The present studyre-examined the inversion effect in rhesus monkeys and chimpanzees usingcomparable testing methods and a variety of high quality stimuli including faces and nonfaces. The data support an inversion effect in chimpanzees only forconspecifics' faces (expert category), suggesting face-specific holisticprocessing similar to humans. Rhesus monkeys showed inversion effects forconspecifics, but also for heterospecifics' faces (chimpanzees), and nonfacesimages (houses), supporting important species differences in this simple test of holistic face processing.
 While the right-hemispheric lateralization of the face perception network is wellestablished, recent evidence suggests that handedness affects the cerebrallateralization of face processing at the hierarchical level of the fusiform face area (FFA). However, the neural mechanisms underlying differential hemisphericlateralization of face perception in right- and left-handers are largely unknown.Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) for fMRI, we aimed to unravel the putativeprocesses that mediate handedness-related differences by investigating theeffective connectivity in the bilateral core face perception network. Our resultsreveal an enhanced recruitment of the left FFA in left-handers compared toright-handers, as evidenced by more pronounced face-specific modulatoryinfluences on both intra- and interhemispheric connections. As structural andphysiological correlates of handedness-related differences in face processing,right- and left-handers varied with regard to their gray matter volume in theleft fusiform gyrus and their pupil responses to face stimuli. Overall, theseresults describe how handedness is related to the lateralization of the core faceperception network, and point to different neural mechanisms underlying faceprocessing in right- and left-handers. In a wider context, this demonstrates the entanglement of structurally and functionally remote brain networks, suggesting abroader underlying process regulating brain lateralization.
 Self-esteem affects human life. A thorough examination of the cognitive processesand neural activations of implicit self-evaluation should aid our understandingof self-esteem. The current study examined electrophysiological correlates ofimplicit self-evaluation among 19 healthy participants using event-relatedpotentials (ERPs) recorded during an Implicit Association Test (IAT). Behavioral results showed that participants responded faster in the compatible condition(compared to the incompatible condition) in which "self" was paired with"positive" traits and "others" was paired with "negative" traits, reflectingpositive nature of implicit self-evaluation. ERP results showed that theincompatible condition elicited a larger N200 and a smaller P3 compared to thecompatible condition. These findings indicated that both executive control andstimulus categorization were involved in implicit self-evaluation, reflected byN200 and P3, respectively. We accordingly suggested that implicit self-evaluationmanifests in multiple cognitive processes.
 Neuromodulators such as serotonin, oxytocin and testosterone play an importantrole in social behavior. Studies examining the effects of these neuromodulatorsand others on social cognition and behavior (and their neural underpinnings) are becoming increasingly common. Here, we provide an overview of methodologicalconsiderations for those wishing to evaluate or conduct empirical studies ofneuromodulation in social neuroscience.
 In adapting our behavior to a rapidly changing environment, we also tune ourbehavior to that of others. To investigate the neural bases of such adaptivemechanisms, we examined how individuals adjust their actions afterdecision-conflicts observed in others compared to self-experienced conflicts.Participants responded to the color of a stimulus, while its spatial positionelicited either a conflicting or a congruent action. Participants were requiredeither to respond to stimuli themselves or to observe the response of anotherparticipant. We studied the difference between interference effects followingconflicting or congruent stimuli, an effect known as conflict adaptation.Consistent with earlier reports, we found that the implementation of reactivecontrol, following congruent trials, was accompanied by activation of the rightinferior frontal cortex. Individual differences in the efficacy of responseinhibition covaried with the level of activation in that region. Sustainingproactive control, following incongruent trials, activated the left lateralprefrontal cortex. Most importantly, adaptive controls induced bydecision-conflicts observed in others, as well as the associated prefrontalactivations, were comparable to those induced by self-experienced conflicts. Weshow that in both behavioral and neural terms we adapt to conflicts happening to others just as if they happened to us.
 Intertemporal choice involves the processes of valuation and choice. Choice isoften the result of subjective valuation, in which reward is integrated with timedelay. Here, using event-related potential (ERP) signals as temporal hallmarks,we aim to investigate temporal dynamics of how reward interacts with time delayduring a delayed discounting task. We found that participants preferred immediaterewards when delayed rewards were small or over long-term delays. Our ERP resultssuggested that the P200 component reflected an initial valuation of reward andtime delay, while the frontal N2 component correlated with individual choices of immediate option of rewards. The LPP component was modulated by the N2 component.These findings demonstrate that the N2 component is the key component in temporaldynamics of the interaction between reward and time valuation.
 Social interaction involves the active visual perception of facial expressionsand communicative gestures. This study examines the distribution of gazefixations while watching videos of expressive talking faces. The knowledge-drivenfactors that influence the selective visual processing of facial information wereexamined by using the same set of stimuli, and assigning subjects to either aspeech recognition task or an emotion judgment task. For half of the subjectsassigned to each of the tasks, the intelligibility of the speech was manipulated by the addition of moderate masking noise. Both tasks and the intelligibility of the speech signal influenced the spatial distribution of gaze. Gaze wasconcentrated more on the eyes when emotion was being judged as compared to whenwords were being identified. When noise was added to the acoustic signal, gaze inboth tasks was more centralized on the face. This shows that subject's gaze issensitive to the distribution of information on the face, but can also beinfluenced by strategies aimed at maximizing the amount of visual informationprocessed.
 The experience of current outcomes influences future decisions in various ways.The neural mechanism of this phenomenon may help to clarify the determinants ofdecision-making. In this study, thirty-nine young adults finished a riskygambling task by choosing between a high- and a low-risk option in each trialduring electroencephalographic data collection. We found that risk-takingstrategies significantly modulated mean amplitudes of the event-related potential(ERP) component P3, particularly at the central scalp. The event-related spectralperturbation and the inter-trial coherence measurements of the independentcomponent analysis (ICA) data indicated that the "stay" vs. "switch"electrophysiological difference associated with subsequent decision-making wasmainly due to fronto-central theta and left/right mu independent components.Event-related cross-coherence results suggested that the neural information ofaction monitoring and updating emerged in the fronto-central cortex andpropagated to sensorimotor area for further behavior adjustment. Based on thesefindings of ERP and event-related oscillation (ERO) measures, we propose a neuralmodel of the influence of current outcomes on future decisions.
 In order to interpret and engage with the social world, individuals mustunderstand how they relate to others. Self-other understanding forms the backboneof social cognition and is a central concept explored by research into basicprocesses such as action perception and empathy, as well as research on moresophisticated social behaviours such as cooperation and intergroup interaction.This theme issue integrates the latest research into self-other understandingfrom evolutionary biology, anthropology, psychology, neuroscience and psychiatry.By gathering perspectives from a diverse range of disciplines, the contributions showcase ways in which research in these areas both informs and is informed byapproaches spanning the biological and social sciences, thus deepening ourunderstanding of how we relate to others in a social world.
 Despite the fact that nonverbal dyadic social interactions are abundant in theenvironment, the neural mechanisms underlying their processing are not yet fully understood. Research in the field of social neuroscience has suggested that twoneural networks appear to be involved in social understanding: (1) the actionobservation network (AON) and (2) the social neural network (SNN). The aim ofthis study was to determine the differential contributions of the AON and the SNNto the processing of nonverbal behavior as observed in dyadic socialinteractions. To this end, we used short computer animation sequences displaying dyadic social interactions between two virtual characters and systematicallymanipulated two key features of movement activity, which are known to influencethe perception of meaning in nonverbal stimuli: (1) movement fluency and (2)contingency of movement patterns. A group of 21 male participants rated the"naturalness" of the observed scenes on a four-point scale while undergoing fMRI.Behavioral results showed that both fluency and contingency significantlyinfluenced the "naturalness" experience of the presented animations. Neurally,the AON was preferentially engaged when processing contingent movement patterns, but did not discriminate between different degrees of movement fluency. Incontrast, regions of the SNN were engaged more strongly when observing dyads withdisturbed movement fluency. In conclusion, while the AON is involved in thegeneral processing of contingent social actions, irrespective of their kinematic properties, the SNN is preferentially recruited when atypical kinematicproperties prompt inferences about the agents' intentions.
 We examined how penalized linear discriminant analysis with resampling, which is a supervised, multivariate, whole-brain reduction technique, can helpschizophrenia diagnostics and research. In an experiment with magnetic resonance brain images of 52 first-episode schizophrenia patients and 52 healthy controls, this method allowed us to select brain areas relevant to schizophrenia, such asthe left prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulum, the right anterior insula, thethalamus, and the hippocampus. Nevertheless, the classification performance basedon such reduced data was not significantly better than the classification of datareduced by mass univariate selection using a t-test or unsupervised multivariate reduction using principal component analysis. Moreover, we found no importantinfluence of the type of imaging features, namely local deformations or graymatter volumes, and the classification method, specifically linear discriminantanalysis or linear support vector machines, on the classification results.However, we ascertained significant effect of a cross-validation setting onclassification performance as classification results were overestimated eventhough the resampling was performed during the selection of brain imagingfeatures. Therefore, it is critically important to perform cross-validation inall steps of the analysis (not only during classification) in case there is noexternal validation set to avoid optimistically biasing the results ofclassification studies.
 The methods of cognitive neuroscience are beginning to be applied to the study ofpolitical behavior. The neural substrates of value-based decision-making havebeen extensively examined in economic contexts; this might provide a powerfulstarting point for understanding political decision-making. Here, we asked towhat extent the neuropolitics literature to date has used conceptual frameworksand experimental designs that make contact with the reward-related approachesthat have dominated decision neuroscience. We then asked whether the studies ofpolitical behavior that can be considered in this light implicate the brainregions that have been associated with subjective value related to "economic"reward. We performed a systematic literature review to identify papers addressingthe neural substrates of political behavior and extracted the fMRI studiesreporting behavioral measures of subjective value as defined in decisionneuroscience studies of reward. A minority of neuropolitics studies met thesecriteria and relatively few brain activation foci from these studies overlappedwith regions where activity has been related to subjective value. These findings show modest influence of reward-focused decision neuroscience on neuropoliticsresearch to date. Whether the neural substrates of subjective value identified ineconomic choice paradigms generalize to political choice thus remains an openquestion. We argue that systematically addressing the commonalities anddifferences in these two classes of value-based choice will be important indeveloping a more comprehensive model of the brain basis of humandecision-making.
 The processing of infant faces may be somewhat distinct from that of adult faces.Indeed, recent neuroimaging studies have provided evidence of an early,"baby-specific" neural response whereby infant faces are perceived more rapidlythan adult faces. Using event-related potentials, the present study aimed todetermine whether the preferential response to infant faces is present at bothearly and late stages of face processing, and to investigate the effects ofesthetic appearance on the processing of adult and infant faces by directlymanipulating the perceived attractiveness or cuteness within a given faceidentity. Here, we find evidence for enhanced processing of infant faces,relative to adult faces, at both early (N170, P2) and late (LPC) stages of faceprocessing. We also find that the esthetic appearance of both infant and adultfaces modulates early neural responses, with enhanced responses to lessattractive/cute faces as compared to more attractive/cute faces. Overall, ourresults provide additional evidence for a preferential response to infant facesat early stages of processing, and provide new evidence that this preferentialresponse occurs at later stages of face processing as well, independent of theesthetic quality of the face or observer sex.
 Social relationships endow health and fitness benefits, but considerablevariation exists in the extent to which individuals form and maintain salutarysocial relationships. The mental and physical health effects of social bonds are more strongly related to perceived isolation (loneliness) than to objectivesocial network characteristics. We sought to develop an animal model tofacilitate the experimental analysis of the development of, and the behavioraland biological consequences of, loneliness. In Study 1, using a population-based sample of older adults, we examined how loneliness was influenced both by social network size and by the extent to which individuals believed that their dailysocial interactions reflected their own choice. Results revealed three distinctclusters of individuals: (i) individuals with large networks who believed theyhad high choice were lowest in loneliness, (ii) individuals with small socialnetworks who believed they had low choice were highest in loneliness, and (iii)the remaining two groups were intermediate and equivalent in loneliness. In Study2, a similar three-group structure was identified in two separate samples ofadult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) living in large social groups: (i)those high in sociability who had complex social interaction with a broad rangeof social partners (putatively low in loneliness), (ii) those low in sociability who showed tentative interactions with certain classes of social partners(putatively high in loneliness), and (iii) those low in sociability whointeracted overall at low levels with a broad range of social partners(putatively low or intermediate in loneliness). This taxonomy in monkeys wasvalidated in subsequent experimental social probe studies. These results suggest that, in highly social nonhuman primate species, some animals may show a mismatchbetween social interest and social attainment that could serve as a useful animalmodel for experimental and mechanistic studies of loneliness.
 Processes through which parental ideology is transmitted to children-especiallyat a young age prior to the formation of political beliefs-remain poorlyunderstood. Given recent evidence that political ideology is associated withneural responses to cognitive conflict in adults, we tested the exploratoryhypothesis that children's neurocognitive responses to conflict may also differdepending on their parents' ideology. We assessed relations between parentalpolitical ideology and children's neurocognitive responses to conflict, asmeasured by the N2 component of the event-related potential. Children aged 5-7completed an age-appropriate flanker task while electroencephalography wasrecorded, and the N2 was scored to incongruent versus congruent flankers to indexconflict processing. Because previous research documents heightenedliberal-conservative differences in threat-relevant contexts, each trial of thetask was preceded by an angry face (threat-relevant) or comparison face (happy orneutral). An effect of parental ideology on the conflict-related N2 emerged inthe threat condition, such that the N2 was larger among children of liberalscompared with children of moderates and conservatives. These findings suggestthat individual differences in neurocognitive responses to conflict, heightenedin the context of threat, may reflect a more general pattern of individualdifferences that, in adults, relates to political ideology.
 Motivational interdependence is an organizing principle in Schwartz's circumplex model of social values, which has received abundant cross-cultural support. Weused fMRI to test whether motivational relations between social values predictdifferent brain responses in a situation of choice between values. Wehypothesized that differences in brain responses would become evident when themore important value had to be selected in pairs of congruent (e.g., wealth andsuccess) as opposed to incongruent (e.g., curiosity and stability) values as theyare described in Schwartz's model, because the former serve mutually facilitatingmotives, whereas the latter serve mutually inhibiting motives. Consistent withthe model, choosing between congruent values led to longer response times andmore activation in conflict-related brain regions (e.g., the supplementary motor area, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) than selecting between incongruent values. These results provide novel neural evidence supporting the circumplex model'spredictions about motivational interdependence between social values. Inparticular, our results show that the neural networks underlying social valuesare organized in a way that allows activation patterns related to motivationalsimilarity between congruent values to be dissociated from those related toincongruent values.
 Social species, by definition, form organizations that extend beyond theindividual. These structures evolved hand in hand with behavioral, neural,hormonal, cellular, and genetic mechanisms to support them because the consequentsocial behaviors helped these organisms survive, reproduce, and care foroffspring sufficiently long that they too reproduced. Social isolation representsa lens through which to investigate these behavioral, neural, hormonal, cellular,and genetic mechanisms. Evidence from human and nonhuman animal studies indicatesthat isolation heightens sensitivity to social threats (predator evasion) andmotivates the renewal of social connections. The effects of perceived isolationin humans share much in common with the effects of experimental manipulations of isolation in nonhuman social species: increased tonic sympathetic tonus and HPAactivation; and decreased inflammatory control, immunity, sleep salubrity, andexpression of genes regulating glucocorticoid responses. Together, these effects contribute to higher rates of morbidity and mortality in older adults.
 Empathy is generally thought of as the ability to share the emotional experiencesof others. In scientific terms, this is usually operationalized as an ability to vicariously feel others' mental and emotional experiences. Supporting thisaccount, research demonstrates that watching others experience physical painactivates similar brain regions to the actual experience of pain itself.First-hand experience of social rejection also activates this network. Thecurrent work extends these findings by examining whether the "pain" network issimilarly implicated in witnessing rejection, and whether emotional closenessmodulates this response. We provide evidence for each of these suppositions,demonstrating: (a) that the pain network is activated when watching a friendsuffer social rejection, and (b) that interpersonal closeness with that friendmodulates this response. Further, we found that the inferior frontal gyrus,critical for representing others' mental and emotional states, mediates therelationship between emotional closeness and neural responses to watching therejection of a friend.
 Since its development around 1800 psychiatry has been oscillating between thepoles of the sciences and the humanities, being directed towards subjectiveexperience on the one hand and towards the neural substrate on the other hand.Today, this dualism seems to have been overcome by a naturalism, which identifiessubjective experience with neural processes, according to Griesinger's frequentlyquoted statement "mental diseases are brain diseases". The progress achieved bythe neurobiological paradigm on the level of a fundamental science is in contrastto the tendency to isolate mental illnesses from the patients' socialrelationships and to neglect subjectivity and intersubjectivity in theirexplanation. What should be searched for is therefore an overarching paradigmthat is able to establish psychiatry as a relational medicine in an encompassing sense: as a science and practice of biological, psychological and socialrelationships and their disorders. Within such a paradigm, the brain may beunderstood and investigated as the central "relational organ" withoutreductionist constrictions.
 One of teenagers' key developmental tasks is to engage in new and meaningfulrelationships with peers and adults outside the family context.Attachment-derived expectations about the self and others in terms of internalattachment working models have the potential to shape such social reorientationprocesses critically and thereby influence adolescents' social-emotionaldevelopment and social integration. Because the neural underpinnings of thisdevelopmental task remain largely unknown, we sought to investigate them byfunctional magnetic resonance imaging. We asked n = 44 adolescents (ages12.01-18.84 years) to evaluate positive and negative adjectives regarding either themselves or a close other during an adapted version of the well-establishedself-other trait-evaluation task. As measures of attachment, we obtained scoresreflecting participants' positive versus negative attachment-derived self- andother-models by means of the Relationship Questionnaire. We controlled forpossible confounding factors by also obtaining scores reflectinginternalizing/externalizing problems, schizotypy, and borderline symptomatology. Our results revealed that participants with a more negative attachment-derivedself-model showed increased brain activity during positive and negative adjectiveevaluation regarding the self, but decreased brain activity during negativeadjective evaluation regarding a close other, in bilateralamygdala/parahippocampus, bilateral anterior temporal pole/anterior superiortemporal gyrus, and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings suggestthat a low positivity of the self-concept characteristic for the attachmentanxiety dimension may influence neural information processing, but in oppositedirections when it comes to self- versus (close) other-representations. Wediscuss our results in the framework of attachment theory and regarding theirimplications especially for adolescent social-emotional development and socialintegration.
 Social cognitive neuroscience is a recent interdisciplinary field that studiesthe neural basis of the social mind. Event-related potentials (ERPs) provideprecise information about the time dynamics of the brain. In this study, weassess the role of ERPs in cognitive neuroscience, particularly in the emergingarea of social neuroscience. First, we briefly introduce the technique of ERPs.Subsequently, we describe several ERP components (P1, N1, N170, vertex positivepotential, early posterior negativity, N2, P2, P3, N400, N400-like, late positivecomplex, late positive potential, P600, error-related negativity, feedbackerror-related negativity, contingent negative variation, readiness potential,lateralized readiness potential, motor potential, re-afferent potential) thatassess perceptual, cognitive, and motor processing. Then, we introduce ERPstudies in social neuroscience on contextual effects on speech, emotionalprocessing, empathy, and decision making. We provide an outline of ERPs'relevance and applications in the field of social cognitive neuroscience. We alsointroduce important methodological issues that extend classical ERP research,such as intracranial recordings (iERP) and source location in dense arrays andsimultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging recordings. Further, thisreview discusses possible caveats of the ERP question assessment onneuroanatomical areas, biophysical origin, and methodological problems, and theirrelevance to explanatory pluralism and multilevel, contextual, and situatedapproaches to social neuroscience.
 The present study examined the neural mechanisms of attention modulation ontiming using ERP and sLORETA measurements in a dual-task paradigm. Weparametrically varied the attention to the durations of a 1000-Hz pure tone andfurther localized the cortical regions that were sensitive to the attentionmodulation on timing. Results demonstrated that the attention modulation mighthappen at early stage, approximately 200 ms after stimulus presentation. The P2component at frontal area served as an early neural correlate of attentioneffects on timing. More importantly, the contingent negative variation (CNV)appeared at fronto-central area was sensitive to the attention effect. Inaddition, the supplementary motor area (SMA) was assumed to be one of the keyregions for selectively attending to and estimating time. These findings provide temporal and spatial correlates of attention-modulated time processing andpotentially help to investigate the neural mechanisms of patients with timeperception deficits.
 Stress has been identified as a main factor involved in the cognitive changesthat occur during the aging process. This study investigated sex differences inthe relationship between the magnitude of the acute stress-induced salivarycortisol response and memory performance among middle-aged people. To this end,16 men and 16 women (aged 54-72 years) were exposed to the Trier Social StressTest and a control condition in a crossover design. Afterwards their memoryperformance was measured using a standardized memory test (Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test). Only among women, there was an acute impact of stress on memoryperformance and a significant relationship between a higher cortisol response to the stressor and poorer memory performance in both the stress and controlconditions. Additionally, a poorer memory performance was related to earliertiming of sexual maturation (age at menarche), which was also marginally related to higher cortisol reactivity to stress. These results confirm that sex is acritical factor in the relationship between cortisol and poor memory performance.Furthermore, the findings emphasize a strong link between the individual cortisolresponse to stress and memory functioning among postmenopausal women.
 Understanding how a human brain creates a human mind ultimately depends onmapping psychological categories and concepts to physical measurements of neural response. Although it has long been assumed that emotional, social, and cognitivephenomena are realized in the operations of separate brain regions or brainnetworks, we demonstrate that it is possible to understand the body ofneuroimaging evidence using a framework that relies on domain general,distributed structure-function mappings. We review current research in affective and social neuroscience and argue that the emerging science of large-scaleintrinsic brain networks provides a coherent framework for a domain-generalfunctional architecture of the human brain.
 BACKGROUND: Oxytocin (OXT) modulates several aspects of social behavior.Intranasal OXT is a leading candidate for treating social deficits in patientswith autism spectrum disorder, and common genetic variants in the human OXTR geneare associated with emotion recognition, relationship quality, and autismspectrum disorder. Animal models have revealed that individual differences inOxtr expression in the brain drive social behavior variation. Our understandingof how genetic variation contributes to brain OXTR expression is very limited.METHODS: We investigated Oxtr expression in monogamous prairie voles, which have a well-characterized OXT system. We quantified brain region-specific levels ofOxtr messenger RNA and oxytocin receptor protein with established neuroanatomicmethods. We used pyrosequencing to investigate allelic imbalance of Oxtr mRNA, a molecular signature of polymorphic genetic regulatory elements. We performednext-generation sequencing to discover variants in and near the Oxtr gene. Weinvestigated social attachment using the partner preference test. RESULTS: Ourallelic imbalance data demonstrate that genetic variants contribute to individualdifferences in Oxtr expression, but only in particular brain regions, includingthe nucleus accumbens, where oxytocin receptor signaling facilitates socialattachment. Next-generation sequencing identified one polymorphism in the Oxtrintron, near a putative cis-regulatory element, explaining 74% of the variance instriatal Oxtr expression specifically. Males homozygous for the high expressingallele display enhanced social attachment. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, thesefindings provide convincing evidence for robust genetic influence on Oxtrexpression and provide novel insights into how noncoding polymorphisms in OXTRmight influence individual differences in human social cognition and behavior.
 The discovery of mirror neurons in motor areas of the brain has led many toassume that our ability to understand other people's behaviour partially relieson vicarious activations of motor cortices. This Review focuses the limelight of social neuroscience on a different set of brain regions: the somatosensorycortices. These have anatomical connections that enable them to have a role invisual and auditory social perception. Studies that measure brain activity while participants witness the sensations, actions and somatic pain of othersconsistently show vicarious activation in the somatosensory cortices.Neuroscientists are starting to understand how the brain adds a somatosensorydimension to our perception of other people.
 Traumatic events such as natural disasters, violent crimes, tragic accidents, andwar, can have devastating impacts on social relationships, including maritalpartnerships. We developed a single prolonged stress (SPS) paradigm, whichconsisted of restraint, forced swimming, and ether anesthesia, to establish ananimal model relevant to post-traumatic stress disorder. We applied a SPSparadigm to a monogamous rodent, the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) in orderto determine whether a traumatic event affects the establishment of pair bonds.We did not detect effects of the SPS treatment on anhedonic or anxiety-likebehavior. Sham-treated male voles huddled with their partner females, following a6day cohabitation, for a longer duration than with a novel female, indicative of a pair bond. In contrast, SPS-treated voles indiscriminately huddled with thenovel and partner females. Interestingly, the impairment of pair bonding wasrescued by oral administration of paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptakeinhibitor (SSRI), after the SPS treatment. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that oxytocin immunoreactivity (IR) was significantly decreased in the supraopticnucleus (SON), but not in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), 7days after SPStreatment, and recovered 14days after SPS treatment. After the presentation of a partner female, oxytocin neurons labeled with Fos IR was significantly increased in SPS-treated voles compared with sham-treated voles regardless of paroxetineadministration. Our results suggest that traumatic events disturb the formationof pair bond possibly through an interaction with the serotonergic system, andthat SSRIs are candidates for the treatment of social problems caused bytraumatic events. Further, a vole SPS model may be useful for understandingmechanisms underlying the impairment of social bonding by traumatic events.
 Social behavior is regulated by conserved neural networks across vertebrates.Variation in the organization of neuropeptide systems across these networks isthought to contribute to individual and species diversity in network functionduring social contexts. For example, oxytocin (OT) is an ancient neuropeptidethat binds to OT receptors (OTRs) in the brain and modulates social andreproductive behavior across vertebrate species, including humans. Central OTRsexhibit extraordinarily diverse expression patterns that are associated withindividual and species differences in social behavior. In voles, OTR density inthe nucleus accumbens (NAc)-a region important for social and reward learning-is associated with individual and species variation in social attachment behavior.Here we test whether OTRs in the NAc modulate a social salience network (SSN)-anetwork of interconnected brain nuclei thought to encode valence and incentivesalience of sociosensory cues-during a social context in the socially monogamous male prairie vole. Using a selective OTR antagonist, we test whether activationof OTRs in the NAc during sociosexual interaction and mating modulates expressionof the immediate early gene product Fos across nuclei of the SSN. We show thatblockade of endogenous OTR signaling in the NAc during sociosexual interactionand mating does not strongly modulate levels of Fos expression in individualnodes of the network, but strongly modulates patterns of correlated Fosexpression between the NAc and other SSN nuclei.
 Deja vu (DV) is a widespread, fascinating and mysterious human experience. Itoccurs both in health and in disease, notably as an aura of temporal lobeepilepsy. This feeling of inappropriate familiarity has attracted interest frompsychologists and neuroscientists for over a century, but still there is nowidely agreed explanation for the phenomenon of non-pathological DV. Here weinvestigated differences in brain morphology between healthy subjects with andwithout DV using a novel multivariate neuroimaging technique, Source-BasedMorphometry. The analysis revealed a set of cortical (predominantlymesiotemporal) and subcortical regions in which there was significantly less graymatter in subjects reporting DV. In these regions gray matter volume wasinversely correlated with the frequency of DV. Our results demonstrate astructural correlate of DV in healthy individuals for the first time and support a neurological explanation for the phenomenon. We hypothesis that the observedlocal gray matter decrease in subjects experiencing DV reflects an alteration of hippocampal function and postnatal neurogenesis with resulting changes of volume in remote brain regions.
 Diverse neurological and psychiatric conditions are marked by a diminished sense of positive self-regard, and reductions in self-esteem are associated with riskfor these disorders. Recent evidence has shown that the connectivity offrontostriatal circuitry reflects individual differences in self-esteem. However,it remains an open question as to whether the integrity of these connections can predict self-esteem changes over larger timescales. Using diffusion magneticresonance imaging and probabilistic tractography, we demonstrate that theintegrity of white matter pathways linking the medial prefrontal cortex to theventral striatum predicts changes in self-esteem 8 months after initial scanning in a sample of 30 young adults. Individuals with greater integrity of thispathway during the scanning session at Time 1 showed increased levels ofself-esteem at follow-up, whereas individuals with lower integrity showed stifledor decreased levels of self-esteem. These results provide evidence thatfrontostriatal white matter integrity predicts the trajectory of self-esteemdevelopment in early adulthood, which may contribute to blunted levels ofpositive self-regard seen in multiple psychiatric conditions, includingdepression and anxiety.
 Human behavior is strongly influenced by the presence of others. Obtaining a goodreputation or avoiding a bad one is a powerful incentive for a plethora of human actions. Theoretical considerations suggest that reputation may be a key mediatorof aspects of altruistic behavior that are uniquely human. Despite itsconsiderable influence on human social behavior and the growing interest insocial neuroscience, investigations of the neural basis of reputation-baseddecision-making are still in their infancy. Here, I argue that reputation is animportant aspect of human social cognition and present some of the candidateneural mechanisms.
 The current research explored the impact of cortical frontal asymmetry(left-lateralization effect) and Behavioral Activation System (BAS) on Substance Use Disorder (SUD) in decisional processes using the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT).Forty SUD participants and forty-two controls (CG) were tested using the IGT.Behavioral responses (gain/loss options), BIS/BAS scores and lateralized alphaband modulation (LTA) were considered. The SUD group increased the tendency toopt in favor of the immediate reward (loss strategy) more than the long-termoption (win strategy) compared to the CG. Secondly, higher reward-subscale scoreswere observed in SUD. Thirdly, SUD showed an increase in left-hemisphereactivation in response to losing (with immediate reward) choices in comparisonwith the CG. An imbalanced left hemispheric effect related to higher BAS traitcould explain this "reward bias," because these components were found to explain (through the regression analysis) the main behavioral deficits.
 The current study examined the relationship among paternal and maternal corporal punishment (CP), children's executive function (EF), and children's externalizingbehavior problems. In total, 328 Chinese preschool-aged children and theirparents and teachers participated. Paternal and maternal CP was assessed byfather-reports and by mother-reports, respectively. Children's EF was assessed bythe Executive Function Touch program. Children's externalizing behavior problems were assessed by mother-reports and by teacher-reports. The results of structuralequation modeling generally supported working memory as a mediator linkingpaternal CP and children's externalizing behaviors and inhibitory control as amediator linking maternal CP and children's externalizing behaviors. Nodifferences by children's gender were found. The current findings highlight theimportance of EF in behavioral outcomes of children who experience parental CP.
 Impaired biosynthesis of Allopregnanolone (ALLO), a brain endogenousneurosteroid, has been associated with numerous behavioral dysfunctions, whichrange from anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors to aggressive behavior andchanges in responses to contextual fear conditioning in rodent models ofemotional dysfunction. Recent animal research also demonstrates a critical roleof ALLO in social isolation. Although there are likely aspects of perceivedsocial isolation that are uniquely human, there is also continuity acrossspecies. Both human and animal research show that perceived social isolation(which can be defined behaviorally in animals and humans) has detrimental effectson physical health, such as increased hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA)activity, decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, andincreased depressive behavior. The similarities between animal and human researchsuggest that perceived social isolation (loneliness) may also be associated with a reduction in the synthesis of ALLO, potentially by reducing BDNF regulation andincreasing HPA activity through the hippocampus, amygdala, and bed nucleus of thestria terminalis (BNST), especially during social threat processing. Accordingly,exogenous administration of ALLO (or ALLO precursor, such as pregnenolone), inhumans may help alleviate loneliness. Congruent with our hypothesis, exogenousadministration of ALLO (or ALLO precursors) in humans has been shown to improvevarious stress-related disorders that show similarities between animals andhumans i.e., post-traumatic stress disorders, traumatic brain injuries. Because agrowing body of evidence demonstrates the benefits of ALLO in socially isolatedanimals, we believe our ALLO hypothesis can be applied to loneliness in humans,as well.
 Poor social networks and decreased levels of social support are associated withworse mood, health, and cognition in younger and older adults. Yet, we know very little about the brain substrates associated with social networks and socialsupport, particularly in older adults. This study examined functional brainsubstrates associated with social networks using the Social Network Index (SNI)and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Resting-statefMRI data from 28 non-demented older adults were analyzed with independentcomponents analyses. As expected, four established resting-statenetworks-previously linked to motor, vision, speech, and other languagefunctions-correlated with the quality (SNI-1: total number of high-contact roles of a respondent) and quantity (SNI-2: total number of individuals in arespondent's social network) of social networks: a sensorimotor, a visual, avestibular/insular, and a left frontoparietal network. Moreover, SNI-1 wasassociated with greater functional connectivity in the lateral prefrontal regionsof the left frontoparietal network, while SNI-2 was associated with greaterfunctional connectivity in the medial prefrontal regions of this network. Thus,lateral prefrontal regions may be particularly linked to the quality of socialnetworks while medial prefrontal regions may be particularly linked to thequantity of social networks.
 Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental conditionsprimarily characterized by abnormalities in social cognition. Abundant previousfunctional MRI studies have shown atypical activity in networks encompassingmedial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and medial parietal regions corresponding toposterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (PCC/PCU). Conversely, studies assessingstructural brain anomalies in ASD have been rather inconsistent. The current workevaluated whether structural changes in ASD can be reliability detected in alarge multicenter dataset. Our comprehensive structural MRI framework encompassedcortical thickness mapping and structural covariance analysis based on threeindependent samples comprising individuals with ASD and controls (n = 220),selected from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange open-access database.Surface-based analysis revealed increased cortical thickness in ASD relative tocontrols in mPFC and lateral prefrontal cortex. Clusters encompassing mPFC wereembedded in altered inter-regional covariance networks, showing decreasedcovariance in ASD relative to controls primarily to PCC/PCU and inferior parietalregions. Cortical thickness increases and covariance reductions in ASD wereconsistent, yet of variable effect size, across the different sites evaluated andmeasurable both in children and adults. Our multisite study shows regional andnetwork-level structural alterations in mPFC in ASD that, possibly, relate toatypical socio-cognitive functions in this condition.
 Abstract A neuroanatomical model of urge-for-action phenomena has been proposedbased on the "motivation-for-action" network (e.g., insula and mid-cingulatecortex). Notwithstanding the sound evidence presented regarding the functionaland anatomical correlates of this model, the nature of the relationship betweenurges and conscious awareness remains to be addressed. Moreover, this model does not seem to explain (1) how a conscious access threshold is reached, and (2) the way in which the urges are related to more general contents of consciousness.
 Deciphering the neural mechanisms of social behavior has propelled the growth of social neuroscience. The exact computations of the social brain, however, remain elusive. Here we investigated how the human brain tracks ongoing changes insocial relationships using functional neuroimaging. Participants were leadcharacters in a role-playing game in which they were to find a new home and a jobthrough interactions with virtual cartoon characters. We found that atwo-dimensional geometric model of social relationships, a "social space" framed by power and affiliation, predicted hippocampal activity. Moreover, participants who reported better social skills showed stronger covariance between hippocampal activity and "movement" through "social space." The results suggest that thehippocampus is crucial for social cognition, and imply that beyond framingphysical locations, the hippocampus computes a more general, inclusive, abstract,and multidimensional cognitive map consistent with its role in episodic memory.
 Our social abilities depend on specialized brain systems that allow us to performcrucial operations such as interpreting the actions of others. This functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated whether human brain activityevoked by the observation of social interactions is modulated by gaze. Duringscanning participants observed social or individual actions performed by agentswhose gaze could be either available or masked. Results demonstrated that theobservation of social interactions evoked activity within a dorsal sector of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), an area classically involved in socialcognition. Importantly, activity within this area was modulated by whether thegaze of the agents performing the observed action was or was not available. Theimplications of these findings for a role played by the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) in terms of inferential processes concerned with socialinteractions are considered.
 Narcissism is characterized by a preoccupation with fantasies of unlimitedsuccess, power, beauty, and similar values, which has been discussed asintra-individual regulation of a grandiose, but vulnerable self-concept. Toexplore where the narcissistic mind wanders, we used an experience-samplingapproach in a sample with large variability in pathological narcissism inventory scores. Multilevel modeling revealed (1) more mind-wandering in participants withhigher levels of narcissism and (2) a difference in the content of these thoughts(more self- and other-related, past and future oriented, negative content).Critically, (3) in high levels of narcissism, the self-related thoughts wereassociated with more positive valence and were also more future oriented. Theresults demonstrate the validity of the assumed grandiose, self-absorbed view of oneself in narcissism, which includes self-indulgent fantasies of future success.We also found additional evidence for negative, past-oriented thoughts innarcissism, a dysfunctional pattern reminiscent of rumination, possibly linked toincreased psychopathological vulnerability in narcissism.
 Although several studies have investigated the neural mechanism of socialcomparison, it remains unclear whether and how cultural membership, particularly independent versus interdependent cultures, may differentially shape the neuralprocesses underlying social comparison. In the present functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) study, we examined the behaviors and neural responsepatterns of Korean (i.e., interdependent culture) and American (i.e., independentculture) participants while performing a financial gambling task simultaneouslyand independently with a partner. Upon seeing the partner's income, greatermodulation of the activity in the ventral striatum (VS) and the ventromedialprefrontal cortex (vmPFC) by relative gain was observed in Korean than Americanparticipants, suggesting greater sensitivity of Koreans toward social comparison.The strength of functional connectivity between the VS and the vmPFC predictedindividual variability in the degree to which participants' decisions wereaffected by relative incomes. Additional model-based fMRI analysis furtherconfirmed the primary role of the vmPFC in biasing decisions based on relativeincomes. In summary, the present study provides the first neural evidence fordecision biases due to social comparison and their individual and culturalvariations.
 When deprived of compelling perceptual input, the mind is often occupied withthoughts unrelated to the immediate environment. Previous behavioral research hasshown that this self-generated task-unrelated thought (TUT), especially undernon-demanding conditions, relates to cognitive capacities such as creativity,planning, and reduced temporal discounting. Despite the frequency and importance of this type of cognition, little is known about its structural brain basis.Using MRI-based cortical thickness measures in 37 participants, we were able toshow that individuals with a higher tendency to engage in TUT under low-demandingconditions (but not under high-demanding conditions) show an increased thickness of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior/midcingulate cortex. Thickness ofthese regions also related to less temporal discounting (TD) of monetary rewards in an economic task, indicative of more patient decision-making. The findings of a shared structural substrate in mPFC and anterior/midcingulate cortex underlyingboth TUT and TD suggest an important role of these brain regions in supportingthe self-generation of information that is unrelated to the immediate environmentand which may be adaptive in nature.
 The burdens faced by military families who have a child with autism are unique.The usual challenges of securing diagnostic, treatment, and educational services are compounded by life circumstances that include the anxieties of war, frequent relocation and separation, and a demand structure that emphasizes missionreadiness and service. Recently established military autism-specific health care benefits set the stage for community-viable and cost-effective solutions that canachieve better outcomes for children and greater well-being for families. Here weargue for implementation of evidence-based solutions focused on reducing age ofdiagnosis and improving access to early intervention, as well as establishment ofa tiered menu of services, individualized to the child and family, that fit with the military ethos and system of health care. Absence of this new model of carecould compromise the utility and sustainability of the autism-specific benefit.
 Many of the instructional practices that have been advanced as intrinsicallymotivating are inherent in socio-constructivist learning environments. There isnow emerging scientific evidence to explain why interactive learning environmentspromote the intrinsic motivation to learn. The "two-body" and "second person"approaches have begun to explore the "dark matter" of social neuroscience: theintra- and inter-individual brain dynamics during social interaction. Moreover,studies indicate that when young learners are given expanded opportunities toactively and equitably participate in collaborative learning activities theyexperienced feelings of well-being, contentment, or even excitement. Neurosciencestarts demonstrating how this naturally rewarding aspect is strongly associatedwith the implication of the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway during socialinteraction. The production of dopamine reinforces the desire to continue theinteraction, and heightens feelings of anticipation for future peer-learningactivities. Here we review how cooperative learning and problem-solvinginteractions can bring about the "intrinsic" motivation to learn. Overall, thereported theoretical arguments and neuroscientific results have clearimplications for school and organization approaches and support socialconstructivist perspectives.
 It was previously shown by fMRI studies that unfair offers during an ultimatumbargaining game activate regions in the brain associated with emotions andconflict, leading to decisions inconsistent with standard economic theory. Thetemporal dynamics of emotional processing and mental attributes were not cleardue to the coarse temporal resolution in those studies ( approximately 2 s).Here, the ultimatum game was studied by EEG recorded from the responders in 19channels. EEG time series were first in-put to independent component analysis. Anequivalent current dipole model was used to localize the sources of theindependent components in EEGLAB. The Talairach coordinates of the dipoles werematched with references in the Brede neuroinformatics database. Dipolemagnitudes, anatomical regions, and mental attributes were used to explain therejection of the offers by applying multiple regression as a function of time in epochs with a median resolution of 250 ms. The results are consistent withprevious studies regarding responder behavior and activated regions (e.g.,anterior cingulate cortex, frontal gyrus, insular cortex). There are three mainfindings observed with the higher temporal resolution: (1) regression resultsfrom fine-scale temporal data showed activations not captured when the analysiswas done by using time-averaged data; (2) temporal analysis detected theindividual significant epochs and fluctuations (positive and negativecorrelations) in regions and for the associated mental attributes (e.g.,reward/harm perception, anger, unfairness); (3) there was a sequential activationof anterior cingulate cortex and insular cortex, respectively, leading to therejection response. Overall, regression models could explain a large percentage (approximately 80%) of out-of-sample behavioral responses. The results arepromising for the prospect of using EEG and source localization techniques inneuroeconomics to study finer temporal dynamics of neural activation.
 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, "ecstasy") enhances desire to socialize and feelings of empathy, which are thought to be related to increased oxytocinlevels. Thus, variation in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) may influenceresponses to the drug. Here, we examined the influence of a single OXTRnucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on responses to MDMA in humans. Based on findingsthat carriers of the A allele at rs53576 exhibit reduced sensitivity tooxytocin-induced social behavior, we hypothesized that these individuals wouldshow reduced subjective responses to MDMA, including sociability. In thisthree-session, double blind, within-subjects study, healthy volunteers with past MDMA experience (N = 68) received a MDMA (0, 0.75 mg/kg, and 1.5 mg/kg) andprovided self-report ratings of sociability, anxiety, and drug effects. Theseresponses were examined in relation to rs53576. MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) did not increasesociability in individuals with the A/A genotype as it did in G allele carriers. The genotypic groups did not differ in responses at the lower MDMA dose, or incardiovascular or other subjective responses. These findings are consistent with the idea that MDMA-induced sociability is mediated by oxytocin, and thatvariation in the oxytocin receptor gene may influence responses to the drug.
 Prior studies have implicated the superior temporal sulcus region for processing various types of biological motion in children and adults. However, no previousresearch in children compared this activity to that involved in coherent,meaningful, non-biological motion perception to show specificity for biologicalmotion processing. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imagingto explore which brain regions were specific for biological motion in 7- to10-year-old children. We compared brain activity in response to biological motionby a biological figure (a walking human); biological motion by a non-biologicalfigure (a walking robot); disorganized, non-biological motion by a disjointedmechanical figure; and organized, non-biological motion by a grandfather clock.We identified a network of brain regions that had a greater response evoked bybiological than by non-biological motion, including the superior temporal sulcus and mirror neuron regions. Additionally, we found a developmental changesuggesting increasing specificity for biological motion with age in the superior temporal sulcus region. We discuss these results in the context of research andtheory that has emphasized the important role of biological motion perception in the development of theory-of-mind abilities.
 Although active listening is an influential behavior, which can affect the socialresponses of others, the neural correlates underlying its perception haveremained unclear. Sensing active listening in social interactions is accompanied by an improvement in the recollected impressions of relevant experiences and isthought to arouse positive feelings. We therefore hypothesized that therecognition of active listening activates the reward system, and that theemotional appraisal of experiences that had been subject to active listeningwould be improved. To test these hypotheses, we conducted functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) on participants viewing assessments of their ownpersonal experiences made by evaluators with or without active listeningattitude. Subjects rated evaluators who showed active listening more positively. Furthermore, they rated episodes more positively when they were evaluated byindividuals showing active listening. Neural activation in the ventral striatumwas enhanced by perceiving active listening, suggesting that this was processedas rewarding. It also activated the right anterior insula, representing positive emotional reappraisal processes. Furthermore, the mentalizing network wasactivated when participants were being evaluated, irrespective of activelistening behavior. Therefore, perceiving active listening appeared to result in positive emotional appraisal and to invoke mental state attribution to the activelistener.
 Social interactions are central to most animals and have a fundamental impactupon the phenotype of an individual. Social behavior (social interactions amongconspecifics) represents a central challenge to the integration of the functionaland mechanistic bases of complex behavior. Traditionally, studies of proximateand ultimate elements of social behavior have been conducted by distinct groupsof researchers, with little communication across perceived disciplinaryboundaries. However, recent technological advances, coupled with increasedrecognition of the substantial variation in mechanisms underlying socialinteractions, should compel investigators from divergent disciplines to pursuemore integrative analyses of social behavior. We propose an integrativeconceptual framework intended to guide researchers towards a comprehensiveunderstanding of the evolution and maintenance of mechanisms governing variation in sociality.
 Processing emotional body expressions has become recently an important topic inaffective and social neuroscience along with the investigation of facialexpressions. The objective of the study is to review the literature on emotional body expressions in order to discuss the current state of knowledge on this topicand identify directions for future research. The following electronic databaseswere searched: PsychINFO, Ebsco, ERIC, ProQuest, Sagepub, and SCOPUS using terms such as "body," "bodily expression," "body perception," "emotions," "posture,""body recognition" and combinations of them. The synthesis revealed severalresearch questions that were addressed in neuroimaging, electrophysiological and behavioral studies. Among them, one important question targeted the neuralmechanisms of emotional processing of body expressions to specific subsectionsregarding the time course for the integration of emotional signals from face and body, as well as the role of context in the perception of emotional signals.Processing bodily expression of emotion is similar to processing facialexpressions, and the holistic processing is extended to the whole person. Thecurrent state-of-the-art in processing emotional body expressions may lead to abetter understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of social behavior. Atthe end of the review, suggestions for future research directions are presented.
 This article is part of a Special Issue "Parental Care". Mother-infant bonding isa characteristic of virtually all mammals. The maternal neural system may haveprovided the scaffold upon which other types of social bonds in mammals have beenbuilt. For example, most mammals exhibit a polygamous mating system, but monogamyand pair bonding between mating partners occur in ~5% of mammalian species. Inmammals, it is plausible that the neural mechanisms that promote mother-infantbonding have been modified by natural selection to establish the capacity todevelop a selective bond with a mate during the evolution of monogamous matingstrategies. Here we compare the details of the neural mechanisms that promotemother-infant bonding in rats and other mammals with those that underpin pairbond formation in the monogamous prairie vole. Although details remain to beresolved, remarkable similarities and a few differences between the mechanismsunderlying these two types of bond formation are revealed. For example, amygdala and nucleus accumbens-ventral pallidum (NA-VP) circuits are involved in bothtypes of bond formation, and dopamine and oxytocin actions within NA appear topromote the synaptic plasticity that allows either infant or mating partnerstimuli to persistently activate NA-VP attraction circuits, leading to anenduring social attraction and bonding. Further, although the medial preopticarea is essential for maternal behavior, its role in pair bonding remains to bedetermined. Our review concludes by examining the broader implications of thiscomparative analysis, and evidence is provided that the maternal care system may have also provided the basic neural foundation for other types of strong socialrelationships, beyond pair bonding, in mammals, including humans.
 The construct of "addiction memory" (AM) and its importance for relapseoccurrence has been the subject of discussion for the past 30 years.Neurobiological findings from "social neuroscience" and biopsychological learningtheory, in conjunction with construct-valid behavioral pharmacological animalmodels, can now also provide general confirmation of addiction memory as apathomorphological correlate of addiction disorders. Under multifactorialinfluences, experience-driven neuronal learning and memory processes of emotionaland cognitive processing patterns in the specific individual "set" and "setting" play an especially pivotal role in this connection. From a neuropsychologicalperspective, the episodic (biographical) memory, located at the highesthierarchical level, is of central importance for the formation of the AM incertain structural and functional areas of the brain and neuronal networks.Within this context, neuronal learning and conditioning processes take place moreor less unconsciously and automatically in the preceding long-term-memory systems(in particular priming and perceptual memory). They then regulate theindividually programmed addiction behavior implicitly and thus subsequently standfor facilitated recollection of corresponding, previously stored cues or context situations. This explains why it is so difficult to treat an addiction memory,which is embedded above all in the episodic memory, from the molecular carrierlevel via the neuronal pattern level through to the psychological meaning level, and has thus meanwhile become a component of personality.
 We tested the ability of the mature visual system for discrimination betweentypes of elliptic biological motion on the basis of event kinematics. Healthyadult volunteers were presented with point-light displays depicting ellipticmotion when only a single dot, a moving point-light arm, or a whole point-lighthuman figure was visible. The displays were created in accordance with thetwo-thirds power kinematic law (natural motion), whereas the control displaysviolated this principle (unnatural motion). On each trial, participants judgedwhether the display represented natural or unnatural motion. The findingsindicate that adults are highly sensitive to violation of the two-thirds powerkinematic law. Notably, participants can easily discriminate between natural and unnatural motions without recognising the stimuli, which suggests that peopleimplicitly use kinematic information. Most intriguing, event recognition seems todiminish the capacity to judge whether event kinematics is unnatural. We discuss possible ways for a cross-talk between perception and production of biologicalmovement, and the brain mechanisms involved in biological motion processing.
 Testosterone to cortisol (T/C) ratios could be associated with feelings andexpression of anger as high testosterone and low cortisol levels indicate apredisposition to violence. The basal T/C ratio has recently been proposed as amarker for proneness to social aggression; so far, however, only its value as an indicator of state anger or violence has been investigated. Given this, we aimed to establish whether the T/C ratio response to acute stress was a specificpsychobiological feature in individuals with a history of violence, namely,perpetrators of intimate partner violence (IPV). T/C ratio and anger responseswere compared in men jailed for IPV and controls using the Trier Social StressTest. IPV perpetrators had higher T/C ratios than controls, during thepreparation period, and 15 and 30 minutes post-task. In IPV perpetrators, highT/C ratios were linked to better self-esteem and good mental health. An increase in anger may increase proneness to violence by altering hormones and, thereby,increasing T/C ratios. The basal T/C ratio together with acute stress responsesand other indicators could serve as a marker to identify men at high risk ofreacting violently to their partners.
 OBJECTIVES: Several lines of evidence suggest an adverse effect of psychoticepisodes on brain morphology. It is not clear if this relationship reflects thecumulative effect of psychotic outbursts on the gradual progressive reduction of hippocampal tissue or an increased tendency toward psychotic episodes in patientswith a smaller hippocampus at the beginning of the illness. METHODS: This is alongitudinal 4-year prospective study of patients with first-episodeschizophrenia (FES, N = 58). Baseline brain anatomical scans (at FES) wereanalysed using voxel-based morphometry and atlas-based volumetry of thehippocampal subfields. The effects of first-episode duration on the hippocampalmorphology, and the effect of baseline hippocampal morphology on illness coursewith relapses, number of psychotic episodes and residual symptoms were analysed. RESULTS: A significant negative correlation was detected between first-episodeduration and baseline hippocampal morphology. Relapse, number of psychoticepisodes and residual symptoms had no correlation with baseline hippocampalvolume. CONCLUSIONS: We replicated the effect of psychosis duration onhippocampal volume already at the time first-episode, which supports the concept of toxicity of psychosis. The indices of a later unfavourable course ofschizophrenia had no correlation with baseline brain morphology, suggesting that there is no baseline morphological abnormality of the hippocampus thatpredisposes the patient to frequent psychotic outbursts.
 The mark/rouge test has been used to assess mirror self-recognition (MSR) in manyspecies. Despite consistent evidence of MSR in great apes, genetic or non-geneticfactors may account for the individual differences in behavioral responses thathave been reported. We examined whether vasopressin receptor gene (AVPR1A)polymorphisms are associated with MSR-related behaviors in chimpanzees sincevasopressin has been implicated in the development and evolution of complexsocial relations and cognition and chimpanzees are polymorphic for the presenceof the RS3-containing DupB region. We compared a sample of DupB+/- and DupB-/-chimpanzees on a mark test to assess its role on social behavior toward a mirror.Chimpanzees were administered two, 10-min sessions where frequencies ofmirror-guided self-directed behaviors, contingent actions and other socialbehaviors were recorded. Approximately one-third showed evidence of MSR and theseindividuals exhibited more mirror-guided self-exploratory behaviors and mouthcontingent actions than chimpanzees not classified as passers. Moreover, DupB+/- males exhibited more scratching and agonistic behaviors than other male andfemale cohorts. Our findings support previous studies demonstrating individualdifferences in MSR abilities in chimpanzees and suggest that AVPR1A partlyexplains individual differences in MSR by influencing the behavioral reactions ofchimpanzees in front of a mirror.
 Empathy involves an understanding of what others are thinking and feeling, andenables us to interact in the social world. According to theEmpathizing-Systemizing (E-S) theory, females on average have a stronger drive toempathize than males. This sex difference may in part reflect developmentaldifferences in brain structure and function, which are themselves under theinfluence of fetal testosterone (fT). Previous studies have found that fT isinversely correlated with social behaviors such as eye contact in infancy, peerrelationships in preschoolers, and mentalistic interpretation of animate motion. Male fetuses are exposed to higher levels of testosterone than are femalefetuses. The present study investigates empathizing in children, as a function ofamniotic measures of fT. One hundred ninety-three mothers of children (100 males,93 females) aged 6-8 years of age completed children's versions of the EmpathyQuotient (EQ-C), and the children themselves were tested on "Reading the Mind in the Eyes" Task (Eyes-C). All mothers had had amniocentesis during the 2ndtrimester of pregnancy. There was a significant negative correlation between fTand scores on both measures. While empathy may be influenced by post-natalexperience, these results suggest that pre-natal biology also plays an important role, mediated by androgen effects in the brain. These results also haveimplications for the causes of disabilities involving empathy, such as autismspectrum conditions, and may explain the increased rate of such conditions among males.
 Social comparison, a widespread phenomenon in human society, has been found toaffect outcome evaluation. The need to belong to a social group may result indistinct neural responses to diverse social comparison outcomes. To extendprevious studies by examining how social comparison with hierarchicalcharacteristics is temporally processed, electroencephalography responses wererecorded in the current study. Participants played a lottery game with twopseudo-players simultaneously and received both their own and the other twoplayers' outcomes. Results of three event-related potential components, includingthe P2, the feedback-related negativity (FRN), and the late positive component(LPC), indicate that social comparison manifests in three stages. First, outcomesindicating a different performance from others elicited a larger P2 thanevenness. Second, the FRN showed hierarchical sensitivity to social comparisonoutcomes. This effect manifested asymmetrically. Finally, large differencebetween the participant's outcome and the other two players' evoked a larger LPC than the medium difference and the even condition. We suggest that during social comparison, people detect if there is any difference between self and others, andthen evaluate the information of this difference hierarchically, and finallyinterpret the situations in which oneself deviates from the group as mostmotivationally salient.
 Observing the pain of others has been shown to elicit greater activation insensory and emotional areas of the brain suggested to represent a neural markerof empathy. This modulation of brain responses to others' pain is dependent onthe race of the observed person, such that observing own-race people in pain isassociated with greater activity in the anterior cingulate and bilateral insulacortices compared to other-race people. Importantly, it is not known how thisracial bias to pain in other-race individuals might change over time in newimmigrants or might depend on the level and quality of contact with people of theother-race. We investigated these issues by recruiting Chinese students who hadfirst arrived in Australia within the past 6 months to 5 years and assessingtheir level of contact with other races across different social contexts usingcomprehensive rating scales. During fMRI, participants observed videos ofown-race/other-race individuals, as well as own-group/other-group individuals,receiving painful or non-painful touch. The typical racial bias in neuralresponses to observed pain was evident, whereby activation in the anteriorcingulate cortex (ACC) was greater for pain in own-race compared to other-racepeople. Crucially, activation in the anterior cingulate to pain in other racesincreased significantly with the level of contact participants reported withpeople of the other race. Importantly, this correlation did not depend on thecloseness of contact or personal relationships, but simply on the overall levelof experience with people of the other race in their every-day environment.Racial bias in neural responses to others' pain, as a neural marker of empathy,therefore changes with experience in new immigrants at least within 5 years ofarrival in the new society and, crucially, depends on the level of contact withpeople of the other race in every-day life contexts.
 STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine whether subjective sleep quality and sleep duration moderate the association between age and telomere length (TL). DESIGN:Participants completed a demographic and sleep quality questionnaire, followed bya blood draw. SETTING: Social Neuroscience Laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty-four middle-aged to older adults (age 45-77 y) participated. Participantswere excluded if they were on immunosuppressive treatment and/or had a diseasewith a clear immunologic (e.g., cancer) component. INTERVENTIONS: N/A.MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Subjective sleep quality and sleep duration wereassessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and TL was determinedusing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). There was a significantfirst-order negative association between age and TL. Age was also negativelyassociated with the self-reported sleep quality item and sleep duration componentof the PSQI. A significant age x self-reported sleep quality interaction revealedthat age was more strongly related to TL among poor sleepers, and that good sleepquality attenuated the association between age and TL. Moreover, adequatesubjective sleep duration among older adults (i.e. greater than 7 h per night)was associated with TL comparable to that in middle-aged adults, whereas sleepduration was unrelated to TL for the middle-aged adults in our study.CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides evidence for an association between sleepquality, sleep duration, and cellular aging. Among older adults, bettersubjective sleep quality was associated with the extent of cellular aging,suggesting that sleep duration and sleep quality may be added to a growing listof modifiable behaviors associated with the adverse effects of aging.
 Numerous studies have shown there exist attention biases for self-related andnegative stimuli. Few studies, however, have been carried out to compare theeffects of such stimuli on the neural mechanisms of early attentional alertnessand subsequent cognitive processing. The purpose of the present study was toexamine the temporal primacy of both self-related stimuli and negative stimuli inthe neurophysiologic level. In a modified oddball task, event-related potentials of the deviant stimuli (i.e., self-face, negative face and neutral face) wererecorded. Results revealed that larger P2 amplitudes were elicited byself-related and negative stimuli than by neutral stimuli. Negative stimuli,however, elicited shorter P2 latencies than self-related and neutral stimuli. As for the N2 component, self-related and negative stimuli elicited smalleramplitudes and shorter latencies than neutral stimuli, but otherwise did notdiffer. Self-related stimuli also elicited larger P3 and late positive component (LPC) amplitudes than negative and neutral stimuli. The pattern of resultssuggests that the primacy of negative stimuli occurred at an early attentionstage of processing, while the primacy of self-related stimuli occurred at thesubsequent cognitive evaluation and memory stage.
 BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that bipolar disorder (BD) ischaracterized by deficits in cognitive control (CC). Impaired CC has been foundin high-risk samples and is associated with the maintenance of BD symptoms. Itremains unclear, however, whether BD is characterized by a general deficit in CC or by a deficit that is specifically related to the processing of emotionalmaterial. METHODS: The sample consisted of 42 remitted bipolar patients and 39healthy controls (HC). We examined whether BD individuals display impaired CCwhen confronted with negative as well as positive material using an arithmeticinhibition task that required inhibition of pictorial stimulus material. RESULTS:Whereas both groups showed difficulties in exerting CC over negative material,only BD individuals exhibited deficient CC over positive material. LIMITATIONS:Even though we intended the negative and positive pictures in the arithmeticinhibition task to be similarly arousing, participants in the current study ratedthe negative compared to the positive pictures as more arousing. CONCLUSIONS: BD is associated with impaired CC when processing emotional - especially positive - stimuli even when patients are in remission. Possible implications of thisdeficit especially for emotion regulation are discussed.
 How we are viewed by other individuals-our reputation-has a considerableinfluence on our everyday behaviors and is considered an important concept inexplaining altruism, a uniquely human trait. Previously it has been proposed thatprocessing one's own reputation requires a reputation representation in themedial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and a value representation in the striatum. Here,we directly tested this idea using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Subjects disclosed their behavioral tendencies with reference to social norms in the presence or absence of other people, a manipulation that is known to greatly affect an individual's concern for their reputation. The mPFC showed strongactivation during self-referential processing, and this activity was enhanced by the mere presence of observers. Moreover, the striatum was also stronglyactivated when subjects responded in front of observers. Thus, the present study demonstrated that the mPFC and striatum were automatically recruited when thetask placed a high demand on processing how one is viewed by others. Takentogether, our findings suggest that the mPFC and the striatum play a key role in regulating human social behaviors, and these results provide valuable insightinto the neural basis of human altruism.
 Clinical psychopathology has largely ignored the developments in the field ofsocial neuroscience. The so-called moral emotions are a group of affectiveexperiences thought to promote cooperation, group cohesion, and reorganization.In this review, we: (i) briefly describe a provisional taxonomy of a limited set of moral emotions and their neural underpinnings; and (ii) discuss how disgust,guilt, anger/indignation, and shame/embarrassment can be conceptualized as keyaffective experiences in different neuropsychiatric disorders. Based on a concisereview of the literature linking moral emotions, psychopathology, andneuropsychiatry, we have devised a simple and preliminary scheme where weconjecture how specific moral emotions can be implicated in some categories ofDSM-5 diagnoses, potentially helping to bridge psychopathology andneurobiologically plausible variables, in line with the Research Domain Criteria initiative. We hope this stimulates new empirical work exploring how moralemotional changes and their underlying neurobiology can help elucidating theneural underpinnings of mental disorders.
 Individuals with genotypes that code for reduced dopaminergic brain activityoften exhibit a predisposition toward aggression. However, it remains largelyunknown how dopaminergic genotypes may increase aggression. Lower-functioningdopamine systems motivate individuals to seek reward from external sources suchas illicit drugs and other risky experiences. Based on emerging evidence thataggression is a rewarding experience, we predicted that the effect oflower-functioning dopaminergic functioning on aggression would be mediated bytendencies to seek the environment for rewards. Caucasian female and maleundergraduates (N = 277) were genotyped for five polymorphisms of the dopamine D2receptor (DRD2) gene; they reported their previous history of aggression andtheir dispositional reward-seeking. Lower-functioning DRD2 profiles wereassociated with greater sensation-seeking, which then predicted greateraggression. Our findings suggest that lower-functioning dopaminergic activityputs individuals at risk for violence because it motivates them to experienceaggression's hedonically rewarding qualities.
 Typical adult observers demonstrate enhanced behavioral sensitivity to humanmovement compared to animal movement. Yet, the neural underpinnings of thiseffect are unknown. We examined the tuning of brain mechanisms for the perceptionof biological motion to the social relevance of this category of motion bycomparing neural response to human and non-human biological motion. Inparticular, we tested the hypothesis that the response of the right posteriorsuperior temporal sulcus (pSTS) varies according to the social relevance of themotion, responding most strongly to those biological motions with the greatestsocial relevance (human > dog). During a functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) session, typical adults viewed veridical point-light displays of human,dog, and tractor motions created from motion capture data. A conjunction analysisidentified regions of significant activation during biological motion perception relative to object motion. Within each of these regions, only one brain area, theright pSTS, revealed an enhanced response to human motion relative to dog motion.This finding demonstrates that the pSTS response is sensitive to the socialrelevance of a biological motion stimulus.
 Recent research demonstrated structural overlap between reward and selfprocessing, but the functional relationship that explains how self processinginfluences reward processing remains unclear. The present study used anexperimentally constrained reflection task to investigate whether individuals'outcome evaluations in a gambling task are modulated by task-unrelated self- and other-reflection processes. The self- and other-reflection task containeddescriptions of the self or others, and brain event-related potentials (ERPs)were recorded while 16 normal adults performed a gambling task. The ERP analysis focused on the feedback-related negativity (FRN) component. We found that thedifference wave of FRN increased in the self-reflection condition compared withthe other-reflection condition. The present findings provide direct evidence thatself processing can influence reward processing.
 Why do people act altruistically? One theory is that empathy is a driver ofmorality. Experimental studies of this are often confined to laboratory settings,which often lack ecological validity. In the present study we investigatedwhether empathy traits predict if people will act altruistically in a real-world setting, "in the wild". We staged a situation in public that was designed toelicit helping, and subsequently measured empathic traits in those who eitherstopped to help or walked past and did not help. Results show that a highernumber of empathic traits are a significant and positive predictor for altruisticbehavior in a real-life situation. This supports the theory that the act of doinggood is correlated with empathy.
 The brain activity, considered in its hemodynamic (optical imaging: functionalNear-Infrared Spectroscopy, fNIRS) and electrophysiological components(event-related potentials, ERPs, N200) was monitored when subjects observed(visual stimulation, V) or observed and heard (visual + auditory stimulation, VU)situations which represented inter-species (human-animal) interactions, with anemotional positive (cooperative) or negative (uncooperative) content. Inaddition, the cortical lateralization effect (more left or right dorsolateralprefrontal cortex, DLPFC) was explored. Both ERP and fNIRS showed significanteffects due to emotional interactions which were discussed at light ofcross-modal integration effects. The significance of inter-species effect for theemotional behavior was considered. In addition, hemodynamic and EEG consonantresults and their value as integrated measures were discussed at light of valenceeffect.
 The depression-related personality trait is associated with the severity ofpatients' current depressive symptoms and with the vulnerability to depressionwithin the nonclinical groups. However, little is known about the anatomicalstructure associated with the depression-related personality traits within thenonclinical sample. Parenting behavior is associated with the depressionsymptoms; however, whether or not parenting behavior influence the neural basisof the depression-related personality traits is unclear. Thus in current study,first, we used voxel-based morphometry to identify the brain regions underlyingindividual differences in depression-related personality traits, as measured bythe revised Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness Personality Inventory, in a largesample of young healthy adults. Second, we use mediation analysis to investigate the relationship between parenting behavior and neural basis ofdepression-related personality traits. The results revealed thatdepression-related personality traits were positively correlated with gray mattervolume mainly in medial frontal gyrus (MFG) that is implicated in theself-referential processing and emotional regulation. Furthermore, parentalemotional warmth acted as a mediational mechanism underlying the associationbetween the MFG volume and the depression-related personality trait. Together,our findings suggested that the family environment might play an important rolein the acquisition and process of the depression-related personality traits.
 OBJECTIVE: Psychiatry residencies with a commitment to humanism commonlyprioritize training in psychotherapy, cultural psychiatry, mental health policy, promotion of human rights, and similar areas reliant upon dialogue andcollaborative therapeutic relationships. The advent of neuroscience as a definingparadigm for psychiatry has challenged residencies with a humanistic focus due tocommon perceptions that it would entail constriction of psychiatric practice todiagnostic and psychopharmacology roles. The author describes a neurosciencecurriculum that has taught psychopharmacology effectively, while also advancingeffectiveness of language-based and relationship-based therapeutics. METHODS: In 2000, the George Washington University psychiatry residency initiated aneuroscience curriculum consisting of (1) a foundational postgraduate year 2seminar teaching cognitive and social neuroscience and its integration intoclinical psychopharmacology, (2) advanced seminars that utilized a neuroscienceperspective in teaching specific psychotherapeutic skill sets, and (3) case-basedteaching in outpatient clinical supervisions that incorporated a neuroscienceperspective into traditional psychotherapy supervisions. Curricular assessmentwas conducted by (1) RRC reaccreditation site visit feedback, (2) examiningcareer trajectories of residency graduates, (3) comparing PRITE exam SomaticTreatments subscale scores for 2010-2012 residents with pre-implementationresidents, and (4) postresidency survey assessment by 2010-2012 graduates.RESULTS: The 2011 RRC site visit report recommended a "notable practice" citationfor "innovative neurosciences curriculum." Three of twenty 2010-2012 graduatesentered neuroscience research fellowships, as compared to none before the newcurriculum. PRITE Somatic Treatments subscale scores improved from the 23rdpercentile to the 62nd percentile in pre- to post-implementation of curriculum (p< .001). Recent graduates rated effectiveness of clinical psychopharmacologytraining as 8.6 on ten-point Likert scale. CONCLUSIONS: From multiple vantagepoints of assessment, these outcome results support effectiveness of thisneuroscience curriculum for a residency committed to humanistic psychiatry as itsprimary mission. As a naturalistic study, further examination of its methods inpretest and posttest assessments and a multisite comparison is warranted.
 It is well known that early experience shapes the development of visualperception for faces in humans. However, the effect of experience on thedevelopment of social attention in non-human primates is unknown. In two studies,we examined the effect of cumulative social experience on developmental changesin attention to the faces of unfamiliar conspecifics or heterospecifics, and mom versus an unfamiliar female. From birth, infant rhesus monkeys preferred to look at conspecific compared to heterospecific faces, but this pattern reversed overtime. In contrast, no consistent differences were found for attention to mom'sface compared to an unfamiliar female. These results suggest differential rolesof social experience in shaping the development of face preferences in infantmonkeys. Results have important implications for establishing normativetrajectories for the development of face preferences in an animal model of human social behavior.
 The present study examined neural responses associated with moral sensitivity in adolescents with a background of early social deprivation. Using high-densityelectroencephalography (hdEEG), brain activity was measured during an intentionalinference task, which assesses rapid moral decision-making regarding intentional or unintentional harm to people and objects. We compared the responses to thistask in a socially deprived group (DG) with that of a control group (CG). Theevent-related potentials (ERPs) results showed atypical early and late frontalcortical markers associated with attribution of intentionality during moraldecision-making in DG (especially regarding intentional harm to people). Thesource space of the hdEEG showed reduced activity for DG compared with CG in the right prefrontal cortex, bilaterally in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex(vmPFC), and right insula. Moreover, the reduced response in vmPFC for DG waspredicted by higher rates of externalizing problems. These findings demonstratethe importance of the social environment in early moral development, supporting aprefrontal maturation model of social deprivation.
 Social stress affects cognitive processes in general, and memory performance inparticular. However, the direction of these effects has not been clearlyestablished, as it depends on several factors. Our aim was to determine theimpact of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervoussystem (SNS) reactivity to psychosocial stress on short-term non-declarativememory and declarative memory performance. Fifty-two young participants (18 men, 34 women) were subjected to the Trier Social Stress Task (TSST) and a controlcondition in a crossover design. Implicit memory was assessed by a priming test, and explicit memory was assessed by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test(RAVLT). The TSST provoked greater salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase(sAA) responses than the control task. Men had a higher cortisol response tostress than women, but no sex differences were found for sAA release. Stress was associated with an enhancement of priming but did not affect declarative memory. Additionally, the enhancement on the priming test was higher in those whose sAAlevels increased more in response to stress (r(48) = 0.339, p = 0.018). Ourresults confirm an effect of acute stress on priming, and that this effect isrelated to SNS activity. In addition, they suggest a different relationshipbetween stress biomarkers and the different memory systems.
 How people judge something to be morally right or wrong is a fundamental questionof both the sciences and the humanities. Here we aim to identify the neuralprocesses that underlie the specific conclusion that something is morally wrong. To do this, we introduce a novel distinction between "moral deliberation," or theweighing of moral considerations, and the formation of a "moral verdict," or the commitment to one moral conclusion. We predict and identify hemodynamic activity in the bilateral anterior insula and basal ganglia that correlates withcommitting to the moral verdict "this is morally wrong" as opposed to "this ismorally not-wrong," a finding that is consistent with research from economicdecision-making. Using comparisons of deliberation-locked vs. verdict-lockedanalyses, we also demonstrate that hemodynamic activity in high-level corticalregions previously implicated in morality--including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and temporoparietal junction--correlatesprimarily with moral deliberation as opposed to moral verdicts. These findingsprovide new insights into what types of processes comprise the enterprise ofmoral judgment, and in doing so point to a framework for resolving why someclinical patients, including psychopaths, may have intact moral judgment butimpaired moral behavior.
 OBJECTIVE: Genetic and neurofunctional research in autism has highlighted theneed for improved characterization of the core social disorder defining the broadspectrum of syndrome manifestations. METHOD: This article reviews the advantages and limitations of current methods for the refinement and quantification of this highly heterogeneous social phenotype. RESULTS: The study of social visualpursuit by use of eye-tracking technology is offered as a paradigm for noveltools incorporating these requirements and as a research effort that builds onthe emerging synergy of different branches of social neuroscience. CONCLUSIONS:Advances in the area will require increased consideration of processes underlyingexperimental results and a closer approximation of experimental methods to thenaturalistic demands inherent in real-life social situations.
 One major goal in decision neuroscience is to investigate the neuronal mechanismsbeing responsible for the computation of product preferences. The aim of thepresent fMRI study was to investigate whether similar patterns of brain activity,reflecting category dependent and category independent preference signals, can beobserved in case of different food product categories (i.e. chocolate bars andsalty snacks). To that end we used a multivariate searchlight approach in which alinear support vector machine (l-SVM) was trained to distinguish preferred fromnon-preferred chocolate bars and subsequently tested its predictive power in caseof chocolate bars (within category prediction) and salty snacks (across category prediction). Preferences were measured by a binary forced choice decisionparadigm before the fMRI task. In the scanner, subjects saw only one product per trial which they had to rate after presentation. Consistent with previous multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) studies, we found category dependent preferencesignals in the ventral parts of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), but also indorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex(dlPFC). Category independent preference signals were observed in the dorsalparts of mPFC, dACC, and dlPFC. While the first two results have also beenreported in a closely related study, the activation in dlPFC is new in thiscontext. We propose that the dlPFC activity does not reflect the products' value computation per se, but rather a modulatory signal which is computed inanticipation of the forthcoming product rating after stimulus presentation.Furthermore we postulate that this kind of dlPFC activation emerges only if theanticipated choices fall into the domain of primary rewards, such as foods. Thus,in contrast to previous studies which investigated preference decoding forstimuli from utterly different categories, the present study revealed some fooddomain specific aspects of preference processing in the human brain.
 Differences in striatal dopamine (DA) function may be related to differences inthe degree of social attachment to others. Using positron emission tomography(PET), socially detached persons demonstrate reduced DA D2/3 receptor (D2/3R)availability in the striatum. However, previous PET studies have only usedantagonist radiotracers for D2/3R and have not specifically examined regions ofinterest (ROIs) such as the ventral striatum (VS). In 32 healthy persons, weinvestigated the relationship between self-reported attachment and DA D2/3Ravailability in striatal and extrastriatal ROIs as measured using the agonistradiotracer [11C]-(+)-PHNO. Surprisingly, more social attachment-as measured bythe attachment subscale of the temperament and character inventory-was related toless [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding in the VS (r(30) = -.43, p = .01). This relationship held in a subsample who also completed the detachment subscale of the Karolinska Scales of Personality (r(10) = .62, p = .03). However, no relationships wereobserved with BPND in the dorsal striatum or D3R-specific ROIs. One potentialexplanation for these findings is that persons who are more socially detachedhave less endogenous DA occupying D2/3R in the VS. This interpretation warrantsinvestigation by future research. These findings may help us better understandthe neurochemical basis of attachment.
 Empathy and sympathy play crucial roles in much of human social interaction andare necessary components for healthy coexistence. Sympathy is thought to be aproxy for motivating prosocial behavior and providing the affective andmotivational base for moral development. The purpose of the present study was to use functional MRI to characterize developmental changes in brain activation inthe neural circuits underpinning empathy and sympathy. Fifty-seven individuals,whose age ranged from 7 to 40 years old, were presented with short animatedvisual stimuli depicting painful and non-painful situations. These situationsinvolved either a person whose pain was accidentally caused or a person whosepain was intentionally inflicted by another individual to elicit empathic(feeling as the other) or sympathetic (feeling concern for the other) emotions,respectively. Results demonstrate monotonic age-related changes in the amygdala, supplementary motor area, and posterior insula when participants were exposed to painful situations that were accidentally caused. When participants observedpainful situations intentionally inflicted by another individual, age-relatedchanges were detected in the dorsolateral prefrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, with a gradual shift in that latter region from its medial to its lateralportion. This pattern of activation reflects a change from a visceral emotionalresponse critical for the analysis of the affective significance of stimuli to a more evaluative function. Further, these data provide evidence for partiallydistinct neural mechanisms subserving empathy and sympathy, and demonstrate theusefulness of a developmental neurobiological approach to the new emerging areaof moral neuroscience.
 For social omnivores such as rats and humans, taste is far more than a chemicalsense activated by food. By virtue of evolutionary and epigenetic elaboration,taste is associated with negative affect, stress vulnerability, responses topsychoactive substances, pain, and social judgment. A crucial gap in thisliterature, which spans behavior genetics, affective and social neuroscience, andembodied cognition, concerns links between taste and social behavior in rats.Here we show that rats selectively bred for low saccharin intake are subordinate to high-saccharin-consuming rats when they compete in weight-matched dyads forfood, a task used to model depression. Statistical and experimental controlssuggest that differential resource utilization within dyads is not an artifact ofindividual-level processes such as apparatus habituation or ingestive motivation.Tail skin temperature measurements showed that LoS rats display largerhyperthermic responses to social interaction after status is established,evidence linking taste, social stress, autonomic reactivity, and depression-like symptoms. Based on regression using early- and late-competition predictors topredict dyadic disparity in final competition scores, we tentatively suggest thatHiS rats emerge as dominant both because of an "early surge" on their part andbecause LoS acquiesce later. These findings should invigorate the comparativestudy of individual differences in social status and its relationship to mentaland physical health.
 The nature and underpinnings of infants' seemingly complex, third-party, socialevaluations remain highly contentious. Theoretical perspectives oscillate betweenrich and lean interpretations of the same expressed preferences. Although someargue that infants and toddlers possess a "moral sense" based on core knowledgeof the social world, others suggest that social evaluations are hierarchical innature and the product of an integration of rudimentary general processes such asattention allocation and approach and avoidance. Moreover, these biologicallyprepared minds interact in social environments that include significantvariation, which are likely to impact early social evaluations and behavior. The present study examined the neural underpinnings of and precursors to moralsensitivity in infants and toddlers (n = 73, ages 12-24 mo) through a series ofinterwoven measures, combining multiple levels of analysis includingelectrophysiological, eye-tracking, behavioral, and socioenvironmental.Continuous EEG and time-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) and gaze fixation were recorded while children watched characters engaging in prosocial andantisocial actions in two different tasks. All children demonstrated a neuraldifferentiation in both spectral EEG power density modulations and time-lockedERPs when perceiving prosocial or antisocial agents. Time-locked neuraldifferences predicted children's preference for prosocial characters and wereinfluenced by parental values regarding justice and fairness. Overall, thisinvestigation casts light on the fundamental nature of moral cognition, includingits underpinnings in general processes such as attention and approach-withdrawal,providing plausible mechanisms of early change and a foundation for forwardmovement in the field of developmental social neuroscience.
 In the present study, we used a valence classification task to investigate thecommon and distinct neural basis of the two fundamental dimensions of socialcognition (agency and communion) using functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI). The results showed that several brain areas associated with mentalizing, along with the inferior parietal gyrus in the mirror system, showed overlap inresponse to both agentic and communal words. These findings suggest that bothcontent categories are related to the neural basis of social cognition; further, several areas in the default mode network (DMN) showed similar deactivationsbetween agency and communion, reflecting task-induced deactivation (TID). Interms of distinct activations, the findings indicated greater deactivations forcommunal than agentic content in the ventral anterior cingulate (vACC) and medialorbitofrontal cortex (mOFC). Communion also showed greater activation in somevisual areas compared to agentic content, including occipital gyrus, lingualgyrus, and fusiform gyrus. These activations may reflect greater allocation ofattentional resources to visual areas when processing communal content, orinhibition of cognitive activity irrelevant to task performance. If so, thissuggests greater attention and engagement with communion-related content. Thepresent research thus suggests common and differential activations for agency-versus communion-related content.
 Multiple disorders once jointly conceived as 'nervous diseases' became segregatedby the distinct institutional traditions forged in neurology and psychiatry. As aresult, each field specialized in the study and treatment of a subset of suchconditions. Here we propose new avenues for interdisciplinary interaction througha triangulation of both fields with social neuroscience. To this end, we reviewevidence from five relevant domains (facial emotion recognition, empathy, theory of mind, moral cognition, social context assessment), highlighting their commondisturbances across neurological and psychiatric conditions and discussing their multiple pathophysiological mechanisms. Our proposal is anchored inmultidimensional evidence, including behavioral, neurocognitive, and geneticfindings. From a clinical perspective, this work paves the way for dimensionaland transdiagnostic approaches, new pharmacological treatments, and educationalinnovations rooted in a combined neuropsychiatric training. Research-wise, itfosters new models of the social brain and a novel platform to explore theinterplay of cognitive and social functions. Finally, we identify new challenges for this synergistic framework.
 This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neuralsubstrates of empathy, Theory of Mind (ToM), and self-other differentiationinvolved in the adaptive understanding of people's internal states. Threeconditions were distinguished in both sad and neutral (no obvious emotion)contexts. The empathy condition involved imagining what another person is feelingwhile the more cognitively loaded ToM condition involved imagining what wouldmake another person feel better. The self-reference condition requiredparticipants to imagine how they would feel in someone else's situation. Areaspreviously implicated in empathy, ToM, and self-other differentiation wereidentified within the different conditions, regardless of emotional context.Specifically, the frontal and temporal poles responded more strongly for ToM thanfor empathy. The self-reference condition was associated with strongerdorsolateral prefrontal response than the empathy condition, while the reversecomparison revealed a stronger role for right frontal pole. Activations infrontal pole and orbitofrontal cortex were shared between the three conditions.Contrasts of parameter estimates demonstrated modulation by emotional context.The findings of common and differential patterns of responding observed inprefrontal and temporal regions suggest that within the social cognition network empathy, ToM and self-other differentiation have distinct roles that areresponsive to context.
 Emotional instability, difficulties in social adjustment, and disinhibitedbehavior are the most common symptoms of the psychiatric comorbidities injuvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). This psychopathology has been associated with dysfunctions of mesial-frontal brain circuits. The present work is a first directtest of this link and adapted a paradigm for probing frontal circuits duringempathy for pain. Neural and psychophysiological parameters of pain empathy were assessed by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) withsimultaneous pupillometry in 15 JME patients and 15 matched healthy controls. In JME patients, we observed reduced neural activation of the anterior cingulatecortex (ACC), the anterior insula (AI), and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex(VLPFC). This modulation was paralleled by reduced pupil dilation during empathy for pain in patients. At the same time, pupil dilation was positively related to neural activity of the ACC, AI, and VLPFC. In JME patients, the ACC additionally showed reduced functional connectivity with the primary and secondarysomatosensory cortex, areas fundamentally implicated in processing the somaticcause of another's pain. Our results provide first evidence that alterations ofmesial-frontal circuits directly affect psychosocial functioning in JME patients and draw a link of pupil dynamics with brain activity during emotionalprocessing. The findings of reduced pain empathy related activation of the ACCand AI and aberrant functional integration of the ACC with somatosensory cortexareas provide further evidence for this network's role in social behavior andhelps explaining the JME psychopathology and patients' difficulties in socialadjustment.
 Current models in social neuroscience advance that eye contact may automatically recruit cognitive resources. Here, we directly tested this hypothesis byevaluating the distracting strength of eye contact on concurrent visualprocessing in the well-known Stroop's paradigm. As expected, participants showed stronger Stroop interference under concomitant eye contact as compared to closed eyes. Two control experiments allowed ruling out low-level account of this effectas well as non-specific effect of the presence of open eyes. This suggests thatrefraining from processing eye contact is actually as difficult as refrainingfrom word reading in the Stroop task. Crucially, the eye contact effect wasobtained while gaze was not under the direct focus of attention and theparticipants were faced with another powerful distracter (the incongruent word)in the task at hand. Thus, there is a cost of being watched even in circumstanceswhere the processing of direct gaze is strongly disfavored. The present resultsemphasize the crucial status of eye contact in human cognition.
 Social neuroscience is a flourishing, interdisciplinary field that investigatesthe underlying biological processes of social cognition and behaviour. The recentapplication of social neuroscience to psychiatric research advances ourunderstanding of various psychiatric illnesses that are characterized byimpairments in social cognition and social functioning. In addition, the upcomingline of social neuroscience research provides new techniques to design andevaluate treatment interventions that are aimed at improving patients' sociallives. This review provides a contemporary overview of social neuroscience inpsychiatry. We draw together the major findings about the neural mechanisms ofsocial cognitive processes directed at understanding others and socialinteractions in psychiatric illnesses and discuss their implications for futureresearch and clinical practice.
 Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic condition characterized by a hypersocialpersonality and desire to form close relationships, juxtaposed with significantanxieties of nonsocial events. The neural underpinnings of anxiety in individualswith WS are currently unknown. Aberrations in the anatomical and microstructural integrity of the uncinate fasciculus (UF) have been recently implicated in socialand generalized anxiety disorders. Based on these findings, we tested thehypothesis that the reported anxieties in individuals with WS share similarneuropathological correlates. Toward this end, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)methods were employed to examine the microstructural integrity (fractionalanisotropy, mean diffusivity, longitudinal diffusivity) of the UF in 18 WS and 15typically developing adults (TD). Anxiety and sociability questionnaires wereadministered to determine associations with DTI indices of UF across groups.Results revealed comparable white matter integrity of the UF across groups, yetelevated subjective experience of anxiety in those with WS. Additionally,sociability and UF microstructural properties were dissociated across bothgroups. Whereas no relationships were found between DTI indices and anxiety in TDparticipants, strong negative associations were observed between these constructsin individuals with WS. Findings indicated that increased anxiety manifested byindividuals with WS was associated with DTI measures of the UF and may signalstructural or possibly physiological aberration involving this tract within theprefrontal-temporal network.
 Infant faces are highly salient social stimuli that appear to elicit intuitiveparenting behaviors in healthy adult women. Behavioral and observational studies indicate that this effect may be modulated by experiences of reproduction,caregiving, and psychiatric symptomatology that affect normative attention andreward processing of infant cues. However, relatively little is known about theneural correlates of these effects. Using the event-related potential (ERP)technique, this study investigated the impact of parental status (mother,non-mother) and depression symptoms on early visual processing of infant faces ina community sample of adult women. Specifically, the P1 and N170 ERP componentselicited in response to infant face stimuli were examined. While characteristics of the N170 were not modulated by parental status, a statistically significantpositive correlation was observed between depression symptom severity and N170amplitude. This relationship was not observed for the P1. These results suggestthat depression symptoms may modulate early neurophysiological responsiveness to infant cues, even at sub-clinical levels.
 Despite the ubiquity of endogenous emotions and their role in both resilience andpathology, the processes supporting their generation are largely unknown. Wepropose a neural component process model of endogenous generation of emotion(EGE) and test it in two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments(N = 32/293) where participants generated and regulated positive and negativeemotions based on internal representations, usin self-chosen generation methods. EGE activated nodes of salience (SN), default mode (DMN) and frontoparietalcontrol (FPCN) networks. Component processes implemented by these networks wereestablished by investigating their functional associations, activation dynamicsand integration. SN activation correlated with subjective affect, with midbrainnodes exclusively distinguishing between positive and negative affect intensity, showing dynamics consistent generation of core affect. Dorsomedial DMN, together with ventral anterior insula, formed a pathway supporting multiple generationmethods, with activation dynamics suggesting it is involved in the generation of elaborated experiential representations. SN and DMN both coupled to left frontal FPCN which in turn was associated with both subjective affect and representation formation, consistent with FPCN supporting the executive coordination of thegeneration process. These results provide a foundation for research intoendogenous emotion in normal, pathological and optimal function.
 Mammals have developed patterns of social relationships that enhance the survivalof individuals and maximize the reproductive success of species. Although social stimuli and social responses are highly complex, recent studies are providingsubstantial insights into their neural substrates. Neural pathways employing the nonapeptides vasopressin and oxytocin play a particularly prominent role both in social recognition and the expression of appropriate social responses. Newinsights into social neuroscience are discussed, along with the relevance of thisrapidly developing field to human relationships and disease processes.
 BACKGROUND: Theory of mind (ToM) functioning develops during certain phases ofchildhood. Factors such as language development and educational style seem toinfluence its development. Some studies that have focused on transculturalaspects of ToM development have found differences between Asian and Westerncultures. To date, however, little is known about transcultural differences inneural activation patterns as they relate to ToM functioning. EXPERIMENTALMETHODS: The aim of our study was to observe ToM functioning and differences inbrain activation patterns, as assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI). This study included a sample of 18 healthy Japanese and 15 healthyCaucasian subjects living in Japan. We presented a ToM task depicting geometricalshapes moving in social patterns. We also administered questionnaires to examine empathy abilities and cultural background factors. RESULTS: Behavioral datashowed no significant group differences in the subjects' post-scan descriptionsof the movies. The imaging results displayed stronger activation in the medialprefrontal cortex (MPFC) in the Caucasian sample during the presentation of ToMvideos. Furthermore, the task-associated activation of the MPFC was positivelycorrelated with autistic and alexithymic features in the Japanese sample.DISCUSSION: In summary, our results showed evidence of culturally dependentsociobehavioral trait patterns, which suggests that they have an impact on brain activation patterns during information processing involving ToM.
 Available evidence suggests that infants use adults' social cues for learning by the second half of the first year of life. However, little is known about theshort-term or long-term effects of joint attention interactions on learning andmemory in younger infants. In the present study, 4-month-old infants werefamiliarized with visually presented objects in either of two conditions thatdiffered in the degree of joint attention (high vs. low). Brain activity inresponse to familiar and novel objects was assessed immediately after thefamiliarization phase (immediate recognition), and following a 1-week delay(delayed recognition). The latency of the Nc component differentiated betweenrecognition of old versus new objects. Pb amplitude and latency were affected by joint attention in delayed recognition. Moreover, the frequency of infant gaze tothe experimenter during familiarization differed between the two experimentalgroups and modulated the Pb response. Results show that joint attention affectsthe mechanisms of long-term retention in 4-month-old infants. We conclude thatjoint attention helps children at this young age to recognize the relevance oflearned items.
 The current functional magnetic resonance imaging study examines brain activityduring the perception of infant and adult tears. Infant tears evoke strongerresponses in the visual cortex than adult tears, indicating that infant tears arehighly salient. In addition, our study shows that infant tears uniquely activate somatosensory pain regions, which could stimulate actions directed at theelimination of the source of pain. Shedding tears may be a strong means to elicitthe parent's sharing of the infant's feelings, thereby strengtheningcaregiver-infant bonding and securing infant survival.
 Basic epilepsy teachings assert that seizures arise from the cerebral cortex,glossing over infratentorial structures such as the cerebellum that are believed to modulate rather than generate seizures. Nonetheless, ataxia and other clinicalfindings in epileptic patients are slowly but inevitably drawing attention tothis neural node. Tracing the evolution of this line of inquiry from the observedcoincidence of cerebellar atrophy and cerebellar dysfunction (most apparentlymanifested as ataxia) in epilepsy to their close association, this reviewconsiders converging clinical, physiological, histological, and neuroimagingevidence that support incorporating the cerebellum into epilepsy pathology. Weexamine reports of still controversial cerebellar epilepsy, studies of cerebellarstimulation alleviating paroxysmal epileptic activity, studies and case reportsof cerebellar lesions directly associated with seizures, and conditions in which ataxia is accompanied by epileptic seizures. Finally, the review substantiatesthe role of this complex brain structure in epilepsy whether by coincidence, as aconsequence of deleterious cortical epileptic activity or antiepileptic drugs, orthe very cause of the disease.
 Most studies investigating emotion recognition in schizophrenia have focused onfacial expressions and neglected bodily and vocal expressions. Furthermore,little is known about affective multisensory integration in schizophrenia. In thefirst experiment, the authors investigated recognition of static, face-blurred,whole-body expressions (instrumental, angry, fearful, and sad) with atwo-alternative, forced-choice, simultaneous matching task in a sample ofschizophrenia patients, nonschizophrenic psychotic patients, and matchedcontrols. In the second experiment, dynamic, face-blurred, whole-body expressions(fearful and happy) were presented simultaneously with either congruent orincongruent human or animal vocalizations to schizophrenia patients and controls.Participants were instructed to categorize the emotion expressed by the body and to ignore the auditory information. The results of Experiment 1 show an emotionrecognition impairment in the schizophrenia group and to a lesser extent in thenonschizophrenic psychosis group, and this for all four expressions. The findingsof Experiment 2 show that schizophrenia patients are more influenced by theauditory information than controls, but only when the auditory informationconsists of human vocalizations. This shows that schizophrenia patients areimpaired in recognizing whole-body expressions, and they show abnormal affective multisensory integration of bimodal stimuli originating from the same source.
 Group level statistical maps of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals acquired using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have become a basicmeasurement for much of systems, cognitive and social neuroscience. A challengein making inferences from these statistical maps is the noise and potentialconfounds that arise from the head motion that occurs within and betweenacquisition volumes. This motion results in the scan plane being misalignedduring acquisition, ultimately leading to reduced statistical power when maps areconstructed at the group level. In most cases, an attempt is made to correct for this motion through the use of retrospective analysis methods. In this paper, we use a prospective active marker motion correction (PRAMMO) system that uses radiofrequency markers for real-time tracking of motion, enabling on-line slice plane correction. We show that the statistical power of the activation maps issubstantially increased using PRAMMO compared to conventional retrospectivecorrection. Analysis of our results indicates that the PRAMMO acquisition reducesthe variance without decreasing the signal component of the BOLD (beta). UsingPRAMMO could thus improve the overall statistical power of fMRI based BOLDmeasurements, leading to stronger inferences of the nature of processing in thehuman brain.
 Recent evidence confirms that emotion can trigger executive attentional control. Participants resolve conflict faster when encountering emotionally negative orpositive stimuli. This effect is accompanied by an enlarged conflict negativityin event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and activation of the ventral anteriorcingulate cortex (ACC) in fMRI. Here, we tested whether temperament (the traiteffortful control) and subclinical factors (anxiety, depression) can influencethe emotional modulation of executive attention. These factors correlated withconflict processing in six experiments that utilized different conflict tasks(flanker, Simon) and different types of emotional stimuli (visual, auditory).Participants high in effortful control and low in anxiety and depressionresponded faster to conflict processing in emotional stimuli, showed an enhanced ERP conflict negativity, and additional activation in the ventral ACC. The datashow that temperamental effortful control, depression, and anxiety are related tothe influence of emotion on executive attention and its underlying neuralcorrelates.
 A vast amount of research has suggested that subjects with substance use disorder(SUD) might have difficulty making advantageous decisions that opt in favor of a longer-term, larger reward than an immediate, smaller reward. The currentresearch explored the impact of reward bias and cortical frontal asymmetry (left lateralization effect) in SUD in response to a decisional task (Iowa GamblingTask). Fifty SUD participants and 40 controls (CG) were tested using the IowaGambling Task. Electrophysiology (electroencephalography) recording was performedduring task execution. We measured left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex power activity. Behavioral responses (gain/loss options); frequency bandmodulation (asymmetry index) for delta, theta, alpha, and beta band; and corticalsource localization (standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetictomography) were considered. The SUD group opted in favor of the immediate rewardoption (loss) more frequently than the long-term option (gain) when compared tothe CG. Secondly, SUD showed increased left-hemisphere activation in response to losing (with immediate reward) choices in comparison with the CG. The lefthemispheric unbalance effect and the "reward bias" were adduced to explain thedecisional impairment in SUD.
 We describe the service-for-prestige theory of leadership, which proposes thatvoluntary leader-follower relations evolved in humans via a process of reciprocalexchange that generated adaptive benefits for both leaders and followers. Wepropose that although leader-follower relations first emerged in the humanlineage to solve problems related to information sharing and social coordination,they ultimately evolved into exchange relationships whereby followers couldcompensate leaders for services which would otherwise have been prohibitivelycostly for leaders to provide. In this exchange, leaders incur costs to providefollowers with public goods, and in return, followers incur costs to provideleaders with prestige (and associated fitness benefits). Because whole groups of followers tend to gain from leader-provided public goods, and because prestige iscostly for followers to produce, the provisioning of prestige to leaders requiressolutions to the "free rider" problem of disrespectful followers (who benefitfrom leader services without sharing the costs of producing prestige). Thusservice-for-prestige makes the unique prediction that disrespectful followers of beneficial leaders will be targeted by other followers for punitive sentimentand/or social exclusion. Leader-follower relations should be more reciprocal and mutually beneficial when leaders and followers have more equal social bargaining power. However, as leaders gain more relative power, and their high statusbecomes less dependent on their willingness to pay the costs of benefittingfollowers, service-for-prestige predicts that leader-follower relations willbecome based more on leaders' ability to dominate and exploit rather than benefitfollowers. We review evidential support for a set of predictions made byservice-for-prestige, and discuss how service-for-prestige relates to socialneuroscience research on leadership.
 It has been proposed that common codes for vision and action emerge fromassociations between an individual's production and simultaneous observation ofactions. This typically first-person view of one's own action subsequentlytransfers to the third-person view when observing another individual. We testedvision-action associations and the transfer from first-person to third-personperspective by comparing novel hand-action sequences that were learned underthree conditions: first, by being performed and simultaneously viewed from afirst-person perspective; second, by being performed but not seen; and third, by being seen from a first-person view without being executed. We then usedfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the response to thesethree types of learned action sequences when they were presented from athird-person perspective. Visuomotor areas responded most strongly to sequencesthat were learned by simultaneously producing and observing the action sequences.We also note an important asymmetry between vision and action: Action sequenceslearned by performance alone, in the absence of vision, facilitated the emergenceof visuomotor responses, whereas action sequences learned by viewing alone hadcomparably little effect. This dominance of action over vision supports thenotion of forward/predictive models of visuomotor systems.
 Surface-level differences in the reward and punishment variants, specificallygreater long-term decision making in the punishment variant of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) observed in previous studies led to the present comparison oflong-term decision making in the two IGT variants (n = 320, male = 160). It wascontended that risk aversion triggered by a positive frame of the reward variant and risk seeking triggered by a negative frame of the punishment variant appears as long-term decision making in the two IGT variants. Apart from the frame of thevariant as a within-subjects factor (variant type: reward and punishment), theorder in which the frame was triggered (order type: reward-punishment orpunishment-reward), and the four types of instructions that delineated motivationtoward reward from that of punishment (reward, punishment, reward and punishment,and no-hint) were hypothesized to have an effect on foresighted decision makingin the IGT. As expected, long-term decision making differed across the two IGTvariants suggesting that the frame of the variant has an effect on long-termdecision making in the IGT (p < 0.001). The order in which a variant waspresented, and the type of the instructions that were used both had an effect on long-term decision making in the two IGT variants (p < 0.05). A post hoc testsuggested that the instructions that differentiated between reward and punishmentresulted in greater foresight than the commonly used IGT instructions that failto distinguish between reward and punishment. As observed in previous studies,there were more number of participants (60%) who showed greater foresight in the punishment variant than in the reward variant (p < 0.001). The results suggestthat foresight in IGT decision making is sensitive to reward and punishment framein an asymmetric manner, an observation that is aligned with the behavioraldecision making framework. Benefits of integrating findings from behavioralstudies in decision neuroscience are discussed, and a need to investigatecultural differences in the IGT studies is pointed out.
 Both emotional images and human faces are particularly salient compared to other categories of visual stimuli. The late positive potential (LPP) is larger foremotional than neutral images, and some evidence suggests that the LPP is furtherenhanced for images containing people. Studies of emotion frequently comparepleasant and unpleasant IAPS pictures to neutral, without an explicitunderstanding of how the presence of faces in these images may affect attentionalallocation and psychophysiological response. The present experiment examined the effect of faces on the LPP elicited by neutral and threatening IAPS images. TheLPP was enhanced by faces in neutral images, but no difference was observedbetween threatening images with and without faces. These results demonstrate thatthe inclusion of faces in IAPS images significantly impacts the LPP; however,this effect is unique to neutral images.
 In spite of considerable progress in the understanding of the neural mechanismsunderlying the experience of empathy, the majority of previous investigationshave focused on how we share negative affective states (and in particular pain)of others, whereas only few studies have targeted empathy for positive emotions. This bias has precluded addressing one of the central tenets of the sharedrepresentations account of empathy, which is that different networks should beengaged when empathizing with emotions that are represented on different neurallevels. The aim of the present study was to overcome this limitation and to test whether empathy for pleasant and unpleasant affective touch is underpinned bydifferent neural networks. To this end we used functional magnetic resonanceimaging (fMRI), with two independent replication experiments (N = 18, N = 32),and a novel paradigm enabling the joint investigation of first-hand and vicariousresponses to pleasant and unpleasant affect induced via visuo-tactilestimulation. This revealed that empathy is subserved by distinct neural networks,with those regions recruited in the first-hand experience of positive or negativeaffective states also being specifically recruited when empathizing with theserespective states in others. More specifically, the first-hand and vicariousexperience of pleasant touch commonly recruited medial orbitofrontal cortex(OFC), while unpleasant touch was associated with shared activation in the right fronto-insular cortex. The observation that specifically tailored subsystems ofthe human brain are engaged to share positive versus negative touch of othersbrings fresh evidence to one of the major goals of the social neuroscience ofempathy: to identify which specific aspects of the affective states of others areshared, and what role this plays in enabling the understanding of the emotions ofothers.
 BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with behavioral andneurobiological evidences of negative bias in unconscious emotional processing.However, little is known about the time course of this deficit. The current studyaimed to explore the unconscious processing of emotional facial expressions inMDD patients by means of event-related potentials (ERPs). METHODS: The ERPresponses to subliminally presented happy/neutral/sad faces were recorded in 26medication-free patients and 26 healthy controls in a backward masking task.Three ERP components were compared between patients and controls. RESULTS:Detection accuracy was at chance level for both groups, suggesting that theprocess was performed in the absence of conscious awareness of the emotionalstimuli. Robust emotionxgroup interactions were observed in P1, N170 and P3.Compared with the neutral faces, 1) the patients showed larger P1 for sad andsmaller P1 for happy faces; however, the controls showed a completely inverse P1 pattern; 2) the controls exhibited larger N170 in the happy but not in the sadtrials, whereas patients had comparable larger N170 amplitudes in sad and happytrials; 3) although both groups exhibited larger P3 for emotional faces, thepatients showed a priority for sad trials while the controls showed a priorityfor happy trials. CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that negative processing biasexists on the unconscious level in individuals with MDD. The ERP measuresindicated that the unconscious emotional processing in MDD patients has a timecourse of three-stage deflection.
 Social acceptance is of key importance for healthy functioning. We usedfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine age-related changes inthe neural correlates of social acceptance and rejection processing. Participantsfrom four age groups participated in the study: pre-pubertal children (8-10years), early adolescents (12-14 years), older adolescents (16-17 years) andyoung adults (19-25 years). During the experiment, participants were presentedwith unfamiliar faces of peers and were asked to predict whether they expected tobe liked or disliked by the other person, followed by feedback indicatingacceptance or rejection. Results showed that activation in the ventral mPFC andstriatum to social feedback was context-dependent; there was increased activationwhen participants had positive expectations about social evaluation, andincreased activation following social acceptance feedback. Age-relatedcomparisons revealed a linear increase in activity with age in these brainregions for positive expectations of social evaluation. Similarly, a linearincrease with age was found for activation in the striatum, ventral mPFC, OFC,and lateral PFC for rejection feedback. No age-related differences in neuralactivation were shown for social acceptance feedback. Together, these resultsprovide important insights in the developmental trajectories of brain regionsimplicated in social and affective behavior.
 Recent Social Intuitionist work suggests that moral judgments are intuitive (not based on conscious deliberation or any significant chain of inference), and that the reasons we produce to explain or justify our judgments and actions are forthe most part post hoc rationalizations rather than the actual source of thosejudgments. This is consistent with work on judgment and explanation in otherdomains, and it correctly challenges one-sidedly rationalistic accounts. Wesuggest that in fact reasoning has a great deal of influence on moral judgmentsand on intuitive judgments in general. This influence is not apparent from study of judgments simply in their immediate context, but it is crucial for thequestion of how cognition can help us avoid deleterious effects and enhancepotentially beneficial effects of affect on judgment, action, and cognitionitself. We begin with established work on several reactive strategies forcognitive control of affect (e.g., suppression, reappraisal), then give specialattention to more complex sorts of conflict ("extended deliberation") involvingmultiple interacting factors, both affective and reflective. These situations areespecially difficult to study in a controlled way, but we propose some possibleexperimental approaches. We then review proactive strategies for control,including avoidance of temptation and mindfulness meditation (Froeliger et al.,2012, this issue). We give special attention to the role of slow or "cool"cognitive processes (e.g., deliberation, planning, and executive control) in the inculcation of long-term dispositions, traits, intuitions, skills, or habits. Thelatter are critical because they in turn give rise to a great many of our fast,intuitive judgments. The reasoning processes involved here are distinct from posthoc rationalizations and have a very real impact on countless intuitive judgmentsin concrete situations. This calls for a substantial enlargement of research oncognitive control, drawing on work in developmental psychology, automatization,educational theory, and other fields.
 Facial expressions are a potent source of information about how others evaluateour behavior. In the present study, we investigated how the internalperformance-monitoring system, as reflected by error-related negativity (ERN), isaffected by external cues of positive (happy faces) or negative evaluation(disgusted faces) of performance. We hypothesized that if the social contextindeed impacts on how we evaluate our own performance, we would expect that thesame performance error would result in larger ERN amplitudes in the context ofnegative evaluation than in a positive evaluation context. Our findings confirmour predictions: ERN amplitudes were largest when stimuli consisted of disgusted faces, compared to when stimuli consisted of happy faces. Importantly, ERNamplitudes in our control condition, in which sad faces were used as stimuli,were no different from the positive evaluation condition, ruling out thepossibility that effects in the negative evaluation condition resulted fromnegative affect per se. We suggest that external social cues of approval ordisapproval impact on how we evaluate our own performance at a very basic level: The brain processes errors that are associated with social disapproval as moremotivationally salient, signaling the need for additional cognitive resources to prevent subsequent failures.
 The judgement of personality change following acquired brain injury (ABI) is apowerful subjective and social action, and has been shown to be associated with arange of serious psychosocial consequences. Traditional conceptualisations ofpersonality change (e.g., Lishman, 1998) have largely derived from individualist concepts of personality (e.g., Eysenck, 1967). These assume a direct link betweenneurological damage and altered personhood, accounting predominantly for theirjudgements of change. This assumption is found as commonly in family accounts of change as in professional discourse. Recent studies and perspectives from theoverlapping fields of social neuroscience, cognitive approaches to self andidentity and psychosocial processes following ABI mount a serious challenge tothis assumption. These collectively identify a range of direct and indirectfactors that may influence the judgement or felt sense of change in personhood bysurvivors of ABI and their significant others. These perspectives are reviewedwithin a biopsychosocial framework: neurological and neuropsychological deficits,psychological mechanisms and psychosocial processes. Importantly, theseperspectives are applied to generate a range of clinical interventions that were not identifiable within traditional conceptualisations of personality changesfollowing ABI.
 Recent evidence indicates that empathic responses to others' pain are modulatedby various situational and individual factors. However, few studies have examinedhow empathy and underlying brain functions are modulated by social hierarchies,which permeate human society with an enormous impact on social behavior andcognition. In this study, social hierarchies were established based on incidentalskill in a perceptual task in which all participants were mediumly ranked.Afterwards, participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while watching inferior-status or superior-status targets receiving painful ornon-painful stimulation. The results revealed that painful stimulation applied toinferior-status targets induced higher activations in the anterior insula (AI)and anterior medial cingulate cortex (aMCC), whereas these empathic brainactivations were significantly attenuated in response to superior-status targets'pain. Further, this neural empathic bias to inferior-status targets wasaccompanied by stronger functional couplings of AI with brain regions importantin emotional processing (i.e. thalamus) and cognitive control (i.e. middlefrontal gyrus). Our findings indicate that emotional sharing with others' pain isshaped by relative positions in a social hierarchy such that underlying empathic neural responses are biased toward inferior-status compared with superior-status individuals.
 Human communication has been described as involving the coding-decoding of aconventional symbol system, which could be supported by parts of the human motor system (i.e. the "mirror neurons system"). However, this view does not explainhow these conventions could develop in the first place. Here we target theneglected but crucial issue of how people organize their non-verbal behavior tocommunicate a given intention without pre-established conventions. We havemeasured behavioral and brain responses in pairs of subjects during communicativeexchanges occurring in a real, interactive, on-line social context. In two fMRIstudies, we found robust evidence that planning new communicative actions (by asender) and recognizing the communicative intention of the same actions (by areceiver) relied on spatially overlapping portions of their brains (the rightposterior superior temporal sulcus). The response of this region was lateralized to the right hemisphere, modulated by the ambiguity in meaning of thecommunicative acts, but not by their sensorimotor complexity. These resultsindicate that the sender of a communicative signal uses his own intentionrecognition system to make a prediction of the intention recognition performed bythe receiver. This finding supports the notion that our communicative abilitiesare distinct from both sensorimotor processes and language abilities.
 Neuroimaging allows to estimate brain activity when individuals are doingsomething. The location and intensity of this estimated activity providesinformation on the dynamics and processes that guide choice behaviour andassociated actions that should be considered a complement to behavioural studies.Decision neuroscience therefore sheds new light on whether the brain evaluatesand compares alternatives when decisions are made, or if other processes are atstake. This work helped to demonstrate that the situations faced by individuals(risky, uncertain, delayed in time) do not all have the same (behavioural)complexity, and are not underlined by activity in the cerebral networks. Takinginto account brain dynamics of people (suffering from obesity or not) when makingfood consumption decisions might allow for improved strategies in public healthprevention, far from the rational choice theory promoted by neoclassicaleconomics.
 Emotion regulation is a crucial skill in adulthood; its acquisition representsone of the key developmental tasks in early childhood. Difficulties with adaptiveemotion regulation increase the risk of psychopathology in childhood andadulthood. This is, for instance, shown by a relation between emotion regulation and aggressive behavior in childhood age, indicating emotion dysregulation as an important risk factor of aggressive behavior and potential precursor ofpsychopathology. Based on (1) interrelations between emotion processes and socialinformation processing (maladaptive emotion regulation and social informationprocessing are associated with higher levels of aggression) and (2) recentneuroscientific findings showing that empathy deficits might not only result indifficulties labeling others' emotions but one's own emotions too, we suggestthat empathy deficits might serve as potential trigger of emotion dysregulation. Different studies investigating the relation between empathy and emotionregulation are presented and discussed. Discussions are based on the assumedpotential of empathy deficits triggering emotion dysregulation. Furthermore,developmental neuroscientific findings on empathy and emotion regulation arehighlighted which provide further insights on how these processes might relate.Finally, possible directions for future research are presented.
 Acting together with others is a fundamental human ability. This raises thepossibility that we take others' actions into account whenever somebody actsaround us. Event-related fMRI was used to identify brain regions responsive tochanges in cognitive processing when one and the same go-nogo task is performedalone or together with a co-actor performing a complementary task. Reaction timesshowed that participants integrated the potential action of their co-actor intheir own action planning. Increased activation in ventral premotor cortex wasfound when participants acted upon stimuli referring to their own actionalternative, but only when their partner performed a complementary task. Thissuggests that knowing about the potential actions of a partner increases therelevance of stimuli referring to oneself. Acting in the presence of a co-actorwas also associated with increased orbitofrontal activation, indicating thatparticipants monitored their performance more closely to make sure it really was their turn. These results suggest that our default mode is to interact withothers.
 Prior research has suggested that loneliness is associated with an implicithypervigilance to social threats-an assumption in line with the evolutionarymodel of loneliness that indicates feeling socially isolated (or on the socialperimeter) leads to increased attention and surveillance of the social world and an unwitting focus on self-preservation. Little is known, however, about thetemporal dynamics for social threat (vs. nonsocial threat) in the lonely brains. We used high-density electrical neuroimaging and a behavioral task includingsocial and nonsocial threat (and neutral) pictures to investigate the braindynamics of implicit processing for social threat vs. nonsocial threat stimuli inlonely participants (N = 10), compared to nonlonely individuals (N = 9). Thepresent study provides evidence that social threat images are differentiated fromnonsocial threat stimuli more quickly in the lonely (~116 ms after stimulusonset) than nonlonely (~252 ms after stimulus onset) brains. That speed of threatprocessing in lonely individuals is in accord with the evolutionary model ofloneliness. Brain source estimates expanded these results by suggesting thatlonely (but not nonlonely) individuals showed early recruitment of brain areasinvolved in attention and self-representation.
 This study investigated the attention modulation of disgust in comparison withanger in a dot-probe task. Results indicated a two-stage processing of attention modulation by threats. When participants viewed the cues that were represented byChinese faces (i.e. the in-group condition), it was found at the early processingstage that an angry face elicited a larger occipital P1 component whereas adisgusted face elicited a smaller P1 for validly than for invalidly cued targets.However, the result pattern was reversed at the later processing stage: the P3amplitudes were larger for valid disgust cues but were smaller for valid angrycues, when both were compared with invalid cue conditions. In addition, whenparticipants viewed the cues that were represented by foreign faces (i.e. theout-group condition), the attention modulation of disgust/anger diminished at theearly stage, whereas enhanced P3 amplitudes were observed in response to validly cued targets in both disgusting and angry conditions at the later stage. Thecurrent result implied that although people can perceptually differentiate theemotional categories of out-group faces as accurately as in-group faces, they maystill be not able to psychologically understand the subtle differences behinddifferent categories of out-group facial expressions.
 Healthy adults have robust individual differences in neuroanatomy and cognitiveability not captured by demographics or gross morphology (Luders, Narr, Thompson,& Toga, 2009). We used a hierarchical independent component analysis (hICA) tocreate novel characterizations of individual differences in our participants(N=190). These components fused data across multiple cognitive tests andneuroanatomical variables. The first level contained four independent, underlyingsources of phenotypic variance that predominately modeled broad relationshipswithin types of data (e.g., "white matter," or "subcortical gray matter"), butwere not reflective of traditional individual difference measures such as sex,age, or intracranial volume. After accounting for the novel individual differencemeasures, a second level analysis identified two underlying sources of phenotypicvariation. One of these made strong, joint contributions to both the anatomicalstructures associated with the core fronto-parietal "rich club" network (van den Heuvel & Sporns, 2011), and to cognitive factors. These findings suggest that ahierarchical, data-driven approach is able to identify underlying sources ofindividual difference that contribute to cognitive-anatomical variation inhealthy young adults.
 The present research explored the effect of cross-modal integration of emotional cues (auditory and visual (AV)) compared with only visual (V) emotional cues inobserving interspecies interactions. The brain activity was monitored whensubjects processed AV and V situations, which represented an emotional (positive or negative), interspecies (human-animal) interaction. Congruence (emotionallycongruous or incongruous visual and auditory patterns) was also modulated.electroencephalography brain oscillations (from delta to beta) were analyzed and the cortical source localization (by standardized Low Resolution BrainElectromagnetic Tomography) was applied to the data. Frequency band (mainlylow-frequency delta and theta) showed a significant brain activity increasing in response to negative compared to positive interactions within the righthemisphere. Moreover, differences were found based on stimulation type, with anincreased effect for AV compared with V. Finally, delta band supported alateralized right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity in response to negative and incongruous interspecies interactions, mainly for AV. Thecontribution of cross-modality, congruence (incongruous patterns), andlateralization (right DLPFC) in response to interspecies emotional interactionswas discussed at light of a "negative lateralized effect."
 UNLABELLED: Recent developments in clinical, cognitive, and behavioral sciencesas well as in social neuroscience can provide new perspectives on ourunderstanding of different forms of pain expression and the social reactions ofobservers to various types of pain expression. Studies indicate that painexpression is governed by both automatic (unintentional, reflexive) andcontrolled (intentional, purposive) neuroregulatory systems. Reciprocalmechanisms in observers responsible for automatic (unintentional, reflexive) and controlled (intentional, reflective) reactions also are important. Observersappear more likely to display immediate "visceral" emotional reactions tounintentional, reflexive expression, whereas controlled expression characterized by purposive behavior appears more likely to elicit reflection on the nature and origins of the person's pain. This review summarizes research within the context of a theoretical model for understanding how pain is perceived in others.PERSPECTIVE: People attempting to understand another person's pain may haveaccess to the person's spontaneous behavioral reaction as well as verbal reportand other purposive communications. The former instigates reflexive and emotionalreactions, whereas the latter tends to be perceived as confounding expression of experience with response to situational demands.
 Social cognition consists of multiple interpersonal abilities such as emotionalfacial recognition, the "theory of mind", and empathy. Neural bases of theseabilities have been investigated extensively, and key brain structures such asthe amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and superior temporal sulcus, arecalled the "social brain" by some researchers. Social cognition has beendemonstrated to be an essential determinant of daily functioning inschizophrenia. Progress in social neuroscience, together with advancedneuroimaging technology, promotes our understanding of schizophrenia from theviewpoint of social cognition and the social brain.
 This study investigates paternal brain function with the hope of betterunderstanding the neural basis for variation in caregiving involvement among men.The neuropeptides oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) are implicated in paternal caregiving in humans and other species. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled,within-subject pharmaco-functional MRI experiment, we randomized 30 fathers of1-2year old children to receive either 24IU intranasal OT before one scan andplacebo before the other scan (n=15) or 20IU intranasal AVP before one scan andplacebo before the other scan (n=15). Brain function was measured with fMRI asthe fathers viewed pictures of their children, unknown children and unknownadults, and as they listened to unknown infant cry stimuli. Intranasal OT, butnot AVP, significantly increased the BOLD fMRI response to viewing pictures ofown children within the caudate nucleus, a target of midbrain dopamineprojections, as well as the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) and visual cortex,suggesting that intranasal oxytocin augments activation in brain regions involvedin reward, empathy and attention in human fathers. OT effects also varied as afunction of order of administration such that when OT was given before placebo,it increased activation within several reward-related structures (substantianigra, ventral tegmental area, putamen) more than when it was given afterplacebo. Neither OT nor AVP had significant main effects on the neural responseto cries. Our findings suggest that the hormonal changes associated with thetransition to fatherhood are likely to facilitate increased approach motivationand empathy for children, and call for future research that evaluates thepotential of OT to normalize deficits in paternal motivation, as might be foundamong men suffering from post-partum depression.
 Depressed mothers show negatively biased responses to their infants' emotionalbids, perhaps due to faulty processing of infant cues. This study is the first toexamine depression-related differences in mothers' neural response to their owninfant's emotion faces, considering both effects of perinatal depression history and current depressive symptoms. Primiparous mothers (n = 22), half of whom had ahistory of major depressive episodes (with one episode occurring during pregnancyand/or postpartum), were exposed to images of their own and unfamiliar infants'joy and distress faces during functional neuroimaging. Group differences(depression vs. no-depression) and continuous effects of current depressivesymptoms were tested in relation to neural response to own infant emotion faces. Compared to mothers with no psychiatric diagnoses, those with depression showedblunted responses to their own infant's distress faces in the dorsal anteriorcingulate cortex. Mothers with higher levels of current symptomatology showedreduced responses to their own infant's joy faces in the orbitofrontal cortex andinsula. Current symptomatology also predicted lower responses to own infantjoy-distress in left-sided prefrontal and insula/striatal regions. These deficitsin self-regulatory and motivational response circuits may help explain parenting difficulties in depressed mothers.
 This commentary discusses the findings and implications of four empirical papers that establish a reciprocal, longitudinal link between the social environment andexecutive functions from childhood to adolescence. Two future directions aresuggested by this work. The first is a call for measurement research to clarifythe nomological network of various measurements of self-regulation and executive functions across a variety of methods and procedures. The second new direction isto broaden the analysis of executive function to include a wider array ofpredictive adaptive responses to various environmental conditions, includingthose where youth are chronically marginalized or otherwise stressed. Findingsfrom these studies suggest that the executive functions within the brain guideadaptation in both deviant as well as competent responses to the socialenvironment. Understanding various forms of adaptation will enhance the potentialfor prevention as well as avoid iatrogenic intervention strategies withmisinformed targets.
 Many neurological, neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and psychosomaticdisorders are characterized by impairments in visual social cognition, bodylanguage reading, and facial assessment of a social counterpart. Yet a wealth of research indicates that individuals with Williams syndrome exhibit remarkableconcern for social stimuli and face fascination. Here individuals with Williamssyndrome were presented with a set of Face-n-Food images composed of foodingredients and in different degree resembling a face (slightly bordering on the Giuseppe Arcimboldo style). The primary advantage of these images is that single components do not explicitly trigger face-specific processing, whereas in faceimages commonly used for investigating face perception (such as photographs ordepictions), the mere occurrence of typical cues already implicates facepresence. In a spontaneous recognition task, participants were shown a set ofimages in a predetermined order from the least to most resembling a face.Strikingly, individuals with Williams syndrome exhibited profound deficits inrecognition of the Face-n-Food images as a face: they did not report seeing aface on the images, which typically developing controls effortlessly recognizedas a face, and gave overall fewer face responses. This suggests atypical facetuning in Williams syndrome. The outcome is discussed in the light of a generalpattern of social cognition in Williams syndrome and brain mechanismsunderpinning face processing.
 Fully-fledged affective systems in mature animals are in part the result of theimpact of infantile experience on brain development. The present experimentalseries examines whether tactile stimulation in infancy (early handling)influences rough-and-tumble play (R&T) throughout the juvenile period, using atesting regime of 17 days divided into five parts where handled (H) andnonhandled (NH) Wistar rats are assessed daily. In Parts 1 and 2 (age range atthe start: 30-33 days) the objective is to study the amount of R&T that the rats are capable of exhibiting under varying lengths of social deprivation. In Part 3 (37-40 days) the objective is to determine whether familiarity with theexperimental situation has independent or interactive effects with earlyhandling. In Part 4 (40-43 days) the objective is to obtain evidence of thesuppressing effects of an unexpected contextual change. In Part 5 (56-59 days)the objective is to study whether the effects of early handling can still bepresent at an age when R&T has practically vanished in NH rats. Results show thatearly handling invigorates R&T affecting pins (i.e., the most rewardingcomponent) at the expense of dorsal contacts by enhancing play motivation in aspecific manner, and that it is able to dilate the inverted-U developmental curveof this behavior, thereby providing strong evidence for a direct effect on theneuropsychological systems for play motivation.
 Social reorientation from parents to same-age peers is normative in adolescence, but the neural correlates of youths' socioemotional processing of parents andpeers have not been explored. In the current study, 22 adolescents (average age16.98) underwent neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) whileviewing and rating emotions shown in brief video clips featuring themselves,their parents, or an unfamiliar peer. Viewing self vs. other and parents vs. the peer activated regions in the medial prefrontal cortex, replicating priorfindings that this area responds to self-relevant stimuli, including familiar andnot just similar others. Viewing the peer compared with parents elicitedactivation in posterior 'mentalizing' structures, the precuneus, posteriorcingulate cortex (PCC), bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus and righttemporoparietal junction, as well as the ventral striatum and bilateral amygdala and hippocampus. Relative activations in the PCC and precuneus to the peer vs.the parent were related both to reported risk-taking behavior and to affiliationswith more risk-taking peers. The results suggest neural correlates of theadolescent social reorientation toward peers and away from parents that may beassociated with adolescents' real-life risk-taking behaviors and socialrelationships.
 BACKGROUND: Prior research indicates that blacks and Hispanics/Latinos haveflatter diurnal cortisol declines across the day, a profile associated withpoorer health. The stability of racial and ethnic differences in cortisol levels over time is not well understood, and additional research is needed to establish racial and ethnic differences in psychosocial stress levels as related to changesin cortisol levels. METHODS: With data from a community-based study of 152 adults(mean age = 58 years; 53% women; 34% black, 26% Hispanic/Latino), we examined themagnitude of racial and ethnic differences over a 5-year period. Salivarycortisol samples were obtained 3 times per day for 3 days in Years 1, 3, 4, and5. Life events and chronic stress were assessed by questionnaires in whichparticipants reported on whether they had experienced specific types of events orstress within the past year. Depressive symptoms scales (Center for EpidemiologicStudies of Depression Scale) were also administered annually. Daily cortisolslopes were calculated by subtracting wakeup cortisol from bedtime levels anddividing by hours awake. RESULTS: Increases in psychosocial stress wereassociated with flatter cortisol slopes among blacks (beta = 0.010) andHispanics/Latinos (beta = 0.014), although including cardiovascular disease risk factors attenuates associations in blacks (beta = 0.007; p = .125). Higher incomepredicts a steepening of cortisol rhythms across the study (beta = -0.003; p =.019). CONCLUSIONS: Racial and ethnic differences in diurnal cortisol rhythms arestable over time. However, the magnitude of changes in cortisol levels associatedwith chronic stress levels may vary by racial and ethnic subgroups.
 Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to a constellation of traits, competencies, orabilities that allow individuals to understand emotional information andsuccessfully navigate and solve social/emotional problems. While little is known about the neurobiological substrates that underlie EI, some evidence suggeststhat these capacities may involve a core neurocircuitry involved in emotionaldecision-making that includes the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC),anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, and amygdala. In a sample of 39 healthy volunteers (22 men; 17 women), scores on the Bar-On EQ-i (a trait/mixed model of EI) and Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT; an abilitymodel of EI) were correlated with functional magnetic resonance imaging responsesduring brief presentations of moving facial expressions that changed in the levelof perceived trustworthiness. Core emotion neurocircuitry was responsive todynamic changes in facial features, regardless of whether they reflectedincreases or decreases in apparent trustworthiness. In response to facialmovements indicating decreasing trustworthiness, MSCEIT correlated positivelywith functional responses of the vmPFC and rostral ACC, whereas the EQ-i wasunrelated to regional activation. Systematic differences in EI ability appear to be significantly related to the responsiveness of the vmPFC and rostral ACC tofacial movements suggesting potential trustworthiness.
 We employed a social network analysis approach to examine the associationsbetween friendship network position and cortisol levels. The sample consisted of 74 first-year students (93% female, ages 22-38 years, M = 27) from a highlycompetitive, accelerated Nursing program. Participants completed questionnairesonline, and the entire group met at one time to complete a series of sociometric nominations and donated a saliva sample. Saliva was later assayed for cortisol.Metrics derived from directed friendship nominations indexed each student'sfriendship network status regarding popularity, gregariousness, and degree ofinterconnectedness. Results revealed that (1) individuals with lowergregariousness status (i.e., lowest number of outgoing ties) had higher cortisol levels, and (2) individuals with higher popularity status (i.e., higher numbersof incoming ties) had higher cortisol levels. Popularity and gregariousness-basednetwork status is significantly associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenalaxis activity. Implications for prevailing theories of the social determinants ofindividual differences in biological sensitivity and susceptibility to contextare discussed.
 Empathic concern has traditionally been conceived of as a spontaneous reaction toothers experiencing pain or distress. As such, the potential role of moredeliberate control over empathic responses has frequently been overlooked. Thepresent fMRI study evaluated the role of such deliberate control in empathicconcern by examining the extent to which a sample of offenders recruited through probation/parole could voluntarily modulate their neural activity to anotherperson in pain. Offenders were asked to either passively view pictures of otherpeople in painful or non-painful situations, or to actively modulate their level of concern for the person in pain. During passive viewing of painful versusnon-painful pictures, offenders showed minimal neural activity in regionspreviously linked to empathy for pain (e.g., dorsal anterior cingulate cortex andbilateral insula). However, when instructed to try to increase their concern for the person in pain, offenders demonstrated significant increases within theseregions. These findings are consistent with recent theories of empathy asmotivational in nature, and suggest that limitations in empathic concern mayinclude a motivational component.
 The experience of embarrassment provides a highly salient cue for the human moralapparatus. Interestingly, people also experience embarrassment on behalf ofothers' inappropriate conditions. The perceiver's embarrassment often lacks anequivalent expression of embarrassment in the social counterpart. The presentstudy examines this phenomenon and distinguishes neural circuits involved inembarrassment with and embarrassment for another person's mishaps. Usingfunctional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that the embarrassment on behalfof others engages the temporal pole and the medial prefrontal cortex, centralstructures of the mentalizing network, together with the anterior insula andanterior cingulate cortex. In contrast, sharing others' embarrassmentadditionally stimulated the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS), whichexhibited increased functional integration with inferior parietal and insularcortex areas. These findings characterize common neural circuits involved in the embodied representation of embarrassment and further unravel the unique role ofthe posterior STS in sharing others' affective state.
 Numerous studies using the event-related potential (ERP) technique have foundthat emotional expressions modulate ERP components appearing at differentpost-stimulus onset times and are indicative of different stages of faceprocessing. With the aim of studying the time course of integration of contextand facial expression information, we investigated whether these modulations are sensitive to the situational context in which emotional expressions areperceived. Participants were asked to identify the expression of target facesthat were presented immediately after reading short sentences that describedhappy or anger-inducing situations. The main manipulation was the congruencybetween the emotional content of the sentences and the target expression.Context-independent amplitude modulation of the N170 and N400 components byemotional expression was observed. On the other hand, context effects appeared ona later component (late positive potential, or LPP), with enhanced amplitudes on incongruent trials. These results show that the early stages of face processingwhere emotional expressions are coded are not sensitive to verbal informationabout the situation in which they appear. The timing of context congruencyeffects suggests that integration of facial expression with situationalinformation occurs at a later stage, probably related to the detection ofaffective congruency.
 Using a rapid serial visual presentation paradigm, we previously showed that the average amplitudes of six event-related potential (ERP) components were affected by different categories of emotional faces. In the current study, we investigatedthe six discriminating components on a single-trial level to clarify whether the amplitude difference between experimental conditions results from a difference inthe real variability of single-trial amplitudes or from latency jitter acrosstrials. It is found that there were consistent amplitude differences in thesingle-trial P1, N170, VPP, N3, and P3 components, demonstrating that asubstantial proportion of the average amplitude differences can be explained bythe pure variability in amplitudes on a single-trial basis between experimentalconditions. These single-trial results verified the three-stage scheme of facial expression processing beyond multitrial ERP averaging, and showed the threeprocessing stages of "fear popup", "emotional/unemotional discrimination", and"complete separation" based on the single-trial ERP dynamics.
 This study investigated whether detachment-type dissociation,compartmentalisation-type dissociation or absorption was most strongly associatedwith psychosis-like experiences in the general population. Healthy participants(N=215) were tested with the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES, fordetachment-related dissociative experiences); the Harvard Group Scale of HypnoticSusceptibility (HGSHS: A, for dissociative compartmentalisation); the TellegenAbsorption Scale (TAS, for non-clinical 'functional' dissociative experience);and two measures of psychotic-like experiences, the 21-item Peters et al.Delusions Inventory (PDI-21) and the Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale (CAPS). In multiple regression analyses, DES and TAS but not HGSHS: A scores were foundto be significantly associated with PDI-21 and CAPS overall scores. A post hochierarchical cluster analysis checking for cluster overlap between DES and CAPSitems, and the TAS and CAPS items showed no overlap between items on the DES and CAPS and minimal overlap between TAS and CAPS items, suggesting the scalesmeasure statistically distinct phenomena. These results show that detachment-typedissociation and absorption, but not compartmentalisation-type dissociation aresignificantly associated with psychosis-like experiences in a non-clinicalpopulation.
 Two experiments were performed to investigate the principles by which emotionalstimuli are classified on the dimensions of valence and arousal. In Experiment 1,a large sample of healthy participants rated emotional stimuli according to both broad dimensions. Hierarchical cluster analyses performed on these ratingsrevealed that stimuli were clustered according to their semantic content at thebeginning of the agglomerative process. Example semantic themes include food,violence, nudes, death, and objects. Importantly, this pattern occurred in aparallel fashion for ratings on both dimensions. In Experiment 2, we investigatedif the same semantic clusters were differentiated at the neurophysiologicallevel. Intracerebral EEG was recorded from 18 patients with intractable epilepsy who viewed the same set of stimuli. Not only did electrocortical responsesdifferentiate between these data-defined semantic clusters, they converged withthe behavioral measurements to highlight the importance of categories associated with survival and reproduction. These findings provide strong evidence that thesemantic content of affective material influences their classification along the broad dimensions of valence and arousal, and this principle of categorizationexerts an effect on the evoked emotional response. Future studies should considerdata-driven techniques rather than normative ratings to identify more specific,semantically related emotional images.
 In case of uncertainty, predictions that are based on prior, similar experiences guide our decision by processes of generalization. Over-generalization ofnegative information has been identified as an important feature of severalpsychopathologies, including anxiety disorders and depression, and might underliebiased interpretation of ambiguous information. Here, we investigated the neural correlates of valence generalization to ambiguous stimuli using a translationalaffective conditioning task during fMRI. Twenty-five healthy individualsparticipated in a conditioning procedure with (1) an initial acquisition phase,where participants learned the positive and negative valence of two differenttones (reference tones) through their responses and subsequent feedback and (2) atest phase, where participants were presented with the previously learnedreference tones and three additional tones with intermediate frequency to thelearned reference tones. By recording the responses to these intermediate stimuliwe were able to assess the participantsi interpretation of ambiguous tones aseither positive or negative. Behavioral results revealed a graded responsepattern to the three intermediate tones, which was mirrored on the neural level. More specifically, parametric analyses OF BOLD responses to all five tonesrevealed a linear effect in bilateral anterior insula and SMA with lowestactivation to the negative reference tone and highest activation to the positive negative tone. In addition, a cluster in the SMA showed a reverse-quadraticresponse, i.e., the strongest response for the most ambiguous tone. Thesefindings suggest overlapping regions in the salience network that mediate valencegeneralization and decision-making under ambiguity, potentially underlying biasedambiguous cue interpretation.
 The literature has been relatively silent about post-conflict processes. However,understanding the way humans deal with post-conflict situations is a challenge inour societies. With this in mind, we focus the present study on the rationalityof cooperative decision making after an intergroup conflict, i.e., the extent to which groups take advantage of post-conflict situations to obtain benefits fromcollaborating with the other group involved in the conflict. Based ondual-process theories of thinking and affect heuristic, we propose thatintergroup conflict hinders the rationality of cooperative decision making. Wealso hypothesize that this rationality improves when groups are involved in anin-group deliberative discussion. Results of a laboratory experiment support the idea that intergroup conflict -associated with indicators of the activation ofnegative feelings (negative affect state and heart rate)- has a negative effecton the aforementioned rationality over time and on both group and individualdecision making. Although intergroup conflict leads to sub-optimal decisionmaking, rationality improves when groups and individuals subjected to intergroup conflict make decisions after an in-group deliberative discussion. Additionally, the increased rationality of the group decision making after the deliberativediscussion is transferred to subsequent individual decision making.
 Dehumanized perception, a failure to spontaneously consider the mind of anotherperson, may be a psychological mechanism facilitating inhumane acts like torture.Social cognition - considering someone's mind - recognizes the other as a humanbeing subject to moral treatment. Social neuroscience has reliably shown thatparticipants normally activate a social-cognition neural network to pictures and thoughts of other people; our previous work shows that parts of this networkuniquely fail to engage for traditionally dehumanized targets (homeless personsor drug addicts; see Harris & Fiske, 2009, for review). This suggestsparticipants may not consider these dehumanized groups' minds. Study 1demonstrates that participants do fail to spontaneously think about the contents of these targets' minds when imagining a day in their life, and rate themdifferently on a number of human-perception dimensions. Study 2 shows that these human-perception dimension ratings correlate with activation in brain regionsbeyond the social-cognition network, including areas implicated in disgust,attention, and cognitive control. These results suggest that disengaging socialcognition affects a number of other brain processes and hints at some of thecomplex psychological mechanisms potentially involved in atrocities againsthumanity.
 Explicit but not implicit facial emotion perception has been shown to be impairedin schizophrenia. In this study, we used newly developed technology in socialneuroscience to examine implicit emotion processing. It has been shown that when people look at faces, they automatically infer social traits, and these traitjudgments rely heavily on facial features and subtle emotion expressions evenwith neutral faces. Eighty-one individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 62 control subjects completed a computer task with 30well-characterized neutral faces. They rated each face on 10 trait judgments:attractive, mean, trustworthy, intelligent, dominant, fun, sociable, aggressive, emotionally stable and weird. The degree to which trait ratings were predicted byobjectively-measured subtle emotion expressions served as a measure of implicitemotion processing. Explicit emotion recognition was also examined. Trait ratingswere significantly predicted by subtle facial emotional expressions in controlsand patients. However, impairment in the implicit emotion perception of fear,happiness, anger and surprise was found in patients. Moreover, these deficitswere associated with poorer everyday problem-solving skills and were relativelyindependent of explicit emotion recognition. Implicit emotion processing isimpaired in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Deficits in implicit and explicit emotion perception independently contribute to thepatients' poor daily life skills. More research is needed to fully understand therole of implicit and explicit processes in the functional deficits of patients,in order to develop targeted and useful remediation interventions.
 Over the last decade, oxytocin (OT) has received focus in numerous studiesassociating intranasal administration of this peptide with various aspects ofhuman social behavior. These studies in humans are inspired by animal research,especially in rodents, showing that central manipulations of the OT system affectbehavioral phenotypes related to social cognition, including parental behavior,social bonding, and individual recognition. Taken together, these studies inhumans appear to provide compelling, but sometimes bewildering, evidence for the role of OT in influencing a vast array of complex social cognitive processes inhumans. In this article, we investigate to what extent the human intranasal OTliterature lends support to the hypothesis that intranasal OT consistentlyinfluences a wide spectrum of social behavior in humans. We do this byconsidering statistical features of studies within this field, including factors like statistical power, prestudy odds, and bias. Our conclusion is thatintranasal OT studies are generally underpowered and that there is a highprobability that most of the published intranasal OT findings do not representtrue effects. Thus, the remarkable reports that intranasal OT influences a large number of human social behaviors should be viewed with healthy skepticism, and wemake recommendations to improve the reliability of human OT studies in thefuture.
 Previous neuroimaging studies on decision making have mainly focused on decisionson behalf of oneself. Considering that people often make decisions on behalf ofothers, it is intriguing that there is little neurobiological evidence on howdecisions for others differ from those for oneself. The present study directlycompared risky decisions for self with those for another person using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants were asked to perform a gambling task on behalf of themselves (decision-for-self condition) or another person(decision-for-other condition) while in the scanner. Their task was to choosebetween a low-risk option (i.e., win or lose 10 points) and a high-risk option(i.e., win or lose 90 points) with variable levels of winning probability.Compared with choices regarding others, those regarding oneself were morerisk-averse at lower winning probabilities and more risk-seeking at higherwinning probabilities, perhaps due to stronger affective process during riskydecisions for oneself compared with those for other. The brain-activation patternchanged according to the target, such that reward-related regions were moreactive in the decision-for-self condition than in the decision-for-othercondition, whereas brain regions related to the theory of mind (ToM) showedgreater activation in the decision-for-other condition than in thedecision-for-self condition. Parametric modulation analysis using individualdecision models revealed that activation of the amygdala and the dorsomedialprefrontal cortex (DMPFC) were associated with value computations for oneself andfor another, respectively, during risky financial decisions. The results of thepresent study suggest that decisions for oneself and for other may recruitfundamentally distinct neural processes, which can be mainly characterized asdominant affective/impulsive and cognitive/regulatory processes, respectively.
 Homophily, or "love for similar others," has been shown to play a fundamentalrole in the formation of interpersonal ties and social networks. Yet no study hasinvestigated whether perceived similarities can affect tacit coordination. We had68 participants attempt to maximize real monetary earnings by choosing between a safe but low paying option (that could be obtained with certainty) and apotentially higher paying but "risky" one, which depended on the choice of amatched counterpart. While making their choices participants were mutuallyinformed of whether their counterparts similarly or dissimilarly identified with three person-descriptive words as themselves. We found that similarity increased the rate of "risky" choices only when the game required counterparts to matchtheir choices (stag hunt games). Conversely, similarity led to decreased riskrates when they were to tacitly decouple their choices (entry games). Notably,though similarity increased coordination in the matching environment, it did not did not increase it in the decoupling game. In spite of this, similarityincreased (expected) payoffs across both coordination environments. This couldshed light on why homophily is so successful as a social attractor. Finally, thispropensity for matching and aversion to decoupling choices was not observed when participants "liked" their counterparts but were dissimilar to them. We thusconclude that the impact of similarity of coordination should not be reduced to"liking" others (i.e., social preferences) but it is also about predicting them.
 Brain arginine vasopressin (AVP) not only regulates male social behavior andemotionality, but also promotes maternal behavior, as has been shown in rats. In our CD1 mice breed for high (HAB) or low (LAB) anxiety-related behavior, LAB micehave markedly less AVP mRNA expression in the hypothalamic paraventricularnucleus compared with HAB mice. Together these findings suggest that HAB and LAB mice represent a good model to assess the role of AVP in mouse maternal behavior.Therefore, we studied maternal care of HAB and LAB mouse dams and investigatedthe impact of maternal care on the offspring's anxiety in a cross-fosteringparadigm. In comparison with HAB dams, LABs displayed less maternal care. Dailyacute intracerebroventricular infusions of AVP in early lactation increasedmaternal care of LAB dams and acted anxiogenically. Cross-fostering on postnatal day 5 did not alter separation-induced high and low ultrasonic vocalizationcalling frequency, a measure of inborn anxiety, in HAB and LAB offspring,respectively. However, adult cross-fostered HAB mice displayed a trend towardsdecreased anxiety on the elevated plus-maze, which was still significantly highercompared with LAB mice. The low levels of depressive-like behavior,stress-reactivity, and hypothalamic AVP mRNA expression in adult LAB offspringwere found to be independent of cross-fostering. In conclusion, the HAB/LABdifferences in maternal care and anxiety are robust and strongly depend ondifferences in the AVP system. The seemingly rigid genetic predisposition tohyperanxiety can only be moderately attenuated by the received nurturing.
 The present study (N = 55) used an event-related potential paradigm toinvestigate whether cultures differ in the ability to upregulate affectiveresponses. Using stimuli selected from the International Affective PictureSystem, we found that European-Americans (N = 29) enhanced central-parietal late positive potential (LPP) (400-800 ms post-stimulus) responses to affectivestimuli when instructed to do so, whereas East Asians (N = 26) did not. Weobserved cultural differences in the ability to enhance central-parietal LPPresponses for both positively and negativelyvalenced stimuli, and the ability to enhance these two types of responses was positively correlated for Americans but negatively for East Asians. These results are consistent with the notion thatcultural variations in norms and values regarding affective expression andexperiences shape how the brain regulates emotions.
 Does sentence comprehension related to faces modulate activity in the fusiformface area (FFA) and does sentence comprehension related to places modulateactivity in the parahippocampal place area (PPA)? We investigated this questionin an fMRI experiment. Participants listened to sentences describing faces,places, or objects, with the latter serving as a control condition. In a separaterun, we localized the FFA and PPA in each participant using a perceptual task. Weobserved a significant interaction between the region of interest (FFA vs. PPA)and sentence type (face vs. place). Activity in the left FFA was modulated byface sentences and in the left PPA was modulated by place sentences.Surprisingly, activation in each region of interest was reduced when listening tosentences requiring semantic analysis related to that region's domainspecificity. No modulation was found in the corresponding right hemisphere ROIs. We conclude that processing sentences may involve inhibition of some visualprocessing areas in a content-specific manner. Furthermore, our data indicatethat this semantic-based modulation is restricted to the left hemisphere. Wediscuss how these results may constrain neural models of embodied semantics.
 During every social approach, humans must assess each other's intentions. Facial expressions provide cues to assist in these assessments via associations withemotion, the likelihood of affiliation, and personality. In this functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, participants viewed animated malecharacters approaching them in a hallway and making either a happy or an angryfacial expression. An expected increase in amygdala and superior temporal sulcus activation to the expression of anger was found. Notably, two other social brain regions also had an increased hemodynamic response to anger relative tohappiness, including the lateral fusiform gyrus and a region centered in themiddle temporal gyrus. Other brain regions showed little differentiation or anincreased level of activity to the happy stimuli. These findings provide insight into the brain mechanisms involved in reading the intentions of other humanbeings in an overtly social context. In particular, they demonstrate brainregions sensitive to social signals of dominance and affiliation.
 Biologically significant, natural human body odors covey emotion andidentity--two qualities shown to build on dissociated modules in face and voiceperceptions. To what extent such segregation applies to chemosensory processingof body odors has hardly been studied. The current study probes this issue byrecruiting heterosexual couples, who are genetically independent yet sexually andemotionally engaged to one another, as both odor donors and odor judges, andcomparing their sensitivities to the chemosensory emotional cues from theirpartner vs. those from opposite-sex strangers. We demonstrate that familiaritysubconsciously sharpens one's sensitivity to chemosensory emotional cues, whichincreases as a function of the time couples have spent together. Nevertheless,the specific chemosensory identity and emotional content remain undelineated and inaccessible to verbal awareness. Our findings reveal a different pattern fromthose of face and voice perceptions and provide insights into the mechanisms and interplays of chemosensory emotion and identity processings.
 Cultural differences in emotion recognition performance have frequently beenreported, whereby duration of stay in a foreign culture seems to be a crucialfactor. Furthermore, cultural aspects influence the neural correlates of face andemotion processing thereby also affecting the response of the amygdala. Here, theexposure to a foreign culture and its influence on the cerebral correlates offacial emotion recognition were examined in 24 Asian and 24 age-matched European males. Subjects performed an explicit emotion recognition task and were imagedwith a 3 T MR-scanner. Results demonstrate a significant cultural influence onthe specific recognition of disgust and anger, with higher accuracy among theEuropeans, while the functional data indicate generally elevated amygdalaactivation in Asians compared to Europeans. Moreover, a significant inversecorrelation between duration of stay and amygdala response emerged, with strongeractivation in those subjects with shorter duration of stay in Europe. Theobserved amygdala hyperactivation in Asians may reflect novelty aspects but mightalso be associated with greater effort and motivation in immigrants, thus itpossibly reflects one neural correlate of the "alien-effect". We conclude thatexposure to a foreign culture and duration of stay affect the behavioral andneural response to facial expressions of emotions.
 Perceiving human faces constitutes a fundamental ability of the human mind,integrating a wealth of information essential for social interactions in everydaylife. Neuroimaging studies have unveiled a distributed neural network consisting of multiple brain regions in both hemispheres. Whereas the individual regions in the face perception network and the right-hemispheric dominance for faceprocessing have been subject to intensive research, the functional integrationamong these regions and hemispheres has received considerably less attention.Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) for fMRI, we analyzed the effectiveconnectivity between the core regions in the face perception network of healthyhumans to unveil the mechanisms underlying both intra- and interhemisphericintegration. Our results suggest that the right-hemispheric lateralization of thenetwork is due to an asymmetric face-specific interhemispheric recruitment at an early processing stage - that is, at the level of the occipital face area (OFA)but not the fusiform face area (FFA). As a structural correlate, we found thatOFA gray matter volume was correlated with this asymmetric interhemisphericrecruitment. Furthermore, exploratory analyses revealed that interhemisphericconnection asymmetries were correlated with the strength of pupil constriction inresponse to faces, a measure with potential sensitivity to holistic (as opposedto feature-based) processing of faces. Overall, our findings thus provide amechanistic description for lateralized processes in the core face perceptionnetwork, point to a decisive role of interhemispheric integration at an earlystage of face processing among bilateral OFA, and tentatively indicate a relationto individual variability in processing strategies for faces. These findingsprovide a promising avenue for systematic investigations of the potential role ofinterhemispheric integration in future studies.
 According to previous literature, trait anxiety is related to the tendency tochoose safety options during risk decision-making, that is, risk avoidance. Inour opinion, anxious people's risk preference might actually reflect theirhypersensitivity to emotional information. To examine this hypothesis, adecision-making task that could elicit the framing effect was employed. Theframing effect indicates that risk preference could be modulated by emotionalmessages contained in the description (i.e., frame) of options. The behavioralresults have showed the classic framing effect. In addition, individual level of trait anxiety was positively correlated with the framing effect size. However,trait anxiety was not correlated with risk-avoidance ratio in any condition.Finally, the relationship between anxiety and the framing effect remainedsignificant after the level of depression was also taken into account. Thetheoretical significance and the major limitations of this study are discussed.
 Although many different accounts of the functions of the default mode network(DMN) have been proposed, few can adequately account for the spectrum ofdifferent cognitive functions that utilize this network. The current study usedfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the hypothesis that therole of the DMN in higher order cognition is to allow cognition to be shaped byinformation from stored representations rather than information in the immediate environment. Using a novel task paradigm, we observed increased BOLD activity in regions of the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex whenindividuals made decisions on the location of shapes from the prior trial anddecreased BOLD activity when individuals made decisions on the location of shapeson the current trial. These data are inconsistent with views of the DMN as atask-negative system or one that is sensitive only to stimuli with strongpersonal or emotional ties. Instead the involvement of the DMN when people makedecisions about where a shape was, rather than where it is now, supports thehypothesis that the core hubs of the DMN allow cognition to be guided byinformation other than the immediate perceptual input. We propose that a variety of different forms of higher order thought (such as imagining the future orconsidering the perspective of another person) engage the DMN because these more complex introspective forms of higher order thought all depend on the capacityfor cognition to be shaped by representations that are not present in theexternal environment.
 The lateral prefrontal cortex undergoes both structural and functional changeswith healthy aging. In contrast, there is little structural change in the medial prefrontal cortex, but relatively little is known about the functional changes tothis region with age. Using an event-related fMRI design, we investigated theresponse of medial prefrontal cortex during self-referencing in order to compare age groups on a task that young and elderly perform similarly and that is knownto actively engage the region in young adults. Nineteen young (M age = 23) andseventeen elderly (M age = 72) judged whether adjectives described themselves,another person, or were presented in upper case. We assessed the overlap inactivations between young and elderly for the self-reference effect (self vs.other person), and found that both groups engage medial prefrontal cortex andmid-cingulate during self-referencing. The only cerebral differences between the groups in self versus other personality assessment were found in somatosensoryand motor-related areas. In contrast, age-related modulations were found in thecerebral network recruited for emotional valence processing. Elderly (but notyoung) showed increased activity in the dorsal prefrontal cortex for positiverelative to negative items, which could reflect an increase in controlledprocessing of positive information for elderly adults.
 Ostracism is ubiquitous across the lifespan. From social exclusion on theplayground, to romantic rejection, to workplace expulsion, to social disregardfor the aged, ostracism threatens a fundamental human need to belong thatreflexively elicits social pain and sadness. Older adults may be particularlyvulnerable to ostracism because of loss of network members and meaningfulsocietal roles. On the other hand, socioemotional selectivity theory suggeststhat older adults may be less impacted by ostracism because of an age-relatedpositivity bias. We examined these hypotheses in two independent studies, andtested mechanisms that may account for age differences in the affectiveexperience of ostracism. A study of 18- to 86-year-old participants in theTime-Sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences program showed an age-relateddecrease in the impact of ostracism on needs satisfaction and negativeaffectivity. A study of 53- to 71-year-old participants in the Chicago Health,Aging, and Social Relations Study (CHASRS) showed that ostracism diminishedpositive affectivity in younger (<60 years) but not older adults. Age groupdifferences in response to ostracism were consistent with the positivity biashypothesis, were partly explained by age differences in the impact of physicalpain, but were not explained by autonomic nervous system activity, computerexperience, or intimate social loss or stressful life experiences.
 Recent advances in neuroimaging have offered a rich array of structural andfunctional markers to probe the organization of regional and large-scale brainnetworks. The current chapter provides a brief introduction into these techniquesand overviews their contribution to the understanding of autism spectrum disorder(ASD), a neurodevelopmental condition associated with atypical social cognition, language function, and repetitive behaviors/interests. While it is generallyrecognized that ASD relates to structural and functional network anomalies, theextent and overall pattern of reported findings have been rather heterogeneous.Indeed, while several attempts have been made to label the main neuroimagingphenotype of ASD (e.g., 'early brain overgrowth hypothesis', 'amygdala theory','disconnectivity hypothesis'), none of these frameworks has been withoutcontroversy. Methodological sources of inconsistent results may includedifferences in subject inclusion criteria, variability in image processing, andanalysis methodology. However, inconsistencies may also relate to highheterogeneity across the autism spectrum itself. It, therefore, remains to beinvestigated whether a consistent imaging phenotype that adequately describes theentire autism spectrum can, in fact, be established. On the other hand, asprevious findings clearly emphasize the value of neuroimaging in identifyingatypical brain morphology, function, and connectivity, they ultimately supportits high potential to identify biologically and clinically relevantendophenotypes.
 Although shyness is associated with deficits in different aspects of faceprocessing including face recognition and facial emotions, we know relativelylittle about the neural correlates of face processing among individuals who areshy. Here we show reduced activation to stranger faces among shy adults in a key brain area involved in face processing. Event-related functional magneticresonance imaging scans were acquired on 12 shy and 12 social young adults duringthe rapid presentation of stranger and personally familiar neutral faces. Shyadults exhibited significantly less bilateral activation in the fusiform facearea (FFA) in response to stranger faces and significantly greater bilateralactivation in the same region to personally familiar faces than their socialcounterparts. Shy adults also exhibited significantly greater right amygdalaactivation in response to stranger faces than social adults. Among social adults,stranger faces elicited greater FFA activation than personally familiar faces.Findings suggest that there are distinct patterns of neural activation in the FFAin response to viewing stranger and personally familiar faces among shy andsocial adults.
 This study explored the effect of lateralized left-right resting brain activityon prefrontal cortical responsiveness to emotional cues and on the explicitappraisal (stimulus evaluation) of emotions based on their valence. Indeedsubjective responses to different emotional stimuli should be predicted by brain resting activity and should be lateralized and valence-related (positive vsnegative valence). A hemodynamic measure was considered (functional near-infraredspectroscopy). Indeed hemodynamic resting activity and brain response toemotional cues were registered when subjects (N = 19) viewed emotional positivevs negative stimuli (IAPS). Lateralized index response during resting state, LI(lateralized index) during emotional processing and self-assessment manikinrating were considered. Regression analysis showed the significant predictiveeffect of resting activity (more left or right lateralized) on both brainresponse and appraisal of emotional cues based on stimuli valence. Moreover,significant effects were found as a function of valence (more right response tonegative stimuli; more left response to positive stimuli) during emotionprocessing. Therefore, resting state may be considered a predictive marker of thesuccessive cortical responsiveness to emotions. The significance of restingcondition for emotional behavior was discussed.
 Human beings process perceptual and affective information of racial out-groups ina degraded manner. Relative to racial in-group members, we lack perceptualindividuation of racial out-group members and empathize their pain to a lessdegree. To date, however, the relationship between the deficiency ofindividuation and the impairment of empathy in responding to racial out-groupsremains elusive. By recording event-related brain potentials in response toracial in-group and out-group faces portraying pain and neutral expressions, wesimultaneously measured neural activity that underpinned individuation andempathy. Deficiency in individuating members of racial out-groups, manifesting asreduced reactivity of face-sensitive N170 in the occipitotemporal region of thebrain, predicted attenuation of fronto-central empathic response to the sufferingof racial out-groups. Further, the individuation bias mediated the influence ofracial prejudice on racial in-group bias in empathic neural responses. Thesefindings suggest an interplay between degraded perceptual and affectiveprocessing of racial out-groups.
 Social neuroscience offers a window into the mental origins of empathy. Peoplemust appreciate another mind in order to empathize. People first categorize theother as human, assuming a mind, and then differentiate among social categoriesaccording to universal dimensions of perceived traits: warmth and competence. Theleast warm and competent groups (poor people, homeless, drug addicts) may even bedenied humanity and a meaningful mind, according to both neural and behavioralresponses to allegedly disgusting outcasts. Other groups may be instead enviedand viewed as tools or automatons, that is, objectified. The patterns can reversewhen perceivers must consider the other's preferences, that is, appreciate theother's mind.
 Emerging evidence from decision neuroscience suggests that although younger andolder adults show similar frontostriatal representations of reward magnitude,older adults often show deficits in feedback-driven reinforcement learning. Inthe present study, healthy adults completed reward-based tasks that did or didnot depend on probabilistic learning, while undergoing functional neuroimaging.We observed reductions in the frontostriatal representation of prediction errors during probabilistic learning in older adults. In contrast, we found evidence forstability across adulthood in the representation of reward outcome in a task thatdid not require learning. Together, the results identify changes across adulthoodin the dynamic coding of relational representations of feedback, in spite ofpreserved reward sensitivity in old age. Overall, the results suggest that theneural representation of prediction error, but not reward outcome, is reduced in old age. These findings reveal a potential dissociation between cognition andmotivation with age and identify a potential mechanism for explaining changes in learning-dependent decision making in old adulthood.
 Previous studies have shown that the amygdala is more involved in processinganimate categories, such as humans and animals, than inanimate objects, butlittle is known regarding whether this animate advantage applies to auditorystimuli. To address this issue, we performed a functional Magnetic ResonanceImaging (fMRI) study with emotion and category as factors, in which subjectsheard sounds from different categories (i.e., humans, animals, and objects) innegative and neutral dimensions. Emotional levels and semantic familiarity werematched across categories. The results showed that the amygdala responded more tohuman vocalization than to animal vocalization and sounds of inanimate objects inboth negative and neutral valences, and more to animal sounds than to objects in neural condition. In addition, the amygdala, together with the insula and theright superior temporal sulcus, further distinguished human voices from animalsounds. These data indicated that the amygdala is prepared to respond to animate sources, especially human vocalizations in auditory modality.
 The quality of a team depends on its ability to deliver information through ahierarchy of team members and negotiate processes spanning different time scales.That structure and the behavior that results from it pose problems forresearchers because multiply-nested interactions are not easily separated. Weexplored the behavior of a six-person team engaged in a Submarine Piloting andNavigation (SPAN) task using the tools of dynamical systems. The data were asingle entropy time series that showed the distribution of activity across sixteam members, as recorded by nine-channel electroencephalography (EEG). A single team's data were analyzed for the purposes of illustrating the utility ofmultifractal analysis and allowing for in-depth exploratory analysis of temporal characteristics. Could the meaningful events experienced by one of these teams becaptured using multifractal analysis, a dynamical systems tool that isspecifically designed to extract patterns across levels of analysis? Resultsindicate that nested patterns of team activity can be identified from neural datastreams, including both routine and novel events. The novelty of this tool is theability to identify social patterns from the brain activity of individuals in thesocial interaction. Implications for application and future directions of thisresearch are discussed.
 Early neuroimaging studies using Cyberball suggested that social rejectionactivated the pain matrix, as identified in studies of physical pain. However,these early studies were characterized by small sample sizes. Our statisticalmulti-level kernel density analysis (MKDA) of Cyberball neuroimaging studies with244 participants fails to support the claim that social rejection operates on thesame pain matrix as nociceptive stimuli, questioning whether social pain is more figurative or literal. We also performed an MKDA of the neuroimaging studies ofreliving a romantic rejection to test whether the pain matrix was activated ifthe rejection were more meaningful. Results again failed to support the notionthat rejection activates the neural matrix identified in studies of physicalpain. Reliving an unwanted rejection by a romantic partner was significantlycharacterized by activation within and beyond the "Cyberball" brain network,suggesting that the neural correlates of social pain are more complex thanpreviously thought.
 Recent studies demonstrated that beta oscillations are elicited during cognitive processes. To investigate their potential as electrophysiological markers ofamnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), we recorded beta EEG activity duringresting and during an omitted tone task in patients and healthy elderly. Thirtyparticipants were enrolled (15 patients, 15 healthy controls). In particular, we investigated event-related spectral perturbation and intertrial coherenceindices. Analyses showed that (a) healthy elderly presented greater beta power atrest than patients with aMCI patients; (b) during the task, healthy elderly were more accurate than aMCI patients and presented greater beta power than aMCIpatients; (c) both groups showed qualitatively similar spectral perturbationresponses during the task, but different spatiotemporal response patterns; and(d) aMCI patients presented greater beta phase locking than healthy elderlyduring the task. Results indicate that beta activity in healthy elderly differsfrom that of patients with aMCI. Furthermore, the analysis of task-related EEGactivity extends evidences obtained during resting and suggests that during theprodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease there is a reduced efficiency ininformation exchange by large-scale neural networks. The study for the first timeshows the potential of task-related beta responses as early markers of aMCIimpairments.
 Affective response to observation of intra-species and inter-species interactionswas considered in the present research. The brain activity (optical imaging:functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy, fNIRS; and event-related potentials, ERPs,N200) was monitored when subjects observed interactive situations (human-human,HH; human-animal, HA) with a positive (cooperative), negative (uncooperative) or neutral (no emotional) content. In addition, cortical lateralization (more leftor right prefrontal activity) and personality component (Behavioral ActivationSystem, BAS; Behavioral Inhibition System, BIS) effects were explored. Both ERPand fNIRS showed significant brain activity increasing in response to positiveand negative compared with neutral interactions for HH and HA. However, somedifferences were found between HH (more "negative valence" effect) and HA (more"positive valence" effect). Finally BAS and BIS were related respectively to moreleft (positive conditions) or right (negative conditions) hemispheric activity.These results supported the significance of affective behavior differentiatingthe species-specific and species-aspecific relationships.
 The reputation of others influences partner selection in human cooperativebehaviors through verbal reputation representation. Although the way in whichhumans represent the verbal reputations of others is a pivotal issue for socialneuroscience, the neural correlates underlying the representation of verbalreputations of others are unclear. Humans primarily depend on self-evaluationwhen assessing reputation of self. Likewise, humans might primarily depend onself-evaluation of others when representing their reputation. As interactionpromotes the formation of more nuanced, individualized impressions of aninteraction partner, humans tend to form self-evaluations of persons with whomthey are intimate in their daily life. Thus, we hypothesized that therepresentation of reputation of others is modulated by intimacy due to one's own evaluation formation of that person. To test this hypothesis, we conducted afunctional magnetic resonance imaging experiment with 11 pairs of romanticpartners while they viewed an evaluation of a target person (self, partner[intimate other], or stranger [non-intimate other]), made by other evaluators.When compared with strangers, viewing evaluations of self and partner activatedoverlapping regions in the medial prefrontal cortex. Verbal reputation ofself-specific activation was found in the precuneus, which representsself-related processing. The data suggest that midline structures representreputation of self. In addition, intimacy-modulated activation in the medialprefrontal cortex suggests that the verbal reputation of intimate others isrepresented similarly to reputation of self. These results suggest that thereputation representation in the medial prefrontal cortex is engaged by verbalreputation of self and intimate others stemming from both own and otherevaluators' judgments.
 Hippocampal dysfunction is known to be associated with several neurological andneuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, schizophreniaand depression; therefore, there has been significant clinical interest instudying hippocampal neurochemistry. However, the hippocampus is a challengingregion to study using (1) H MRS, hence the use of MRS for clinical research inthis region has been limited. Our goal was therefore to investigate thefeasibility of obtaining high-quality hippocampal spectra that allow reliablequantification of a neurochemical profile and to establish inter-sessionreproducibility of hippocampal MRS, including reproducibility of voxel placement,spectral quality and neurochemical concentrations. Ten healthy volunteers werescanned in two consecutive sessions using a standard clinical 3 T MR scanner.Neurochemical profiles were obtained with a short-echo (T(E) = 28 ms) semi-LASER localization sequence from a relatively small (~4 mL) voxel that covered about62% of the hippocampal volume as calculated from segmentation of T1 -weightedimages. Voxel composition was highly reproducible between sessions, withtest-retest coefficients of variation (CVs) of 3.5% and 7.5% for gray and whitematter volume fraction, respectively. Excellent signal-to-noise ratio (~54 based on the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) methyl peak in non-apodized spectra) andlinewidths (~9 Hz for water) were achieved reproducibly in all subjects. Thespectral quality allowed quantification of NAA, total choline, total creatine,myo-inositol and glutamate with high scan-rescan reproducibility (CV </= 6%) and quantification precision (Cramer-Rao lower bound, CRLB < 9%). Four othermetabolites, including glutathione and glucose, were quantified with scan-rescan CV below 20%. Therefore, the highly optimized, short-echo semi-LASER sequencetogether with FASTMAP shimming substantially improved the reproducibility andnumber of quantifiable metabolites relative to prior reports. In addition, thebetween-session variation in metabolite concentrations, as well as CRLB, waslower than the between-subject variation of the concentrations for mostmetabolites, indicating that the method has the sensitivity to detectinter-individual differences in the healthy brain.
 In the present research, we manipulated the perceived superior/inferior statusduring a competitive cognitive task. In two experiments, we created an explicitand strongly reinforced social hierarchy based on incidental rating on anattentional task. Based on our hypotheses, social rank may influence nonverbalcues (such as facial mimic related to emotional response), cortical lateralizedactivity in frontal areas (brain oscillations), and cognitive outcomes inresponse to rank modulation. Thus, the facial mimic (corrugators vs. zygomaticmuscle activity), frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta), and real cognitiveperformance [(error rate (ER); response times (RTs)] were considered.Specifically, a peer-group comparison was enrolled and an improved (experiment 1,N = 29) or decreased (experiment 2, N = 31) performance was artificiallymanipulated by the experimenter. Results showed a significant improved cognitive performance (decreased ER and RTs), an increased zygomatic activity (positiveemotions), and a more prefrontal left-lateralized cortical response in the caseof a perceived increased social ranking. On the contrary, a significant decreasedcognitive performance (increased ER and RTs), an increased corrugators activity(negative emotions), and a less left-lateralized cortical response were observed as a consequence of a perceived decreased social ranking. Moreover, thecorrelational values revealed a consistent trend between behavioral (RTs) and EMGand EEG measures for both experiments. The present results suggest that socialstatus not only guides social behavior, but it also influences cognitiveprocesses and subjects' performance.
 Event-related potential (ERP) approaches to social cognitive and affectiveneuroscience (SCAN) are not as widely used as other neuroimaging techniques, yet they offer several unique advantages. In particular, the high temporal resolutionof ERP measures of neural activity make them ideally suited for studying thedynamic interplay of rapidly unfolding cognitive and affective processes. In thisarticle, we highlight the utility of ERP methods for scientists investigatingquestions of SCAN. We begin with a brief description of the physiological basisof ERPs and discussion of methodological practices. We then discuss how ERPs may be used to address a range of questions concerning social perception, socialcognition, attitudes, affect and self-regulation, with examples of research that has used the ERP approach to contribute important theoretical advances in theseareas. Whether used alone or in combination with other techniques, the ERP is an indispensable part of the social and affective neuroscientist's methodologicaltoolkit.
 Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated brainactivity in an observer who watched the hand and arm motions of an individualwhen that individual was, or was not, the cause of the motion. Subjects viewed a realistic animated 3D character who sat at a table containing four pistons. OnIntended Motion trials, the character raised his hand and arm upwards. OnUnintended Motion trials, the piston under one of the character's hands pushedthe hand and arm upward with the same motion. Finally, during Non-BiologicalMotion control trials, a piston pushed a coffee mug upward in the same smoothmotion. Hand and arm motions, regardless of intention, evoked significantly more activity than control trials in a bilateral region that extended ventrally fromthe posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) region and which was more spatiallyextensive in the right hemisphere. The left pSTS near the temporal-parietaljunction, robustly differentiated between the Intended Motion and UnintendedMotion conditions. Here, strong activity was observed for Intended Motion trials,while Unintended Motion trials evoked similar activity as the coffee mug trials. Our results demonstrate a strong hemispheric bias in the role of the pSTS in the perception of causality of biological motion.
 Hypothetical reports of intended behavior are commonly used to draw conclusionsabout real choices. A fundamental question in decision neuroscience is whetherthe same type of valuation and choice computations are performed in hypothetical and real decisions. We investigated this question using functional magneticresonance imaging while human subjects made real and hypothetical choices aboutpurchases of consumer goods. We found that activity in common areas of theorbitofrontal cortex and the ventral striatum correlated with behavioral measuresof the stimulus value of the goods in both types of decision. Furthermore, wefound that activity in these regions was stronger in response to the stimulusvalue signals in the real choice condition. The findings suggest that thedifference between real and hypothetical choice is primarily attributable tovariations in the value computations of the medial orbitofrontal cortex and theventral striatum, and not attributable to the use of different valuation systems,or to the computation of stronger stimulus value signals in the hypotheticalcondition.
 Essential tremor (ET), clinically characterized by postural and kinetic tremors, predominantly in the upper extremities, originates from pathological activity in the dynamic oscillatory network comprising the majority of nodes in the centralmotor network. Evidence indicates dysfunction in the thalamus, theolivocerebellar loops, and intermittent cortical engagement. Pathology of thecerebellum, a structure with architecture intrinsically predisposed tooscillatory activity, has also been implicated in ET as shown by clinical,neuroimaging, and pathological studies. Despite electrophysiological studiesassessing cerebellar impairment in ET being scarce, their impact is tangible, as summarized in this review. The electromyography-magnetoencephalographycombination provided the first direct evidence of pathological alteration incortico-subcortical communication, with a significant emphasis on the cerebellum.Furthermore, complex electromyography studies showed disruptions in the timing ofagonist and antagonist muscle activation, a process generally attributed to thecerebellum. Evidence pointing to cerebellar engagement in ET has also been found in electrooculography measurements, cerebellar repetitive transcranial magneticstimulation studies, and, indirectly, in complex analyses of the activity of the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus (an area primarily receiving inputs fromthe cerebellum), which is also used in the advanced treatment of ET. In summary, further progress in therapy will require comprehensive electrophysiological andphysiological analyses to elucidate the precise mechanisms leading to diseasesymptoms. The cerebellum, as a major node of this dynamic oscillatory network,requires further study to aid this endeavor.
 The present study recorded event-related potentials using rapid serial visualpresentation paradigm to explore the time course of emotionally charged pictures.Participants completed a dual-target task as quickly and accurately as possible, in which they were asked to judge the gender of the person depicted (task 1) and the valence (positive, neutral, or negative) of the given picture (task 2). Theresults showed that the amplitudes of the P2 component were larger for emotional pictures than they were for neutral pictures, and this finding represents brainprocesses that distinguish emotional stimuli from non-emotional stimuli.Furthermore, positive, neutral, and negative pictures elicited late positivepotentials with different amplitudes, implying that the differences betweenemotions are recognized. Additionally, the time course for emotional pictureprocessing was consistent with the latter two stages of a three-stage modelderived from studies on emotional facial expression processing and emotionaladjective processing. The results of the present study indicate that in thethree-stage model of emotion processing, the middle and late stages are moreuniversal and stable, and thus occur at similar time points when using different stimuli (faces, words, or scenes).
 Retrospective and prospective studies consistently show that individuals exposed to human-generated traumatic events carry a higher risk of developingPosttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) than those exposed to other kinds of events.These studies also consistently identify perceptions of social support bothbefore and after a traumatic event as an important factor in the determiningvulnerability to the development of PTSD. We review the literature oninterpersonal traumas, social support and risk for PTSD and integrate findingswith recent advances in developmental psychopathology, attachment theory andsocial neuroscience. We propose and gather evidence for what we term the socialecology of PTSD, a conceptual framework for understanding how both PTSD risk and recovery are highly dependent on social phenomena. We explore clinicalimplications of this conceptual framework.
 Psychiatric disorders can affect our ability to successfully and enjoyablyinteract with others. Conversely, having difficulties in social relations isknown to increase the risk of developing a psychiatric disorder. In this article,the assumption that psychiatric disorders can be construed as disorders of socialinteraction is reviewed from a clinical point of view. Furthermore, it is argued that a psychiatrically motivated focus on the dynamics of social interaction may help to provide new perspectives for the field of social neuroscience. Suchprogress may be crucial to realize social neuroscience's translational potential and to advance the transdiagnostic investigation of the neurobiology ofpsychiatric disorders.
 The retention of first-order theory of mind (ToM) despite severe loss of grammar has been reported in two patients with left hemisphere brain damage (Varley &Siegal, 2000; Varley, Siegal, & Want, 2001). We report a third, and moredetailed, case study. Patient PH shows significant general language impairment,and severe grammatical impairment similar to that reported in previous studies.In addition we were able to show that PH's impairment extends to grammaticalconstructions most closely related to ToM in studies of children (embeddedcomplement clauses and relative clauses). Despite this, PH performed almostperfectly on first-order false belief tasks and on a novel nonverbal second-orderfalse belief task. PH was also successful on a novel test of "ToM semantics" thatrequired evaluation of the certainty implied by different mental state terms. Thedata strongly suggest that grammar is not a necessary source of structure forexplicit ToM reasoning in adults, but do not rule out a critical role for "ToMsemantics." In turn this suggests that the relationship observed between grammar and ToM in studies of children is the result of an exclusively developmentalprocess.
 BACKGROUND: Although a large number of functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) studies have investigated the neural bases of empathy, little is knownabout its spatiotemporal dynamics or its modulation by the level of friendshipbetween the observer and the agent who is being hurt. Moreover, most of theprevious studies on empathy have focused on empathy for pain rather than empathy for positive emotions, such as happiness. In the present study, we addressed thisquestion by investigating the spatiotemporal brain dynamics of two differentkinds of empathy (empathy for pain, empathy for happiness) with a behavioralpriming empathy task involving two different level of primes (a close friend, astranger). METHOD/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Electrical brain activity and behavioraldata were analyzed from 30 subjects (12 males and 18 females). Half of thesubjects performed a behavioral task on empathy for pain task (EPT), while theother half performed a behavioral task on empathy for happiness task (EHT). Ineach task, participants viewed prime photographs of either: (1) a stranger; or(2) a close friend (primes) followed by target photographs showing either a hand being hurt (or not; targets in the EPT), or a hand in happy circumstances (ornot; targets in the EHT). In each task, participants were asked to judge thetarget situation and report whether they could feel the pain (in EPT) or thehappiness (in the EHT), as a function of the primes i.e., either from the closefriend's or from the stranger's perspective. Although our behavioral resultsdidn't reveal any explicit differences among the different types of primes withineach task, our electrophysiological results showed variations as a function ofthe primes. First, a early smaller N110 amplitude for pain was observed in theanterior prefrontal cortex during the friend prime condition compared to thestranger prime condition. No similar early effects were found for happiness. Onthe other hand, both empathy for happiness (EHT) and empathy for pain (EPT)elicited later differences. In the EPT, the friend prime elicited a larger latepositive potential (LPP) than the stranger prime. In the EHT, the friend primeelicited a larger N250, a smaller P300, and a smaller LPP than the strangerprime. CONCLUSIONS: Taking the perspective of a close friend (as a primestimulus) does have a dual-stage effect on empathy that is characterized by anearly modulation for pain and later modulations for both pain and happiness. The early differences between friend and stranger primes for pain (but not forhappiness) suggest that empathy for pain is an automatic process that has beensocially learned and passed among friends. On the other hand, the laterdifferences observed between stranger and friend prime suggest that additionalcognitive appraisal take place for both pain and happiness. Our results suggestthat it takes more cognitive attentional efforts to judge a stranger's happiness than a friend's happiness, whereas the opposite is true for pain. These findings open new avenues toward a better understanding of the empathic mind.
 Bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by evidence of seizure onsetindependently in both temporal lobes. The main aim of the present study was todetermine whether patients with evidence of independent bilateral temporal lobeepilepsy (biTLE) can be identified noninvasively on the basis of seizuresemiology analysis. Thirteen patients with biTLE, as defined by invasive EEG,were matched with 13 patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (uniTLE). Inall 26 patients, the frequency of predefined clusters of ictal and periictalsigns were evaluated: ictal motor signs (IMSs), periictal motor signs (PIMSs),periictal vegetative signs (PIVSs), the frequency of early oroalimentaryautomatisms (EOAs), and the duration of postictal unresponsiveness (PU). Someother noninvasive and clinical data were also evaluated. A lower frequency ofIMSs was noted in the group with biTLE (patients = 46.2%, seizures = 20.7%) than in the group with uniTLE (patients = 92.3%, seizures = 61.0%) (p = 0.030; p <0.001, respectively). The individual IMS average per seizure was significantlylower in the group with biTLE (0.14; range = 0-1.0) than in the group with uniTLE(0.80; range = 0-2.6) (p = 0.003). Postictal unresponsiveness was longer than 5min in more patients (75.0%) and seizures (42.9%) in the group with biTLE than inthe group with uniTLE (patients = 30.8%, seizures = 18.6%) (p = 0.047; p =0.002). The frequency of EOAs, PIMSs, PIVSs, and other clinical data did notdiffer significantly. There is a lower frequency of ictal motor signs and longer duration of postictal unresponsiveness in patients with biTLE.
 The influence of prior exposure to disgusting imagery and the conscious appraisalof facial expressions were examined in an event-related potential (ERP)experiment. Participants were exposed to either a disgust or a controlmanipulation and then presented with emotional and neutral expressions. Anassessment of the gender of the face was required during half the blocks and anaffective assessment of the emotion in the other half. The emotion-related early posterior negativity (EPN) and late positive potential (LPP) ERP components were examined for disgust and neutral stimuli. Results indicated that the EPN wasenhanced for disgusted over neutral expressions. Prior disgust exposure modulatedthe middle phase of the LPP in response to disgusted but not neutral expressions,but only when the emotion of the face was explicitly evaluated. The late LPP was enhanced independently of stimuli when an emotional decision was made. Resultsdemonstrated that exposure to disgusting imagery can affect the subsequentprocessing of disgusted facial expressions when the emotion is under consciousappraisal.
 Covert exchange of autonomic responses may shape social affective behavior, asobserved in mirroring of pupillary responses during sadness processing. Weexamined how, independent of facial emotional expression, dynamic coherencebetween one's own and another's pupil size modulates regional brain activity.Fourteen subjects viewed pairs of eye stimuli while undergoing fMRI. Usingcontinuous pupillometry biofeedback, the size of the observed pupils was varied, correlating positively or negatively with changes in participants' own pupils.Viewing both static and dynamic stimuli activated right fusiform gyrus. Observingdynamically changing pupils activated STS and amygdala, regions engaged bynon-static and salient facial features. Discordance between observed andobserver's pupillary changes enhanced activity within bilateral anterior insula, left amygdala and anterior cingulate. In contrast, processing positivelycorrelated pupils enhanced activity within left frontal operculum. Our findingssuggest pupillary signals are monitored continuously during social interactionsand that incongruent changes activate brain regions involved in trackingmotivational salience and attentionally meaningful information. Naturalistically,dynamic coherence in pupillary change follows fluctuations in ambient light.Correspondingly, in social contexts discordant pupil response is likely toreflect divergence of dispositional state. Our data provide empirical evidencefor an autonomically mediated extension of forward models of motor control intosocial interaction.
 Decision neuroscience offers the potential for decomposing differences inbehavior across individuals into components of valuation intimately tied to brainfunction. One application of this approach lies in novel conceptualizations ofbehavioral attributes that are aberrant in psychiatric disorders. We investigatedthe relationship between social anxiety and behavior in a novel sociallydetermined risk task. Behaviorally, higher scores on a social phobia inventory(SPIN) among healthy participants were associated with an increase in riskyresponses. Furthermore, activity in a region of the dorsal anterior insula (dAI) scaled in proportion to SPIN score in risky versus non-risky choices. This regionof the insula was functionally connected to areas in the intraparietal sulcus andanterior cingulate cortex that were related to decision-making across allparticipants. Overall, social anxiety was associated with decreased risk aversionin our task, consistent with previous results investigating risk taking in manyeveryday behaviors. Moreover, this difference was linked to the anterior insula, a region commonly implicated in risk attitudes and socio-emotional processes.
 Over the past two decades, the question of how our brain makes us sensitive tothe state of conspecifics and how that affects our behaviour has undergone aprofound change. Twenty years ago what would now be called social neurosciencewas focused on the visual processing of facial expressions and body movements in temporal lobe structures of primates (Puce and Perrett 2003). With the discovery of mirror neurons, this changed rapidly towards the modern field of socialneuroscience, in which high-level vision is but one of many focuses of interest. In this essay, we will argue that for the further progress of the field, theintegration of animal neuroscience and human neuroscience is paramount. We willdo so, by focusing on the field of embodied social cognition. We will first show how the combination of animal and human neuroscience was critical in how thediscovery of mirror neurons placed the motor system on the map of socialcognition. We will then argue why an integrated cross-species approach will bepivotal to our understanding of the neural basis of emotional empathy and itslink to prosocial behaviour.
 Incremental learning, in which new knowledge is acquired gradually through trial and error, can be distinguished from one-shot learning, in which the brain learnsrapidly from only a single pairing of a stimulus and a consequence. Very littleis known about how the brain transitions between these two fundamentallydifferent forms of learning. Here we test a computational hypothesis thatuncertainty about the causal relationship between a stimulus and an outcomeinduces rapid changes in the rate of learning, which in turn mediates thetransition between incremental and one-shot learning. By using a novel behavioraltask in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data fromhuman volunteers, we found evidence implicating the ventrolateral prefrontalcortex and hippocampus in this process. The hippocampus was selectively"switched" on when one-shot learning was predicted to occur, while theventrolateral prefrontal cortex was found to encode uncertainty about the causal association, exhibiting increased coupling with the hippocampus for high-learningrates, suggesting this region may act as a "switch," turning on and off one-shot learning as required.
 Subcortical auditory nuclei were traditionally viewed as non-plastic in adulthoodso that acoustic information could be stably conveyed to higher auditory areas.Studies in a variety of species, including humans, now suggest that prolongedacoustic training can drive long-lasting brainstem plasticity. Theneurobiological mechanisms for such changes are not well understood in naturalbehavioral contexts due to a relative dearth of in vivo animal models in which tostudy this. Here, we demonstrate in a mouse model that a natural life experience with increased demands on the auditory system - motherhood - is associated withimproved temporal processing in the subcortical auditory pathway. We measured theauditory brainstem response to test whether mothers and pup-naive virgin micediffered in temporal responses to both broadband and tone stimuli, includingultrasonic frequencies found in mouse pup vocalizations. Mothers had shorterlatencies for early ABR peaks, indicating plasticity in the auditory nerve andthe cochlear nucleus. Shorter interpeak latency between waves IV and V alsosuggest plasticity in the inferior colliculus. Hormone manipulations revealedthat these cannot be explained solely by estrogen levels experienced duringpregnancy and parturition in mothers. In contrast, we found that pup-careexperience, independent of pregnancy and parturition, contributes to shorteningauditory brainstem response latencies. These results suggest that acousticexperience in the maternal context imparts plasticity on early auditoryprocessing that lasts beyond pup weaning. In addition to establishing an animalmodel for exploring adult auditory brainstem plasticity in a neuroethologicalcontext, our results have broader implications for models of perceptual,behavioral and neural changes that arise during maternity, where subcorticalsensorineural plasticity has not previously been considered.
 Although cognitive neuroscience has made remarkable progress in understanding theinvolvement of the prefrontal cortex in executive control, the broader functionalnetworks that support high-level cognition and give rise to general intelligence remain to be well characterized. Here, we investigated the neural substrates ofthe general factor of intelligence (g) and executive function in 182 patientswith focal brain damage using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. The WechslerAdult Intelligence Scale and Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System were used to derive measures of g and executive function, respectively. Impaired performanceon these measures was associated with damage to a distributed network of leftlateralized brain areas, including regions of frontal and parietal cortex andwhite matter association tracts, which bind these areas into a coordinatedsystem. The observed findings support an integrative framework for understanding the architecture of general intelligence and executive function, supporting theirreliance upon a shared fronto-parietal network for the integration and control ofcognitive representations and making specific recommendations for the applicationof the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and Delis-Kaplan Executive FunctionSystem to the study of high-level cognition in health and disease.
 We present here the concept of rational emotions: Emotions may be directlycontrolled and utilized in a conscious, analytic fashion, enabling an individual to size up a situation, to determine that a certain "mental state" isstrategically advantageous and adjust accordingly. Building on the growing bodyof literature recognizing the vital role of emotions in determining decisions, weexplore the complementary role of rational choice in choosing emotional states.Participants played the role of "recipient" in the dictator game, in which ananonymous "dictator" decides how to split an amount of money between himself and the recipient. A subset of recipients was given a monetary incentive to be angry at low-split offers. That subset demonstrated increased physiological arousal at low offers relative to high offers as well as more anger than other participants.These results provide a fresh outlook on human decision-making and contribute to the continuing effort to build more complete models of rational behavior.
 Humans have the striking capacity to predict actions performed by theirconspecifics. But how exactly do we perform such predictions? Do we use our ownaction repertoire and our own body to simulate the reaching range of others? Inthis functional magnetic resonance imaging study static photographs depictingside views of seated human models were presented to participants, who had topredict whether the models could reach a target placed in front of them. Thepredictions were performed both fast and accurate, but with an overestimationbias as well as higher error rates and slower predictions for targets close tothe models' actual reaching ranges. Specific hemodynamic signal changes weredetected in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, inferior and superiorparietal areas, and in right ventral premotor cortex. These findings demonstrate that action prediction in the current context activates a network of areasinvolved in action recognition, visuo-spatial transformation and somatosensoryanticipation. The results are in line with the mirror-neuron system account ofaction understanding and the notion of the common coding theory that actions are coded in terms of their perceivable effects.
 BACKGROUND: Although dystonia is traditionally conceptualized as a basal ganglia disorder, increasing interest has been directed at a different neural networknode, the cerebellum, which may play a significant role in the pathophysiology ofdystonia. Abnormal sensorimotor processing and disturbed motor schemes, possibly attributable to cerebellar changes, remain unclear. METHODS: We sought tocharacterize the extent of cerebellar dysfunction within the motor network using functional MRI activation analysis, connectivity analysis, and voxel-basedmorphometry in cervical dystonia patients (n = 25, 15 women, mean age 45.8 years)and healthy volunteers (n = 25, 15 women, mean age 44.7 years) in a visuospatial task requiring predictive motor timing. RESULTS: Cervical dystonia patientsshowed decreased activation in the posterior cerebellar lobules as well as in thepremotor areas, the associative parietal cortex, and visual regions. Patientsalso had decreased cerebellar connectivity with bilateral basal gangliastructures and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: This promotes theview that dystonia results from miscommunication between the basal ganglia andcerebellar loops, thus providing new insights into the brain regions essentialfor the development of cervical dystonia.

 Recent studies of political behavior suggest that voting decisions can beinfluenced substantially by "first-impression" social attributions based onphysical appearance. Separate lines of research have implicated the orbitofrontalcortex (OFC) in the judgment of social traits on the one hand and economicdecision-making on the other, making this region a plausible candidate forlinking social attributions to voting decisions. Here, we asked whether OFClesions in humans disrupted the ability to judge traits of political candidatesor affected how these judgments influenced voting decisions. Seven patients with lateral OFC damage, 18 patients with frontal damage sparing the lateral OFC, and 53 matched healthy participants took part in a simulated election paradigm, inwhich they voted for real-life (but unknown) candidates based only on photographsof their faces. Consistent with previous work, attributions of "competence" and"attractiveness" based on candidate appearance predicted voting behavior in thehealthy control group. Frontal damage did not affect substantially the ability tomake competence or attractiveness judgments, but patients with damage to thelateral OFC differed from other groups in how they applied this information when voting. Only attractiveness ratings had any predictive power for voting choicesafter lateral OFC damage, whereas other frontal patients and healthy controlsrelied on information about both competence and attractiveness in making theirchoice. An intact lateral OFC may not be necessary for judgment of social traits based on physical appearance, but it seems to be crucial in applying thisinformation in political decision-making.
 The social motivation hypothesis posits that aberrant neural response to humanfaces in autism is attributable to atypical social development and consequentlyreduced exposure to faces. The specificity of deficits in neural specializationremains unclear, and alternative theories suggest generalized processingdifficulties. The current study contrasted neural specialization for socialinformation versus nonsocial information in 36 individuals with autism and 18typically developing individuals matched for age, race, sex, handedness, andcognitive ability. Event-related potentials elicited by faces, inverted faces,houses, letters, and pseudoletters were recorded. Groups were compared on anelectrophysiological marker of neural specialization (N170), as well asbehavioral performance on standardized measures of face recognition and wordreading/decoding. Consistent with prior results, individuals with autismdisplayed slowed face processing and decreased sensitivity to face inversion;however, they showed comparable brain responses to letters, which were associatedwith behavioral performance in both groups. Results suggest that individuals withautism display atypical neural specialization for social information but intactspecialization for nonsocial information. Findings concord with the notion ofspecific dysfunction in social brain systems rather than nonspecificinformation-processing difficulties in autism.
 The phenomenon of empathy entails the ability to share the affective experiences of others. In recent years social neuroscience made considerable progress inrevealing the mechanisms that enable a person to feel what another is feeling.The present review provides an in-depth and critical discussion of thesefindings. Consistent evidence shows that sharing the emotions of others isassociated with activation in neural structures that are also active during thefirst-hand experience of that emotion. Part of the neural activation sharedbetween self- and other-related experiences seems to be rather automaticallyactivated. However, recent studies also show that empathy is a highly flexiblephenomenon, and that vicarious responses are malleable with respect to a numberof factors--such as contextual appraisal, the interpersonal relationship between empathizer and other, or the perspective adopted during observation of the other.Future investigations are needed to provide more detailed insights into thesefactors and their neural underpinnings. Questions such as whether individualdifferences in empathy can be explained by stable personality traits, whether we can train ourselves to be more empathic, and how empathy relates to prosocialbehavior are of utmost relevance for both science and society.
 To explore how cultural immersion modulates emotion processing, this studyexamined how Chinese immigrants to Canada process multisensory emotionalexpressions, which were compared to existing data from two groups, Chinese andNorth Americans. Stroop and Oddball paradigms were employed to examine different stages of emotion processing. The Stroop task presented face-voice pairsexpressing congruent/incongruent emotions and participants actively judged theemotion of one modality while ignoring the other. A significant effect ofcultural immersion was observed in the immigrants' behavioral performance, which showed greater interference from to-be-ignored faces, comparable with what wasobserved in North Americans. However, this effect was absent in their N400 data, which retained the same pattern as the Chinese. In the Oddball task, whereimmigrants passively viewed facial expressions with/without simultaneous vocalemotions, they exhibited a larger visual MMN for faces accompanied by voices,again mirroring patterns observed in Chinese. Correlation analyses indicated thatthe immigrants' living duration in Canada was associated with neural patterns(N400 and visual mismatch negativity) more closely resembling North Americans.Our data suggest that in multisensory emotion processing, adopting to a newculture first leads to behavioral accommodation followed by alterations in brain activities, providing new evidence on human's neurocognitive plasticity incommunication.
 In this paired article the authors review research on paid work, parenting, andhealth in order to isolate fundamental questions and issues that remainunaddressed. Next, consistent with the theme of this special issue, the authorsintroduce social neuroscience and highlight how this emerging multidisciplinaryscience offers substantial promise for advancing key unresolved issues in thepaid work, parenting, and health literature. The article concludes withsuggestions for promising areas of research wherein family scientists and social neuroscientists could build collaborative research to address gaps in thework-family literature.
 Most instances of social interaction provide a wealth of information about thestates of other people, be it sensations, feelings, thoughts, or convictions. Howwe represent these states has been a major question in social neuroscience,leading to the identification of two routes to understanding others: an affectiveroute for the direct sharing of others' emotions (empathy) that involves, amongothers, anterior insula and middle anterior cingulate cortex and a cognitiveroute for representing and reasoning about others' states (Theory of Mind) thatentails, among others, ventral temporoparietal junction and anterior andposterior midline regions. Additionally, research has revealed a number ofsituational and personal factors that shape the functioning of empathy and Theoryof Mind. Concerning situational modulators, it has been shown, for instance, thatingroup membership enhances empathic responding and that Theory of Mindperformance seems to be susceptible to stress. Personal modulators includepsychopathological conditions, for which alterations in empathy and mentalizinghave consistently been demonstrated; people on the autism spectrum, for instance,are impaired specifically in mentalizing, while spontaneous empathic respondingseems selectively reduced in psychopathy. Given the multifaceted evidence forseparability of the two routes, current research endeavors aiming at fosteringinterpersonal cooperation explore the differential malleability of affective and cognitive understanding of others.
 In this paper, we argue for a stronger engagement between concepts in affectiveand social neuroscience on the one hand, and theories from the fields ofanthropology, economics, political science, and sociology on the other. Affectiveand social neuroscience could provide an additional assessment of socialtheories. We argue that some of the most influential social theories of the last four decades-rational choice theory, behavioral economics, andpost-structuralism-contain assumptions that are inconsistent with key findings inaffective and social neuroscience. We also show that another approach from thesocial sciences-plural rationality theory-shows greater compatibility with these findings. We further claim that, in their turn, social theories can strengthenaffective and social neuroscience. The former can provide more preciseformulations of the social phenomena that neuroscientific models have targeted,can help neuroscientists who build these models become more aware of their socialand cultural biases, and can even improve the models themselves. To illustrate,we show how plural rationality theory can be used to further specify and test thesomatic marker hypothesis. Thus, we aim to accelerate the much-needed merger ofsocial theories with affective and social neuroscience.
 The goal was to develop quantitative models of the neurodynamic organizations of teams that could be used for comparing performance within and across teams andsessions. A symbolic modeling system was developed, where rawelectroencephalography (EEG) signals from dyads were first transformed intosecond-by-second estimates of the cognitive Workload or Engagement of each personand transformed again into symbols representing the aggregated levels of theteam. The resulting neurodynamic symbol streams had a persistent structure andcontained segments of differential symbol expression. The quantitative Shannonentropy changes during these periods were related to speech, performance, andteam responses to task changes. The dyads in an unscripted map navigation task(Human Communication Research Centre (HCRC) Map Task (MT)) developed fluctuating dynamics for Workload and Engagement, as they established their teamwork rhythms,and these were disrupted by external changes to the task. The entropyfluctuations during these disruptions differed in frequency, magnitude, andduration, and were associated with qualitative and quantitative changes in teamorganization and performance. These results indicate that neurodynamic models maybe reliable, sensitive, and valid indicators of the changing neurodynamics ofteams around which standardized quantitative models can begin to be developed.
 Romantic love has been the source for some of the greatest achievements ofmankind throughout the ages. The recent localization of romantic love withinsubcortico-cortical reward, motivation and emotion systems in the human brain hassuggested that love is a goal-directed drive with predictable facilitationeffects on cognitive behavior, rather than a pure emotion. Here we show that the subliminal exposure of a beloved's name (romantic prime) during a lexicaldecision task dramatically improves performance in women in love (Experiment 1), as the subliminal presentation of a passion's descriptive noun does (Experiment2). The parallel between love and passion allows us to interpret thesefacilitation effects as corresponding to cognitive top-down processes within amotivation-enhanced neural network.
 Autism is a developmental condition, characterized by difficulties of socialinteraction and communication, as well as restricted interests and repetitivebehaviors. Although several important conceptions have shed light on specificfacets, there is still no consensus about a universal yet specific theory interms of its underlying mechanisms. While some theories have exclusively focused on sensory aspects, others have emphasized social difficulties. However, sensory and social processes in autism might be interconnected to a higher degree thanwhat has been traditionally thought. We propose that a mismatch in sensoryabilities across individuals can lead to difficulties on a social, i.e.interpersonal level and vice versa. In this article, we, therefore, selectivelyreview evidence indicating an interrelationship between perceptual and socialdifficulties in autism. Additionally, we link this body of research with studies,which investigate the mechanisms of action control in social contexts. By doingso, we highlight that autistic traits are also crucially related to differencesin integration, anticipation and automatic responding to social cues, rather thana mere inability to register and learn from social cues. Importantly, suchdifferences may only manifest themselves in sufficiently complex situations, suchas real-life social interactions, where such processes are inextricably linked.
 The social neuroscientific investigation of empathy has revealed that the sameneural networks engaged during first-hand experience of affect subserve empathic responses. Recent meta-analyses focusing on empathy for pain for example reliablyidentified a network comprising anterior insula and anterior midcingulate cortex.Moreover, recent studies suggest that the generation of empathy is flexiblysupported by networks involved in action simulation and mentalizing depending on the information available in the environment. Further, empathic responses aremodulated by many factors including the context they occur in. Recent work shows how this modulation can be afforded by the engagement of antagonisticmotivational systems or by cognitive control circuits, and these modulatorysystems can also be employed in efforts to regulate one's empathic responses.
 The current study aimed to systematically investigate genetic and neuroanatomicalcorrelates of individual variation in scratching behaviors, a well-validatedanimal-behavioral indicator of negative emotional states with clear links to the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) response to potential harm ("anxiety")construct within the Negative Valence Systems domain. Utilizing data from asample of 76 captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), we (a) examined theassociation between scratching and presence or absence of the RS3-containing DupBelement in the AVPR1A 5' flanking region, (b) utilized voxel-based morphometry(VBM) to identify gray matter (GM) voxel clusters that differentiated AVPR1Agenotype, and (c) conducted a VBM-guided voxel-of-interest analysis to examinethe association between GM intensity and scratching. AVPR1A evidenced sexuallydimorphic associations with scratching. VBM analyses revealed significantdifferences in GM by genotype across twelve clusters largely in the frontalcortex. Regions differentiating AVPR1A genotype showed sex-specific associations with scratching. Results suggest that sexually dimorphic associations betweenAVPR1A and scratching may be explained by genotype-specific neuroanatomicalvariation. The current study provides an example of the way in which chimpanzeeresearch is uniquely poised for multilevel, systematic investigations ofpsychopathology-relevant constructs within the context of the RDoC framework.
 Vul, Harris, Winkielman, and Pashler (2009), (this issue) claim that manybrain-personality correlations in fMRI studies are "likely ... spurious" (p.274), and "should not be believed" (p. 285). Several of their conclusions areincorrect. First, they incorrectly claim that whole-brain regressions use aninvalid and "nonindependent" two-step inferential procedure, a determinationbased on a survey sent to researchers that only included nondiagnostic questions about the descriptive process of plotting one's data. We explain how whole-brain regressions are a valid single-step method of identifying brain regions that havereliable correlations with individual difference measures. Second, they claimthat large correlations from whole-brain regression analyses may be the result ofnoise alone. We provide a simulation to demonstrate that typical fMRI samplesizes will only rarely produce large correlations in the absence of any trueeffect. Third, they claim that the reported correlations are inflated to thepoint of being "implausibly high." Though biased post hoc correlation estimatesare a well-known consequence of conducting multiple tests, Vul et al. makeinaccurate assumptions when estimating the theoretical ceiling of suchcorrelations. Moreover, their own "meta-analysis suggests that the magnitude ofthe bias is approximately .12-a rather modest bias.
 This paper discusses the relevance of the discovery of mirror neurons in monkeys and of the mirror neuron system in humans to a neuroscientific account ofprimates' social cognition and its evolution. It is proposed that mirror neurons and the functional mechanism they underpin, embodied simulation, can groundwithin a unitary neurophysiological explanatory framework important aspects ofhuman social cognition. In particular, the main focus is on language, hereconceived according to a neurophenomenological perspective, grounding meaning on the social experience of action. A neurophysiological hypothesis--the "neuralexploitation hypothesis"--is introduced to explain how key aspects of humansocial cognition are underpinned by brain mechanisms originally evolved forsensorimotor integration. It is proposed that these mechanisms were later onadapted as new neurofunctional architecture for thought and language, whileretaining their original functions as well. By neural exploitation, socialcognition and language can be linked to the experiential domain of action.
 Current accounts suggest that self-referential thought serves a pivotal function in the human ability to simulate the future during mind-wandering. Usingexperience sampling, this hypothesis was tested in two studies that explored the extent to which self-reflection impacts both retrospection and prospection duringmind-wandering. Study 1 demonstrated that a brief period of self-reflectionyielded a prospective bias during mind-wandering such that participants' engaged more frequently in spontaneous future than past thought. In Study 2, individualdifferences in the strength of self-referential thought - as indexed by thememorial advantage for self rather than other-encoded items - was shown to varywith future thinking during mind-wandering. Together these results confirm thatself-reflection is a core component of future thinking during mind-wandering and provide novel evidence that a key function of the autobiographical memory system may be to mentally simulate events in the future.
 "In vivo Brodmann mapping" or non-invasive cortical parcellation using MRI,especially by measuring cortical myelination, has recently become a popularresearch topic, though myeloarchitectonic cortical parcellation in humanspreviously languished in favor of cytoarchitecture. We review recent in vivomyelin mapping studies and discuss some of the different methods for estimatingmyelin content. We discuss some ways in which myelin maps may improve surfaceregistration and be useful for cross-modal and cross-species comparisons,including some preliminary cross-species results. Next, we considerneurobiological aspects of why some parts of cortex are more myelinated thanothers. Myelin content is inversely correlated with intracortical circuitcomplexity - in general, more myelin content means simpler and perhaps lessdynamic intracortical circuits. Using existing PET data and functional networkparcellations, we examine metabolic differences in the differently myelinatedcortical functional networks. Lightly myelinated cognitive association networkstend to have higher aerobic glycolysis than heavily myelinated earlysensory-motor ones, perhaps reflecting greater ongoing dynamic anabolic cortical processes. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that intracorticalmyelination may stabilize intracortical circuits and inhibit synaptic plasticity.Finally, we discuss the future of the in vivo myeloarchitectural field andcortical parcellation--"in vivo Brodmann mapping"--in general.
 People spontaneously mimic a variety of behaviors, including emotional facialexpressions. Embodied cognition theories suggest that mimicry reflects internalsimulation of perceived emotion in order to facilitate its understanding. If so, blocking facial mimicry should impair recognition of expressions, especially ofemotions that are simulated using facial musculature. The current research testedthis hypothesis using four expressions (happy, disgust, fear, and sad) and twomimicry-interfering manipulations (1) biting on a pen and (2) chewing gum, aswell as two control conditions. Experiment 1 used electromyography over cheek,mouth, and nose regions. The bite manipulation consistently activated assessedmuscles, whereas the chew manipulation activated muscles only intermittently.Further, expressing happiness generated most facial action. Experiment 2 foundthat the bite manipulation interfered most with recognition of happiness. Thesefindings suggest that facial mimicry differentially contributes to recognition ofspecific facial expressions, thus allowing for more refined predictions fromembodied cognition theories.
 Worldwide racial prejudice is originated from in-group/out-group discrimination. This prejudice can bias face perception at the very beginning of socialinteraction. However, little is known about the neurocognitive mechanismunderlying the influence of racial prejudice on facial emotion perception. Here, we examined the neural basis of disgust perception in racial prejudice using apassive viewing task and functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found thatcompared with the disgusted faces of in-groups, the disgusted faces of out-groupsresult in increased amygdala and insular engagement, positive coupling of theinsula with amygdala-based emotional system, and negative coupling of the insula with anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)-based regulatory system. Furthermore,machine-learning algorithms revealed that the level of implicit racial prejudice could be predicted by functional couplings of the insula with both the amygdalaand the ACC, which suggests that the insula is largely involved in raciallybiased disgust perception through two distinct neural circuits. In addition,individual difference in disgust sensitivity was found to be predictive ofimplicit racial prejudice. Taken together, our results suggest a crucial role of insula-centered circuits for disgust perception in racial prejudice.
 Neurophysiological and imaging studies have shown that seeing the actions ofother individuals brings about the vicarious activation of motor regions involvedin performing the same actions. While this suggests a simulative mechanismmediating the perception of others' actions, one cannot use such evidence to makeinferences about the functional significance of vicarious activations. Indeed, a central aim in social neuroscience is to comprehend how vicarious activationsallow the understanding of other people's behavior, and this requires to usestimulation or lesion methods to establish causal links from brain activity tocognitive functions. In the present work, we review studies investigating theeffects of transient manipulations of brain activity or stable lesions in themotor system on individuals' ability to perceive and understand the actions ofothers. We conclude there is now compelling evidence that neural activity in the motor system is critical for such cognitive ability. More research using causalmethods, however, is needed in order to disclose the limits and the conditionsunder which vicarious activations are required to perceive and understand actionsof others as well as their emotions and somatic feelings.
 Depression symptoms during pregnancy may affect emerging maternal sensitivity andhave lasting consequences for the dyadic relationship. Here, we examined whether depression was associated with the neural correlates of infant face and cryperception during pregnancy. In 36 women between 34 and 38 weeks gestation, weexamined the P300 elicited by infant emotional (happy, distressed, and neutral)faces and cries (high- and low-distress cries and a neutral tone). The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory-II were employed to measure current depression symptomatology. Higher depression symptoms wereassociated with an attenuated P300 to distressed infant faces, but not with happyor neutral infant faces. There was no association between depression symptoms andthe P300 elicited by infant cries. These results suggest that depression symptomsduring pregnancy may affect neural processing of infant faces, especially whenthe infant face is expressing distress.
 Gaze direction perception triggers rapid visuospatial orienting to the locationobserved by others. When this is congruent with the location of a target,reaction times are faster than when incongruent. Functional magnetic resonanceimaging studies suggest that the non-joint attention induced by incongruent cues are experienced as more emotionally negative and this could relate to lessfavorable trust judgments of the faces when gaze-cues are contingent withidentity. Here, we provide further support for these findings using time-resolvedevent-related potentials. In addition to replicating the effects ofidentity-contingent gaze-cues on reaction times and trust judgments, wediscovered that the emotion-related late positive potential increased acrossblocks to incongruent compared to congruent faces before, during and after thegaze-cue, suggesting both learning and retrieval of emotion states associatedwith the face. We also discovered that the face-recognition-related N250component appeared to localize to sources in anterior temporal areas. Ourfindings provide unique electrophysiological evidence for the role of emotion in learning trust from gaze-cues, suggesting that the retrieval of face evaluations during interaction may take around 1000 ms and that the N250 originates fromanterior temporal face patches.
 Consistent with social neuroscience perspectives on adolescent development,previous cross-sectional research has found diverging mean age-related trends forsensation seeking and impulsivity during adolescence. The present study useslongitudinal data on 7,640 youth from the National Longitudinal Study of YouthChildren and Young Adults, a nationally representative sample assessed bienniallyfrom 1994 to 2006. Latent growth curve models were used to investigate meanage-related changes in self-reports of impulsivity and sensation seeking fromages 12 to 24 years, as well individual differences in these changes. Three novelfindings are reported. First, impulsivity and sensation seeking showed diverging patterns of longitudinal change at the population level. Second, there wassubstantial person-to-person variation in the magnitudes of developmental change in both impulsivity and sensation seeking, with some teenagers showing rapidchanges as they matured and others maintaining relatively constant levels withage. Finally, the correlation between age-related changes in impulsivity andsensation seeking was modest and not significant. Together, these resultsconstitute the first support for the dual systems model of adolescent developmentto derive from longitudinal behavioral data.
 The thalamus is a relay center between various subcortical brain areas and thecerebral cortex with delineation of its constituent nuclei being of particularinterest in many applications. While previous studies have demonstrated efficacy of connectivity-based thalamus segmentation, they used approaches that do notconsider the dynamic nature of thalamo-cortical interactions. In this study, weexplicitly exploited the dynamic variation of thalamo-cortical connections toidentify different states of functional connectivity and performed state-specificthalamus parcellation. With normalized spectral clustering successively appliedin temporal and spatial domains, nine thalamo-cortical connectivity states wereidentified and the dynamic thalamus parcellation revealed finer thalamicstructures with improved atlas correspondence. The present results extend ourunderstanding of thalamo-cortical connectivity and provide a more comprehensiveview of the thalamo-cortical interaction.
 Effective coaching and mentoring is crucial to the success of individuals andorganizations, yet relatively little is known about its neural underpinnings.Coaching and mentoring to the Positive Emotional Attractor (PEA) emphasizescompassion for the individual's hopes and dreams and has been shown to enhance a behavioral change. In contrast, coaching to the Negative Emotional Attractor(NEA), by focusing on externally defined criteria for success and theindividual's weaknesses in relation to them, does not show sustained change. Weused fMRI to measure BOLD responses associated with these two coaching styles. Wehypothesized that PEA coaching would be associated with increased global visualprocessing and with engagement of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), whilethe NEA coaching would involve greater engagement of the sympathetic nervoussystem (SNS). Regions showing more activity in PEA conditions included thelateral occipital cortex, superior temporal cortex, medial parietal, subgenualcingulate, nucleus accumbens, and left lateral prefrontal cortex. We relate theseactivations to visioning, PNS activity, and positive affect. Regions showing moreactivity in NEA conditions included medial prefrontal regions and right lateralprefrontal cortex. We relate these activations to SNS activity, self-traitattribution and negative affect.
 Intelligent action entails exploiting predictions about associations betweenelements of ones environment. The hippocampus and mediotemporal cortex areendowed with the network topology, physiology, and neurochemistry toautomatically and sparsely code sensori-cognitive associations that can bereconstructed from single or partial inputs. Whilst acquiring fMRI data andperforming an attentional task, participants were incidentally presented with asequence of cartoon images. By assigning subjects a post-scan free-associationtask on the same images we assayed the density of associations triggered by thesestimuli. Using multivariate Bayesian decoding, we show that human hippocampal andtemporal neocortical structures host sparse associative representations that are automatically triggered by visual input. Furthermore, as predicted theoretically,there was a significant increase in sparsity in the Cornu Ammonis subfields,relative to the entorhinal cortex. Remarkably, the sparsity of CA encodingcorrelated significantly with associative memory performance over subjects;elsewhere within the temporal lobe, entorhinal, parahippocampal, perirhinal andfusiform cortices showed the highest model evidence for the sparse encoding ofassociative density. In the absence of reportability or attentional confounds,this charts a distribution of visual associative representations withinhippocampal populations and their temporal lobe afferent fields, and demonstratesthe viability of retrospective associative sampling techniques for assessing the form of reflexive associative encoding.
 Catecholamines, such as dopamine, are evolutionarily ancient neurotransmittersthat play an essential role in mediating behavior. In vertebrates, dopamine iscentral to the nigrostriatal motor and mesolimbic reward systems. Despite itsimportance, the distribution of the dopaminergic system has not been well studiedin the teleost brain. The African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni has becomean important model system in social neuroscience and lends itself to uncoveringhow social decisions are implemented in the brain. To understand better wheredopamine acts to regulate social behavior in this species, we have determined thedistribution of putative dopaminergic cells and fibers (by tyrosine hydroxylaseimmunohistochemistry) and dopamine receptors (by in situ hybridization for theD(1A) and D(2) dopamine receptor subtypes) throughout the forebrain and part ofthe mesencephalon of A. burtoni. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity wasevident in several regions of the fore- and midbrain, in support of putativehomologies to tetrapods. Additionally, the D(1A) and D(2) receptors wereidentified in brain regions known to modulate social behavior in othervertebrates, including the proposed teleost homologues of the mammalian amygdalarcomplex, hippocampus, striatum, preoptic area, anterior hypothalamus,ventromedial hypothalamus, and ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra parscompacta. Tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive fibers as well as D(1A) and D(2)receptor expression overlap almost completely in their distribution. Theseresults significantly extend our understanding of the distribution of thedopaminergic system in the teleost brain and suggest a conserved role of dopaminein modulating behavior across vertebrates.
 Recent work suggests the existence of a specialized neural system underlyingsocial processing that may be relatively spared with age, unlike pervasiveaging-related decline occurring in many cognitive domains. We investigated howneural mechanisms underlying social evaluation are engaged with age, and howage-related changes to socioemotional goals affect recruitment of regions within this network. In a functional MRI study, 15 young and 15 older adults formedbehavior-based impressions of individuals. They also responded to a prompt thatwas interpersonally meaningful, social but interpersonally irrelevant, ornon-social. Both age groups engaged regions implicated in mentalizing andimpression formation when making social relative to non-social evaluations,including dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortices, precuneus, andtemporoparietal junction. Older adults had increased activation over young inright temporal pole when making social relative to non-social evaluations,suggesting reliance on past experiences when evaluating others. Young adults had greater activation than old in posterior cingulate gyrus when makinginterpersonally irrelevant, compared to interpersonally meaningful, evaluations, potentially reflecting enhanced valuation of this information. The findingsdemonstrate the age-related preservation of the neural correlates underlyingsocial evaluation, and suggest that functioning in these regions might bemediated by age-related changes in socioemotional goals.
 The decision to shoot a gun engages executive control processes that can bebiased by cultural stereotypes and perceived threat. The neural locus of thedecision to shoot is likely to be found in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),where cognition and affect converge. Male military cadets at Norwich University(N=37) performed a weapon identification task in which they made rapid decisions to shoot when images of guns appeared briefly on a computer screen. Reactiontimes, error rates, and electroencephalogram (EEG) activity were recorded. Cadetsreacted more quickly and accurately when guns were primed by images ofMiddle-Eastern males wearing traditional clothing. However, cadets also made morefalse positive errors when tools were primed by these images. Error-relatednegativity (ERN) was measured for each response. Deeper ERNs were found in themedial-frontal cortex following false positive responses. Cadets who made fewererrors also produced deeper ERNs, indicating stronger executive control. Pupilsize was used to measure autonomic arousal related to perceived threat. Images ofMiddle-Eastern males in traditional clothing produced larger pupil sizes. Animage of Osama bin Laden induced the largest pupil size, as would be predictedfor the exemplar of Middle East terrorism. Cadets who showed greater increases inpupil size also made more false positive errors. Regression analyses wereperformed to evaluate predictions based on current models of perceived threat,stereotype activation, and cognitive control. Measures of pupil size (perceivedthreat) and ERN (cognitive control) explained significant proportions of thevariance in false positive errors to Middle-Eastern males in traditionalclothing, while measures of reaction time, signal detection response bias, andstimulus discriminability explained most of the remaining variance.
 Self-related processing, reflecting the evaluation of environmental signals with regard to personal relevance, is fundamental for decision-making and subsequentbehavioral responses. While self-related processing has already been investigatedin several domains, one important domain, the sexual domain, has been spared sofar. Recent imaging studies suggest that self-related processing in differentdomains involves common regions in medial orbitofrontal and prefrontal cortex,the so-called ventral cortical midline structures (CMS). However, the sameregions have also been implicated in sexual arousal, especially with regard toemotional processing in sexual arousal. Therefore it remains unclear whether thisinvolvement of ventral cortical midline regions reflects emotional processing in sexual arousal or associated self-relatedness. We here report data from aparametric event-related fMRI study that investigated the neural correlates ofself-related processing in sexual arousal, using erotic pictures from theInternational Affective Picture System. It was found that self-related activityassociated with sexual arousal showed neural activity in ventral CMS regions suchas the venteromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and the perigenual anteriorcingulate cortex (PACC), while self-related activity not associated with sexualarousal showed neural activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC). Our study indicates that self-relatedness may be considered a crucial component insexual arousal that is mediated by neural activity in ventral cortical midlinestructures.
 The field of social neuroscience has grown dramatically in recent years andcertain social responses have become amenable to mechanistic investigations.Toward that end, there has been remarkable progress in determining mechanisms fora simple sexual behavior, lordosis behavior. This work has proven that specifichormone-dependent biochemical reactions in specific parts of the mammalian brain regulate a biologically important behavior. On one hand, this sex behaviordepends on underlying mechanisms of CNS arousal. On the other hand, it serves as a prototypical social behavior. The same sex hormones and the genes that encodetheir receptors as are involved in lordosis, also affect social recognition. Herewe review evidence for a micronet of genes promoting social recognition in miceand discuss their biological roles.
 Currently, potential jurors' racial biases are measured by explicitquestioning--a poor measure because people often hide their views to adhere tosocial norms, and people have implicit views they are not consciously aware of.In this experiment, we investigated whether two alternative methods of measuring racial bias--a standard black/white, good/bad implicit association test (IAT) andneural activity, measured by fMRI, in response to seeing faces of black and whiteindividuals--could predict how much money subjects would award Black victims inhypothetical employment discrimination cases. IAT scores failed to predict howmuch money subjects awarded victims. However, in right inferior parietal lobule(BA 40) and in right superior/middle frontal gyrus (BA 9/10)--which have bothpreviously been implicated in measuring biases and implicit preferences--thedifference in neural activity between when subjects viewed black faces pairedwith neutral adjectives and when subjects viewed white faces paired with neutral adjectives was positively correlated with the amount of money the subjectsawarded victims. This suggests that brain activity measures racial bias with morepractical validity, at least in this situation and with our sample size, than acommon behavioral measure (the IAT).
 Functional neuroimaging studies have suggested the existence of 2 largelydistinct social cognition networks, one for theory of mind (taking others'cognitive perspective) and another for empathy (sharing others' affectivestates). To address whether these networks can also be dissociated at the levelof brain structure, we combined behavioral phenotyping across multiplesocio-cognitive tasks with 3-Tesla MRI cortical thickness and structuralcovariance analysis in 270 healthy adults, recruited across 2 sites. Regionalthickness mapping only provided partial support for divergent substrates,highlighting that individual differences in empathy relate to leftinsular-opercular thickness while no correlation between thickness andmentalizing scores was found. Conversely, structural covariance analysis showedclearly divergent network modulations by socio-cognitive and -affectivephenotypes. Specifically, individual differences in theory of mind related tostructural integration between temporo-parietal and dorsomedial prefrontalregions while empathy modulated the strength of dorsal anterior insula networks. Findings were robust across both recruitment sites, suggesting generalizability. At the level of structural network embedding, our study provides a doubledissociation between empathy and mentalizing. Moreover, our findings suggest thatstructural substrates of higher-order social cognition are reflected rather ininterregional networks than in the the local anatomical markup of specificregions per se.
 Verbal interaction is one of the most frequent social interactions humansencounter on a daily basis. In the current paper, we zoom in on what themulti-brain approach has contributed, and can contribute in the future, to ourunderstanding of the neural mechanisms supporting verbal interaction. Indeed,since verbal interaction can only exist between individuals, it seems intuitiveto focus analyses on inter-individual neural markers, i.e. between-brain neuralcoupling. To date, however, there is a severe lack of theoretically-driven,testable hypotheses about what between-brain neural coupling actually reflects.In this paper, we develop a testable hypothesis in which between-pair variationin between-brain neural coupling is of key importance. Based on theoreticalframeworks and empirical data, we argue that the level of between-brain neuralcoupling reflects speaker-listener alignment at different levels of linguisticand extra-linguistic representation. We discuss the possibility thatbetween-brain neural coupling could inform us about the highest level ofinter-speaker alignment: mutual understanding.
 BACKGROUND: This study investigates the modulatory effect of stimulus sequence onneural responses to novel stimuli. A group of 34 healthy volunteers underwentevent-related functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing athree-stimulus visual oddball task, involving randomly presented frequent stimuliand two types of infrequent stimuli - targets and distractors. NEW METHOD: Wedeveloped a modified categorization of rare stimuli that incorporated the type ofpreceding rare stimulus, and analyzed the event-related functional data accordingto this sequence categorization; specifically, we explored hemodynamic responsemodulation associated with increasing rare-to-rare stimulus interval. RESULTS:For two consecutive targets, a modulation of brain function was evidentthroughout posterior midline and lateral temporal cortex, while responses totargets preceded by distractors were modulated in a widely distributedfronto-parietal system. As for distractors that follow targets, brain functionwas modulated throughout a set of posterior brain structures. For two successive distractors, however, no significant modulation was observed, which is consistentwith previous studies and our primary hypothesis. COMPARISON WITH EXISTINGMETHODS: The addition of the aforementioned technique extends the possibilitiesof conventional oddball task analysis, enabling researchers to explore theeffects of the whole range of rare stimuli intervals. CONCLUSION: Thismethodology can be applied to study a wide range of associated cognitivemechanisms, such as decision making, expectancy and attention.
 In social interactions, the perception of how risky our decisions are depends on how we anticipate other people's behaviors. We used electroencephalography tostudy the neurobiology of perception of social risk, in subjects playing the roleof proposers in an iterated ultimatum game in pairs. Based on statisticalmodeling, we used the previous behaviors of both players to separate high-risk[HR] offers from low-risk [LR] offers. The HR offers present higher rejectionprobability and higher entropy (variability of possible outcome) than the LRoffers. Rejections of LR offers elicited both a stronger mediofrontal negativity and a higher prefrontal theta activity than rejections of HR offers. Moreover,prior to feedback, HR offers generated a drop in alpha activity in an extendednetwork. Interestingly, trial-by-trial variation in alpha activity in the medial prefrontal, posterior temporal, and inferior pariental cortex was specificallymodulated by risk and, together with theta activity in the prefrontal andposterior cingulate cortex, predicted the proposer's subsequent behavior. Ourresults provide evidence that alpha and theta oscillations are sensitive tosocial risk and underlie a fine-tuning regulation of social decisions.
 UNLABELLED: Altruistic behavior varies considerably across people and decisioncontexts. The relevant computational and motivational mechanisms that underlieits heterogeneity, however, are poorly understood. Using a charitable giving tasktogether with multivariate decoding techniques, we identified three distinctpsychological mechanisms underlying altruistic decision-making (empathy,perspective taking, and attentional reorienting) and linked them to dissociableneural computations. Neural responses in the anterior insula (AI) (but nottemporoparietal junction [TPJ]) encoded trial-wise empathy for beneficiaries,whereas the TPJ (but not AI) predicted the degree of perspective taking.Importantly, the relative influence of both socio-cognitive processes differedacross individuals: participants whose donation behavior was heavily influencedby affective empathy exhibited higher predictive accuracies for generosity in AI,whereas those who strongly relied on cognitive perspective taking showed improvedpredictions of generous donations in TPJ. Furthermore, subject-specificcontributions of both processes for donations were reflected in participants'empathy and perspective taking responses in a separate fMRI task (EmpaToM),suggesting that process-specific inputs into altruistic choices may reflectparticipants' general propensity to either empathize or mentalize. Finally, usingindependent attention task data, we identified shared neural codes forattentional reorienting and generous donations in the posterior superior temporalsulcus, suggesting that domain-general attention shifts also contribute togenerous behavior (but not in TPJ or AI). Overall, our findings demonstratehighly specific roles of AI for affective empathy and TPJ for cognitiveperspective taking as precursors of prosocial behavior and suggest that thesediscrete routes of social cognition differentially drive intraindividual andinterindividual differences in altruistic behavior. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Humansocieties depend on the altruistic behavior of their members, but teasing apartits underlying motivations and neural mechanisms poses a serious challenge. Usingmultivariate decoding techniques, we delineated three distinct processes foraltruistic decision-making (affective empathy, cognitive perspective taking, and domain-general attention shifts), linked them to dissociable neural computations,and identified their relative influence across individuals. Distinguishingprocess-specific computations both behaviorally and neurally is crucial fordeveloping complete theoretical and neuroscientific accounts of altruisticbehavior and more effective means of increasing it. Moreover, information on the relative influence of subprocesses across individuals and its link to people'smore general propensity to engage empathy or perspective taking can informtraining programs to increase prosociality, considering their "fit" withdifferent individuals.
 An audience effect arises when a person's behaviour changes because they believe someone else is watching them. Though these effects have been known about forover 110 years, the cognitive mechanisms of the audience effect and how it might vary across different populations and cultures remains unclear. In this review,we examine the hypothesis that the audience effect draws on implicit mentalising abilities. Behavioural and neuroimaging data from a number of tasks areconsistent with this hypothesis. We further review data suggest that how peoplerespond to audiences may vary over development, personality factors, culturalbackground and clinical diagnosis including autism and anxiety disorder. Overall,understanding and exploring the audience effect may contribute to our models ofsocial interaction, including reputation management and mentalising.
 The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complex plays important roles in virtuallyall cells of the body. The enzymatic activity of PI3K to phosphorylatephosphoinositides in the membrane is mediated by a group of catalytic andregulatory subunits. Among those, the class I catalytic subunits, p110alpha,p110beta, p110gamma, and p110delta, have recently drawn attention in theneuroscience field due to their specific dysregulation in diverse braindisorders. While in non-neuronal cells these catalytic subunits may havepartially redundant functions, there is increasing evidence that in neurons theirroles are more specialized, and confined to distinct receptor-dependent pathways.This review will summarize the emerging role of class I PI3K catalytic subunitsin neurotransmitter-regulated neuronal signaling, and their dysfunction in avariety of neurological diseases, including fragile X syndrome, schizophrenia,and epilepsy. We will discuss recent literature describing the use of PI3Ksubunit-selective inhibitors to rescue brain disease-associated phenotypes in in vitro and animal models. These studies give rise to the exciting prospect thatthese drugs, originally designed for cancer treatment, may be repurposed astherapeutic drugs for brain disorders in the future.
 It is commonly assumed that threatening expressions are perceptually prioritised,possessing the ability to automatically capture and hold attention. Recentevidence suggests that this prioritisation depends on the task relevance ofemotion in the case of attention holding and for fearful expressions. Using ahybrid attentional blink (AB) and repetition blindness (RB) paradigm weinvestigated whether task relevance also impacts on prioritisation throughattention capture and perceptual salience, and if these effects generalise toangry expressions. Participants judged either the emotion (relevant condition) orgender (irrelevant condition) of two target facial stimuli (fearful, angry orneutral) imbedded in a stream of distractors. Attention holding and capturing wasoperationalised as modulation of AB deficits by first target (T1) and secondtarget (T2) expression. Perceptual salience was operationalised as RB modulation.When emotion was task-relevant (Experiment 1; N = 29) fearful expressionscaptured and held attention, and were more perceptually salient than neutralexpressions. Angry expressions captured attention, but were less perceptuallysalient and capable of holding attention than fearful and neutral expressions.When emotion was task-irrelevant (Experiment 2; N = 30), only fearful attentioncapture and perceptual salience effects remained significant. Our findingshighlight the importance for threat-prioritisation research to heed both the typeof threat and prioritisation investigated.
 Social conflict is a predominant stressor in humans and is associated withincreased risk for developing psychological illnesses including depression andanxiety. Overwhelmingly, more women suffer from these disorders, which may be dueto increased stress sensitivity. Like humans, rodents experience a myriad ofphysiological and behavioral sequelae due to prolonged stress exposure. Although the motivation for social conflict may differ between humans and rodents, female rodents may provide an opportunity to explore the underlying mechanisms by which stress confers risk for psychopathology in women. Because most female rodents do not express spontaneous aggression, the majority of basic research examines thephysiological and behavioral outcomes of social conflict in male rodents.However, there are instances where female rodents exhibit territorial (Californiamice and Syrian hamsters) and maternal aggression (rats, mice, and hamsters)creating a venue to examine sex differences in physiology and behavior inresponse to stress. While many studies rely upon nonsocial behavioral assays(e.g., elevated plus maze, forced swim test) to assess the impact of stress onemotionality, here we primarily focus on behavioral outcomes in social-basedassays in rodents. This is critically important given that disruptions in social relationships can be a cause and consequence of neuropsychiatric diseases. Next, we briefly discuss how sex differences in the recruitment of neural circuitryand/or neurochemistry in response to stress may underlie sex differences inneuroendocrine and behavioral stress responses. Finally, the translational value of females in rodent stress models and considerations regarding behavioralinterpretations of these models are discussed. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
 In this work, the neural correlates of emotional processing in Colombianex-combatants with different empathy profiles were compared to normal controlsmatched for age, gender and educational level. Forty ex-combatants and 20 nonex-combatants were recruited for this study. Empathy levels as well as executive functions were measured. Empathy level was used to create three groups. Group 1(G1) included ex-combatants with normal empathy scores, and Group 2 includedex-combatants with low scores on at least one empathy sub-scales. In controlgroup (Ctrl), participants with no antecedents of being combatants and withnormal scores in empathy were included. Age, gender, educational and intelligencequotients level were controlled among groups. event-related potentials (ERPs)were recorded while individuals performed an affective picture processing taskthat included positive, neutral and negative emotional stimuli, which elicit anearly modulation of emotion categorization (Early Posterior Negativity (EPN)) andlate evaluative process (LPP). EPN differences were found among affectivecategories, but no group effects were observed at this component. LPP showed amain effect of category and group (higher amplitudes in ex-combatants). There wasan inverse correlation between empathy and executive functions scores and ERPs.Results are discussed according to the impact of emotional processing on empathy profile.
 The understanding of actions of tool use depends on the motor act that isperformed and on the function of the objects involved in the action. We usedevent-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the processes that derive bothkinds of information in a task in which inserting actions had to be judged. Theactions were presented as two consecutive frames, one showing aneffector/instrument and the other showing a potential target object of theaction. Two mismatches were possible. An orientation mismatch occurred when thespatial object properties were not consistent with a motor act of insertion beingperformed (i.e., different orientations of insert and slot). A functionalmismatch happened when the instrument (e.g., screwdriver) would usually not beapplied to the target object (e.g., keyhole). The order in which instrument andtarget object were presented was also varied. The two kinds of mismatch gave riseto similar but not identical negativities in the latency range of the N400followed by a positive modulation. The results indicate that the motor act andthe function of the objects are derived by two at least partially differentsubprocesses and become integrated into a common representation of the observedaction.
 Recently, there has been growing emphasis on enhancing subjective quality of life(QOL), in addition to treating symptoms or extending one's life. However, theneurobiological basis of subjective QOL is unknown. To illuminate the neuralsubstrates that inform subjective QOL, the association between prefrontalfunction and subjective QOL was explored in 72 healthy volunteers (40 women and32 men; age, 45.1 +/- 20.1 y), using 52-channel near-infrared spectroscopy(NIRS), a portable neuroimaging device that can measure brain function in aless-constrained condition. Results confirmed that subjective QOL was positively correlated with prefrontal hemodynamic response during a cognitive task and that subjective satisfaction regarding social relationships and in the physicaldomains were cardinal contributors to the association. These findings suggestthat subjective QOL has possible involvement in prefrontal function and that NIRSpotentially plays a role as a biological marker of subjective QOL.
 BACKGROUND: The management of stroke prevention among patients with atrialfibrillation (AF) has changed in the last few years. Despite the benefits of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs), decisions about the optimal agent remain achallenge. We provide a visual aid tool to guide clinicians and patients in thedecision process of selecting oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention. METHODS:We created visual plots representing benefits of warfarin versus NOACs from ameta-analysis comprising 58,541 participants. Visual plots (Cates plots) werecreated using software available at nntonline.net. The primary outcome was strokeor systemic embolism during the study period. RESULTS: In the chosenmeta-analysis, 29,312 participants received a NOAC and 29,229 participantsreceived warfarin. For every 1000 patients with AF, 38 would have a stroke orsystemic embolic event in the warfarin group compared to 31 in the NOAC group (RR.81; 95% CI .73-.91). Fifteen patients would develop an intracranial hemorrhagein the warfarin group compared to 7 in the NOAC group (RR .48; 95% CI .39-.59).Conversely, 25 patients would develop gastrointestinal bleeding in the NOAC groupcompared to 20 in the warfarin group (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.01-1.55). CONCLUSION: Forevery 1000 treated individuals with AF, NOACs would prevent stroke or systemicembolism in 7 additional patients and cerebral hemorrhage in 8 additionalpatients compared to warfarin. On the other hand, 5 more patients would developgastrointestinal bleeding with NOACs compared to warfarin. These data arevisually shown in Cates plots, facilitating conversations with patients regardinganticoagulation decisions.
 The common saying "time is money" reflects the widespread belief in many people'severyday life that time is valuable like money. Psychologically andneurophysiologically, however, these concepts seem to be quite different. Thisresearch replicates prior behavioral investigations by showing that merelymentioning "time" (compared to merely mentioning "money") leads participants toevaluate a product more positively. Beyond this finding, the present functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment provides novel insight into theneurophysiological underpinnings of this behavioral effect by showing that morepositive product evaluations in the time primes (compared to money primes) arepreceded by increased activation in the insula. Our data, therefore, support the idea of a time mindset that is different from a money mindset. Studies on thefunctional neuroanatomy of the insula have implicated this brain area in distinctbut related psychological phenomena such as urging, addiction, loss aversion, andlove. These functions imply greater personal connection between the consumer and a target subject or object and, thus, help explain why time-primed consumers rateproducts more positively.
 Social species, from Drosophila melanogaster to Homo sapiens, fare poorly whenisolated. Homo sapiens, an irrepressibly meaning-making species, are, in normalcircumstances, dramatically affected by perceived social isolation. Researchindicates that perceived social isolation (i.e. loneliness) is a risk factor for,and may contribute to, poorer overall cognitive performance, faster cognitivedecline, poorer executive functioning, increased negativity and depressivecognition, heightened sensitivity to social threats, a confirmatory bias insocial cognition that is self-protective and paradoxically self-defeating,heightened anthropomorphism and contagion that threatens social cohesion. Thesedifferences in attention and cognition impact on emotions, decisions, behaviorsand interpersonal interactions that can contribute to the association betweenloneliness and cognitive decline and between loneliness and morbidity moregenerally.
 Why do people tend to care for upholding principles of justice? This studyexamined the association between individual differences in the affective,motivational and cognitive components of empathy, sensitivity to justice, andpsychopathy in participants (N 265) who were also asked to rate thepermissibility of everyday moral situations that pit personal benefit againstmoral standards of justice. Counter to common sense, emotional empathy was notassociated with sensitivity to injustice for others. Rather, individualdifferences in cognitive empathy and empathic concern predicted sensitivity tojustice for others, as well as the endorsement of moral rules. Psychopathycoldheartedness scores were inversely associated with motivation for justice.Moreover, hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis revealed thatself-focused and other-focused orientations toward justice had opposinginfluences on the permissibility of moral judgments. High scores on psychopathywere associated with less moral condemnation of immoral behavior. Together, theseresults contribute to a better understanding of the information processingmechanisms underlying justice motivation, and may guide interventions designed tofoster justice and moral behavior. In order to promote justice motivation, it maybe more effective to encourage perspective taking and reasoning than emphasizing emotional sharing with the misfortune of others.
 Maternal presence has a potent buffering effect on infant fear and stressresponses in primates. We previously reported that maternal presence is noteffective in buffering the endocrine stress response in infant rhesus monkeysreared by maltreating mothers. We have also reported that maltreating mothersshow low maternal responsiveness and permissiveness/secure-base behavior.Although still not understood, it is possible that this maternal buffering effectis mediated, at least partially, through deactivation of amygdala responsecircuits when mothers are present. Here, we studied rhesus monkey infants thatdiffered in the quality of early maternal care to investigate how this earlyexperience modulated maternal buffering effects on behavioral responses tonovelty during the weaning period. We also examined the relationship betweenthese behavioral responses and structural connectivity in one of the underlyingregulatory neural circuits: amygdala-prefrontal pathways. Our findings suggestthat infant exploration in a novel situation is predicted by maternalresponsiveness and structural integrity of amygdala-prefrontal white matterdepending on maternal presence (positive relationships when mother is absent).These results provide evidence that maternal buffering of infant behavioralinhibition is dependent on the quality of maternal care and structuralconnectivity of neural pathways that are sensitive to early life stress.
 Our various daily activities continually require regulation of our internalstate. These regulatory processes covary with changes in High Frequency HeartRate Variability (HF-HRV), a marker of parasympathetic activity. Specifically,incidental increases in HF-HRV accompany positive social engagement behavior and prosocial action. Little is known about deliberate regulation of HF-HRV and therole of voluntary parasympathetic regulation in prosocial behavior. Here, wepresent a novel biofeedback task that measures the ability to deliberatelyincrease HF-HRV. In two large samples, we find that a) participants are able tovoluntarily upregulate HF-HRV, and b) variation in this ability predictsindividual differences in altruistic prosocial behavior, but not non-altruisticforms of prosociality, assessed through 14 different measures. Our findingssuggest that self-induction of parasympathetic states is involved in altruisticaction. The biofeedback task may provide a measure of deliberate parasympathetic regulation, with implications for the study of attention, emotion, and socialbehavior.
 Quaking (QKI), which belongs to the STAR family of KH domain-containingRNA-binding proteins, functions in pre-mRNA splicing, microRNA regulation, andformation of circular RNA. QKI plays critical roles in myelinogenesis in thecentral and peripheral nervous systems and has been implicated neuron-glia fatedecision in the brain; however, neither the expression nor function of QKI in theneural retina is known. Here we report the expression of QKI RNA-binding protein in the developing and mature mouse retina. QKI was strongly expressed by Mullerglial cells in both the developing and adult retina. Intriguingly, duringdevelopment, QKI was expressed in early differentiating neurons, such as thehorizontal and amacrine cells, and subsequently in later differentiating bipolar cells, but not in photoreceptors. Neuronal expression was uniformly weak in theadult. Among QKI isoforms (5, 6, and 7), QKI-5 was the predominantly expressedisoform in the adult retina. To study the function of QKI in the mouse retina, weexamined quakingviable(qkv) mice, which have a dysmyelination phenotype thatresults from deficiency of QKI expression and reduced numbers of matureoligodendrocytes. In homozygous qkv mutant mice (qkv/qkv), the optic nerveexpression levels of QKI-6 and 7, but not QKI-5 were reduced. In the retina ofthe mutant homozygote, QKI-5 levels were unchanged, and QKI-6 and 7 levels,already low, were also unaffected. We conclude that QKI is expressed indeveloping and adult Muller glia. QKI is additionally expressed in progenitorsand in differentiating neurons during retinal development, but expressionweakened or diminished during maturation. Among QKI isoforms, we found that QKI-5predominated in the adult mouse retina. Since Muller glial cells are thought toshare properties with retinal progenitor cells, our data suggest that QKI maycontribute to maintaining retinal progenitors prior to differentiation intoneurons. On the other hand, the expression of QKI in different retinal neuronsmay suggest a role in neuronal cell type specific fate determination andmaturation. The data raises the possibility that QKI may function in retinal cellfate determination and maturation in both glia and neurons.
 Most mental disorders involve disruptions of normal social behavior. Socialneuroscience is an interdisciplinary field devoted to understanding thebiological systems underlying social processes and behavior, and the influence ofthe social environment on biological processes, health and well-being. Researchin this field has grown dramatically in recent years. Active areas of researchinclude brain imaging studies in normal children and adults, animal models ofsocial behavior, studies of stroke patients, imaging studies of psychiatricpatients, and research on social determinants of peripheral neural,neuroendocrine and immunological processes. Although research in these areas isproceeding along largely independent trajectories, there is increasing evidencefor connections across these trajectories. We focus here on the progress andpotential of social neuroscience in psychiatry, including illustrative evidencefor a rapid growth of neuroimaging and genetic studies of mental disorders. Wealso argue that neuroimaging and genetic research focused on specific componentprocesses underlying social living is needed.
 Simonson et al. present an ambitious sketch of an integrative theory of context. Provoked by this thoughtful proposal, I discuss what is the function of theories of choice in the coming decades. Traditionally, choice models and theory haveattempted to predict choices as a function of the attributes of options. I argue that to be truly useful, they need to generate specific and quantitativepredictions of the effect of the choice environment upon choice probability. Todo this, we need to focus on rigorously modeling and measuring the underlyingprocesses causing these effects, and use the Simonson et al. proposal to provide some examples. I also present some examples from research in decision-making and decision neuroscience, and argue that models that fail, and fail spectacularlyare particularly useful. I close with a challenge: How would consumer researcher aid the design of real world choice environments such as the health exchangesunder the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act?
 Research findings show that proposers make surprisingly fair offers in theultimatum and dictator games, an observation that contradicts predictions ofclassical game theory. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)study examines brain activities of proposers that contribute to fair and unfairbehaviors. We hypothesized that egoistic and altruistic motives of proposersaffect fairness differentially in the two games. fMRI analysis revealed that the 28% of fair offers in the present ultimatum game were related to enhancedactivity in prefrontal areas, in particular, in regions involved in reward andtheory of mind. This corroborates the idea that egoistic motives are primarilyresponsible for fair offers in this game, which we denote as strategic fairness. Fair offers in the dictator game, however, were related to increased activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex. Thissupports the idea that altruistic motives primarily drive fair offers in thedictator game, denoted here as altruistic fairness.
 The current study examined blood oxygen level-dependent signal underlying racial differences in threat detection. During functional magnetic resonance imaging,participants determined whether pictures of Black or White individuals heldweapons. They were instructed to make shoot responses when the picture showedarmed individuals but don't shoot responses to unarmed individuals, with the costof not shooting armed individuals being greater than that of shooting unarmedindividuals. Participants were faster to shoot armed Blacks than Whites, butfaster in making don't shoot responses to unarmed Whites than Blacks. Brainactivity differed to armed versus unarmed targets depending on target race,suggesting different mechanisms underlying threat versus safety decisions.Anterior cingulate cortex was preferentially engaged for unarmed Whites thanBlacks. Parietal and visual cortical regions exhibited greater activity for armedBlacks than Whites. Seed-based functional connectivity of the amygdala revealedgreater coherence with parietal and visual cortices for armed Blacks than Whites.Furthermore, greater implicit Black-danger associations were associated withincreased amygdala activation to armed Blacks, compared to armed Whites. Ourresults suggest that different neural mechanisms may underlie racial differences in responses to armed versus unarmed targets.
 Cognitive and affective theory of mind (ToM) can be impaired in the course ofneurodegenerative dementias. Experimental tests based on different taskconditions and/or complexity may fail to capture disease-specific patterns ofimpairments. In this study, we assessed with a single task both the affective andthe cognitive facets of ToM ability in a sample of 47 patients (i.e., 12 AD, 20bvFTD, and 15 aMCI fulfilling IWG criteria for AD in predementia phase) and 65healthy controls. Subjects were administered the Story-based Empathy task (SET), a non-verbal task measuring the ability to infer others' intentions (IA) andemotions (EA) compared to a control condition (causal inferences, CI). Global andsingle sub-condition scores were evaluated with a vectorial method, analyzing therelationship between social abilities and basic cognitive functioning by means oftwo indices representing the basic ability to perform the task and the balancebetween basic functions and ToM skills.Dementia (AD and bvFTD) patients showedimpaired performances on all SET sub-conditions, whereas aMCI subjects'performance was not different from healthy controls. Vectorial analysis revealed a specific change in the balance between EA and CI conditions only in the bvFTDgroup, supporting a disproportionate deficit in mental states attribution basedon affective cues. The overall deficit in the task in AD appears to be moregeneral and related to the severity of dementia. This latter finding is furthersupported by the normal performance of the prodromal AD group.
 A recent meta-analysis explored the role of the cerebellum in social cognitionand documented that this part of the brain is critically implicated in socialcognition, especially in more abstract and complex forms of mentalizing. Theauthors found an overlap with clusters involved in sensorimotor (during mirrorand self-judgment tasks) as well as in executive processes (across all tasks)documented in earlier nonsocial cerebellar meta-analyses, and hence interpretedtheir results in terms of a domain-general function of the cerebellum. However,these meta-analytic results might be interpreted in a different, complementaryway. Indeed, the results reveal a striking overlap with the parcellation ofcerebellar topography offered by a recent functional connectivity analysis. Inparticular, the majority of social cognitive activity in the cerebellum can also be explained as located within the boundaries of a default/mentalizing network ofthe cerebellum, with the exception of the involvement of primary and integrative somatomotor networks for self-related and mirror tasks, respectively. Given thesubstantial overlap, a novel interpretation of the meta-analytic findings is put forward suggesting that cerebellar activity during social judgments might reflecta more domain-specific mentalizing functionality in some areas of the cerebellum than assumed before.
 Mothers need to make caregiving decisions to meet the needs of children, whichmay or may not result in positive child feedback. Variations in caregivers'emotional reactivity to unpleasant child-feedback may be partially explained bytheir dispositional empathy levels. Furthermore, empathic response to the child'sunpleasant feedback likely helps mothers to regulate their own stress. Weinvestigated the relationship between maternal dispositional empathy, stressreactivity, and neural correlates of child feedback to caregiving decisions. InPart 1 of the study, 33 female participants were recruited to undergo a lab-basedmild stressor, the Social Evaluation Test (SET), and then in Part 2 of the study,a subset of the participants, 14 mothers, performed a Parenting Decision MakingTask (PDMT) in an fMRI setting. Four dimensions of dispositional empathy based onthe Interpersonal Reactivity Index were measured in all participants-PersonalDistress, Empathic Concern, Perspective Taking, and Fantasy. Overall, we foundthat the Personal Distress and Perspective Taking were associated with greaterand lesser cortisol reactivity, respectively. The four types of empathy weredistinctly associated with the negative (vs. positive) child feedback activation in the brain. Personal Distress was associated with amygdala and hypothalamusactivation, Empathic Concern with the left ventral striatum, ventrolateralprefrontal cortex (VLPFC), and supplemental motor area (SMA) activation, andFantasy with the septal area, right SMA and VLPFC activation. Interestingly,hypothalamus-septal coupling during the negative feedback condition wasassociated with less PDMT-related cortisol reactivity. The roles of distinctforms of dispositional empathy in neural and stress responses are discussed.
 In spite of the remarkable progress made in the burgeoning field of socialneuroscience, the neural mechanisms that underlie social encounters are onlybeginning to be studied and could - paradoxically - be seen as representing the"dark matter" of social neuroscience. Recent conceptual and empiricaldevelopments consistently indicate the need for investigations that allow thestudy of real-time social encounters in a truly interactive manner. Thissuggestion is based on the premise that social cognition is fundamentallydifferent when we are in interaction with others rather than merely observingthem. In this article, we outline the theoretical conception of a second-personapproach to other minds and review evidence from neuroimaging,psychophysiological studies, and related fields to argue for the development of asecond-person neuroscience, which will help neuroscience to really "go social";this may also be relevant for our understanding of psychiatric disordersconstrued as disorders of social cognition.
 Parental reflective functioning refers to the capacity for a parent to understandtheir own and their infant's mental states, and how these mental states relate tobehavior. Higher levels of parental reflective functioning may be associated withgreater sensitivity to infant emotional signals in fostering adaptive andresponsive caregiving. We investigated this hypothesis by examining associations between parental reflective functioning and neural correlates of infant face and cry perception using event-related potentials (ERPs) in a sample of recentmothers. We found both early and late ERPs were associated with differentcomponents of reflective functioning. These findings suggest that parentalreflective functioning may be associated with the neural correlates of infant cueperception and further support the value of enhancing reflective functioning as amechanism in parenting intervention programs.
 The physiology of the oxytocin receptor has increasingly become a focus ofscientific investigation due to its connection with social behavior andpsychiatric disorders with impairments in social funciton. Experimentalutilization of small molecule and peptide antagonists for the oxytocin receptorhas played a role in deciphering these biological and social behavior connectionsin rodents. Described herein is the evaluation of a potent and selective oxytocinreceptor antagonist, ALS-I-41, and details to consider for its use in nonhumanprimate behavioral pharmacology experiments utilizing intranasal or intramuscularadministration. The central nervous system penetration and rate of metabolism of ALS-I-41 was investigated via mass spectroscopy analysis of cerebrospinal fluidand plasma in the rhesus macaque after intranasal and intramuscularadministration. Positron emission tomography was also utilized with [18F]ALS-I-41 in a macaque to verify observed central nervous system (CNS) penetrationand to further evaluate the effects of administration rate on CNS penetration of Sprague-Dawley rats in comparison to previous studies.
 A large body of evidence links altered opioid signaling with changes in socialbehavior in animals. However, few studies have attempted to determine whethersimilar links exist in humans. Here we investigate whether a common polymorphism (A118G) in the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) is associated with alterations in personality traits linked to affiliative behavior and attachment. In a mixedsample (N = 214) of adult healthy volunteers and psychiatric patients, weanalyzed the association between the A118G polymorphism of the OPRM1 and twodifferent psychological constructs reflecting individual differences in thecapacity to experience social reward. Compared to individuals expressing only themajor allele (A) of the A118G polymorphism, subjects expressing the minor allele (G) had an increased tendency to become engaged in affectionate relationships, asindicated by lower scores on a self-report measure of avoidant attachment, andexperienced more pleasure in social situations, as indicated by lower scores on aself-report measure of social anhedonia. The OPRM1 variation accounted for about 3.5% of the variance in the two measures. The significant association between theA118G polymorphism and social hedonic capacity was independent of theparticipants' mental health status. The results reported here are in agreementwith the brain opioid hypothesis of social attachment and the established role ofopioid transmission in mediating affiliative behavior.
 Although histone acetylation is one of the most widely studied epigeneticmodifications, there is still a lack of information regarding how the acetylomeis regulated during brain development and pathophysiological processes. Wedemonstrate that the embryonic brain (E15) is characterized by an increase inH3K9 acetylation as well as decreases in the levels of HDAC1 and HDAC3. Moreover,experimental induction of H3K9 hyperacetylation led to the overexpression of NCAMin the embryonic cortex and depletion of Sox2 in the subventricular ependyma,which mimicked the differentiation processes. Inducing differentiation inHDAC1-deficient mouse ESCs resulted in early H3K9 deacetylation, Sox2downregulation and enhanced astrogliogenesis, whereas neuro-differentiation wasalmost suppressed. Neuro-differentiation of (wt) ESCs was characterized by H3K9hyperacetylation that was associated with HDAC1 and HDAC3 depletion. Conversely, the hippocampi of schizophrenia-like animals showed H3K9 deacetylation that wasregulated by an increase in both HDAC1 and HDAC3. The hippocampi ofschizophrenia-like brains that were treated with the cannabinoid receptor-1inverse antagonist AM251 expressed H3K9ac at the level observed in normal brains.Together, the results indicate that co-regulation of H3K9ac by HDAC1 and HDAC3 isimportant to both embryonic brain development and neuro-differentiation as wellas the pathophysiology of a schizophrenia-like phenotype.

 Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2 (SCA2) is a rare genetic disorder producingcerebellar degeneration and affecting motor abilities. Neuroimaging studies also show neurodegeneration in subcortical and cortical regions related to emotionaland social processes. From social neuroscience, it is suggested that motor andsocial abilities can be influenced by particular cultural dynamics so, culture isfundamental to understand the effect of brain-related alterations. Here, wepresent the first analysis about the cultural elements related to the SCA2disorder in 15 patients previously evaluated with neuroimaging and psychometricinstruments, and their nuclear relationships distributed in six geographical and cultural regions in Mexico. Ethnographic records and photographic and videoarchives about the quotidian participant's routine were obtained from thepatients, their relatives and their caregivers. The information was categorizedand interpreted taking into consideration cultural issues and patients' medicalfiles. Our analyses suggest that most of the participants do not understand thenature of the disease and this misunderstanding favors magic and non-medicalexplanations. Patients' testimonies suggest a decrease in pain perception as wellas motor alterations that may be related to interoceptive dysfunctions.Relatives' testimonies indicate patients' lack of social and emotional interests that may be related to frontal, temporal, and cerebellar degeneration. Ingeneral, participants use their religious beliefs to deal with the disease andonly a few of them trust the health system. Patients and their families areeither openly rejected and ignored, tolerated or even helped by their communityaccordingly to different regional traits. We propose that ethnography can providesocial representations to understand the patients' alterations, to formulateneurobiological hypotheses, to develop neurocognitive interventions, and toimprove the medical approach to the disease.
 CONTEXT: Empathy and compassion are important catalysts for the healing process, but some research suggests their decline during training and practice. Compassioninvolves recognition, understanding, emotional resonance and empathic concern foranother's concerns, distress, pain and suffering, coupled with theiracknowledgement, and motivation and relational action to ameliorate theseconditions. COMPASSION, ALTRUISM AND REWARD: Neuroscientists have identifiedneural networks that generate shared representations of directly experienced and observed feelings, sensations and actions. When shared representations evokeempathic concern or compassion for another's painful situation, humans experiencealtruistic motivation to help. The resulting behaviours are associated withactivation of areas in the brain associated with affiliation and reward.COMPASSION MODULATORS: Activation of these neural networks is sensitive tomultiple inter- and intrapersonal influences. These include the ability to focus one's attention, the ability to receive and accurately interpret input aboutdistress, the perspective one adopts in order to understand another's experience,self-other boundary awareness, the degree to which one values another's welfare, the ability to recognise and regulate one's own emotions, the ability to attendto one's own wellbeing through self-care and self-compassion, effectivecommunication skills, reflection and meta-cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Currentresearch suggests that compassion can be modulated through education and trainingand is associated with positive emotions, a sense of affiliation, reward andprosocial behaviours. A compassion process model and framework with examples ofeducational goals, interventions and resources for curriculum development aredescribed. However, education must be aligned with changes in clinical practiceto sustain compassionate care.
 The aim of the present study was to test whether the eyes of an intact faceproduced a specific brain response compared to the mouth, nose, or hair andwhether their specificity was also maintained in a scrambled face. Fifteensubjects were asked to focus visual attention on global and single elements inintact faces and in their scrambled image. EEG data were recorded from256-Hydrocel Geodesic Sensor-Net200. Event-related potentials (ERPs) analysesshowed a difference between the intact face and the scrambled face from N170component until 600 ms on the occipito-temporal montage and at 400-600 ms on the frontal montage. Only the eyes showed a difference between conditions(intact/scrambled face) at 500 ms. The most activated source detected by sLORETA was the right middle temporal gyrus (BA21) for both conditions and for allelements. Left BA21 resulted in significantly more activation in response to eyesin the intact face compared to the eyes in the scrambled face at 500 ms. The leftBA21 has a central role in high-level visual processing and in understandingothers' intentions. These findings suggest a specificity of the eyes and indicatethat the eyes play the social and communicative role of comprehending thenonverbal intentions of others only when inserted in an intact face.
 The term sociotype has been introduced to describe the dynamic relationship of anindividual with his/her social environment throughout life. The sociotype is aconceptual framework to highlight, in addition to bio-medical pathways, thepsycho-social and environmental factors necessary to understand responses to lifestresses and patient self-management for chronic illness. The sociotype interactswith genotype expression through mate selection and metabolic programming, andwith the phenotype to determine adaptation throughout life from birth to old age.Following on the work of Antonovsky, Engel, and McEwen, and others in the lifeand social sciences, the sociotype details and expands the many factors generallyincluded in the environmental influences on a person's life identified here asthe domains of health, relationships, and environment. Physiological mediatorsfor sociotypic influences include: adrenal steroids and the sympathetic nervoussystem (allostatic load), and oxytocin (social neuroscience). The biologicalpathways are multiple through nutrition (essential dietary-derived amino- andfatty acids for neurotransmitter synthesis, caloric restriction, and diet-geneinteractions), epigenesis, and metabolic programming. Nutrition influences growthand development, fertility and longevity, and also determines susceptibility tonon-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, andparticularly diabetes and obesity, through in-utero effects, the development ofintestinal flora (microbiome), and chronic stress. Thus the sociotype andnutrition are reciprocally related in both health and disease.
 Although research in moral psychology in the last decade has relied heavily onhypothetical moral dilemmas and has been effective in understanding moraljudgment, how these judgments translate into behaviors remains a largelyunexplored issue due to the harmful nature of the acts involved. To study thislink, we follow a new approach based on a desktop virtual reality environment. Inour within-subjects experiment, participants exhibited an order-dependentjudgment-behavior discrepancy across temporally separated sessions, with many of them behaving in utilitarian manner in virtual reality dilemmas despite theirnonutilitarian judgments for the same dilemmas in textual descriptions. Thischange in decisions reflected in the autonomic arousal of participants, withdilemmas in virtual reality being perceived more emotionally arousing than theones in text, after controlling for general differences between the twopresentation modalities (virtual reality vs. text). This suggests that moraldecision-making in hypothetical moral dilemmas is susceptible to contextualsaliency of the presentation of these dilemmas.
 A second-person neuroscience, as an emerging area of neuroscience and thebehavioral sciences, cannot afford to avoid a bottom-up, subcortical, andconative-affective perspective. An example with canid social play and a modernmotivational behavioral neursocience will illustrate our point.
 OBJECTIVE: The quality of our daily social interactions-including perceptions of support, feelings of loneliness, and distress stemming from negative socialexchanges-influence physical health and well-being. Despite the importance ofsocial relationships, brief yet precise unidimensional scales that assess keyaspects of social relationship quality are lacking. As part of the NationalInstitute of Health (NIH) Toolbox for the Assessment of Neurological andBehavioral Function, we developed brief self-report scales designed to assessaspects of social support, companionship, and social distress across age cohorts.This article details the development and psychometric testing of the adult NIHToolbox Social Relationship scales. METHODS: Social relationship concepts wereselected, and item sets were developed and revised based on expert feedback andliterature review. Items were then tested across a community-dwelling U.S.Internet panel sample of adults aged 18 and above (N = 692) using traditional(classic) psychometric methods and item response theory approaches to identifyitems for inclusion in 5-8 item unidimensional scales. Finally, concurrentvalidity of the newly developed scales was evaluated with respect to theirinterrelationships with classic social relationship validation instruments.RESULTS: Results provide support for the internal reliability and concurrentvalidity of resulting self-report scales assessing Emotional Support,Instrumental Support, Friendship, Loneliness, Perceived Rejection, and Perceived Hostility. CONCLUSION: These brief social relationship scales provide thepragmatic utility and enhanced precision needed to promote future epidemiologicaland social neuroscience research on the impact of social relationships onphysical and emotional health outcomes.
 There is broad evidence that contextual factors influence the processing ofemotional facial expressions. Yet temporal-dynamic aspects, inter alia how faceprocessing is influenced by the specific order of neutral and emotional facialexpressions, have been largely neglected. To shed light on this topic, werecorded electroencephalogram from 168 healthy participants while they performed a gender-discrimination task with angry and neutral faces. Our event-relatedpotential (ERP) analyses revealed a strong emotional modulation of the N170component, indicating that the basic visual encoding and emotional analysis of a facial stimulus happen, at least partially, in parallel. While the N170 and thelate positive potential (LPP; 400-600 ms) were only modestly affected by thesequence of preceding faces, we observed a strong influence of face sequences on the early posterior negativity (EPN; 200-300 ms). Finally, the differing responsepatterns of the EPN and LPP indicate that these two ERPs represent distinctprocesses during face analysis: while the former seems to represent theintegration of contextual information in the perception of a current face, thelatter appears to represent the net emotional interpretation of a current face.
 Emotion regulation research has primarily focused on techniques that attenuate ormodulate the impact of emotional stimuli. Recent evidence suggests that this moderegulation can be problematic in the context of regulation of emotion elicited bythe suffering of others, resulting in reduced emotional connectedness. Here, weinvestigated the effects of an alternative emotion regulation technique based on the up-regulation of positive affect via Compassion-meditation on experientialand neural affective responses to depictions of individuals in distress, andcompared these with the established emotion regulation strategy of Reappraisal.Using fMRI, we scanned 15 expert practitioners of Compassion-meditation eitherpassively viewing, or using Compassion-meditation or Reappraisal to modulatetheir emotional reactions to film clips depicting people in distress. Bothstrategies effectively, but differentially regulated experienced affect, withCompassion primarily increasing positive and Reappraisal primarily decreasingnegative affect. Imaging results showed that Compassion, relative to bothpassive-viewing and Reappraisal increased activation in regions involved inaffiliation, positive affect and reward processing including ventral striatum andmedial orbitfrontal cortex. This network was shown to be active prior to stimuluspresentation, suggesting that the regulatory mechanism of Compassion is thestimulus-independent endogenous generation of positive affect.
 Aim of the present study was to investigate the time course of brain processesinvolved in the visual perception of different gaze interactions in woman-childdyads and the association between attachment dimensions and brain activationduring the presentation of gaze interactions. The hypothesis was that the womanavoidance will produce a greater activation of primary somatosensory and limbicareas. The attachment styles dimensions avoidant-related will be associated with fronto-limbic brain intensity during the convergence of gaze.Electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded using a 256-channel HydroCelGeodesic Sensor Net in 44 female subjects (age: 24 +/- 2 years). Event-relatedpotential (ERP) components and standardized low-resolution electromagnetictomography (sLORETA) were analyzed. Participants were administered the attachmentstyle questionnaire before EEG task. A lower P350 latency was found in thefronto-central montage in response to woman avoidance. sLORETA analysis showed a greater intensity of limbic and primary somatosensory areas in response to woman avoidance compared to the others gaze interactions. In response to convergencegaze, the confidence attachment dimension was negatively correlated with theintensities of the right temporal and limbic areas, and the relationships assecondary attachment dimension were positively correlated with the intensities ofthe bilateral frontal areas and of the left parietal area.
 The inhibition of a prepotent response is an essential executive function whichenables us to suppress inappropriate actions in a given context. Individuals withfencing expertise exhibit behavioral advantages on tasks with high demands onresponse inhibition. This study examines the electrophysiological basis for thesuperior response inhibition in experienced fencers. In the Go/Nogo task wherefrequent stimuli required a motor response while reaction had to be withheld torare stimuli, the fencers, compared with the non-fencers, exhibited behavioral aswell as electrophysiological advantages when suppressing prepotent responses. Thesuperior response inhibition in the fencers was characterized by enhanced Nogo-N2and reduced Nogo-P3. Single-trial analysis revealed that the amplitude differenceof the Nogo-N2 between two groups was caused by lower single-trial latencyvariability in the fencers (may be due to low attentional fluctuation and/orstable neural processing speed) while the amplitude difference of the Nogo-P3resulted from truly weaker neural activity in the fencers (may be because fewcognitive sources are needed and few control efforts are made). The twoinhibition-related components are distinct neurophysiological indexes that, onthe one hand, provide effective guidance to titrate the level of executivefunction in fencers, and on the other hand, facilitate to monitor fencers'improvement in the training process.
 Pediatric brain tumor (BT) survivors are at risk for psychosocial late effectsacross many domains of functioning, including neurocognitive and social. Theliterature on the social competence of pediatric BT survivors is still developingand future research is needed that integrates developmental and cognitiveneuroscience research methodologies to identify predictors of survivor socialadjustment and interventions to ameliorate problems. This review discusses thecurrent literature on survivor social functioning through a model of socialcompetence in childhood brain disorder and suggests future directions based onthis model. Interventions pursuing change in survivor social adjustment shouldconsider targeting social ecological factors.
 Individuals who engage in corrupt and immoral behavior are in some ways similarto individuals with psychopathy. Normal people refrain from engaging in suchbehaviors because they tie together the moral value of society and the risk ofpunishment when they violate social rules. What is it, then, that allows theseimmoral individuals to behave in this manner, and in some situations even toprosper? When there is a dysfunction of somatic markers, specific disadvantageousimpairments in decision-making arise, as in moral judgment, but, paradoxically,under some circumstances, the damage can cause the patient to make optimalfinancial investment decisions. Interestingly, individuals with psychopathy, apersonality disorder, share many of the same behavioral characteristics seen inVMPFC and amygdala lesion patients, suggesting that defective somatic markers mayserve as a neural framework for explaining immoral and corrupt behaviors. Whilethese sociopathic behaviors of sometimes famous and powerful individuals havelong been discussed, primarily within the realm of social science and psychology,here we offer a neurocognitive perspective on the possible neural roots ofimmoral and corrupt behaviors.
 The ability to flexibly modulate our behaviors in social contexts and tosuccessfully interact with other persons is a fundamental, but pivotal,requirement for human survival. Although previous social neuroscience researchwith single individuals has contributed greatly to our understanding of the basicmechanisms underlying social perception and social emotions, much of the dynamic nature of interactions between persons remains beyond the reach of single-brainstudies. This has led to a growing argument for a shift to the simultaneousmeasurement of the brain activity of two or more individuals in realistic social interactions-an approach termed "hyperscanning." Although this approach offersimportant promise in unlocking the brain's role in truly social situations, thereare multiple procedural and theoretical questions that require review andanalysis. In this paper we discuss this research trend from four aspects:hyperscanning apparatus, experimental task, quantification method, andtheoretical interpretation. We also give four suggestions for future research:(a) electroencephalography and near-infrared spectroscopy are useful tools bywhich to explore the interactive brain in more ecological settings; (b) games arean appropriate method to simulate daily life interactions; (c) transfer entropymay be an important method by which to quantify directed exchange of information between brains; and (d) more explanation is needed of the results of interbrainsynchronization itself.
 The effects of group membership on brain responses to social exclusion have been investigated in adults, revealing greater anterior cingulate responses toexclusion by members of one's in-group (e.g., same-gender). However, socialexclusion is a critical aspect of peer relations in youth and reaches heightened salience during adolescence, a time when social anxiety disorders are alsoemergent. While the behavioral and neural correlates of social exclusion inadolescence have been extensively explored, the effects of group membership onpeer rejection are less clear. The current study used functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the differential neural correlates ofbeing excluded by peers of one's same- versus opposite-gender during an onlineball-toss game. Participants were a group of typically developing children andadolescents (7-17 years). As predicted, anterior cingulate cortex showed a maineffect of social exclusion versus fair play. However, unlike a previous adultstudy, this region did not show increased activation to same-gender exclusion.Instead, several regions differentiating same- versus opposite-gender exclusionwere exclusively more sensitive to exclusion by one's opposite gender. Theseresults are discussed in the context of adolescent socio-emotional development.
 The lifetime prevalence of substance use disorders among schizophrenia patientsis close to 50%. The negative consequences of substance abuse in schizophreniaare well documented, but the aetiology of this comorbid condition remainsunknown. Mounting evidence suggests that dual-diagnosis patients have fewernegative symptoms and better social skills, compared to non-abusing patients. We hypothesized that schizophrenia patients with substance use disorder (SCZ-SUD)would display increased cerebral activations in response to socioemotionalstimuli, relative to patients with no SUD (SCZ). Schizophrenia patients (DSM-IVcriteria) were divided into two groups: patients with (n=12) and without (n=11)substance use (alcohol and/or cannabis). Using functional magnetic resonanceimaging (fMRI), patients were scanned during passive viewing of an emotional filmexcerpt with social content. Loci of activation were identified in the right mPFC(BA 10) and the right supramarginal gyrus (BA 40) in SCZ-SUD patients, and in theleft pons in SCZ patients. Relative to SCZ patients, increased loci of activationwere found in the right superior parietal cortex (BA 7) and the left medialprefrontal cortex (BA 10) in SCZ-SUD patients, who reported higher subjectiveemotional experience on a self-report scale. To our knowledge, this is the first fMRI study to assess social emotions in dual-diagnosis schizophrenia. Our resultssuggest that socioemotional processing may be less impaired in dual diagnosis,which recruited brain regions seemingly involved in "social cognition." Furtherstudies on the topic are warranted.
 Sensitivity to injustice inflicted on others is a strong motivator of humansocial behavior. There are, however, enormous individual differences in vicariousinjustice sensitivity. Some people are strongly affected when witnessinginjustice, while others barely notice it, but the factors behind thisheterogeneity are poorly understood. Here we examine the neuroanatomical basis ofthese differences using voxel-based morphometry and Freesurfer image analysissuite. Whole brain corrected analyses show that a person's propensity to bevicariously affected by injustice to others is reflected by the gray mattervolume and thickness of the bilateral mid insular cortex. The larger a person'sgray matter volume and thickness of the mid insula, the higher that person'ssensitivity to injustice experienced by others. These findings show that theindividual neuroanatomy of the mid insular cortex captures a person'spredisposition to be vicariously affected by injustice, and thus adds a novelaspect to previous functional work that has linked this region to the processing of transient vicarious states.
 Despite significant evidence that opioids are involved in attachment by mediatingsocial reward and motivation, the role of opioids in the formation of adultsocial attachments has not been explored. We used the socially monogamous prairievole (Microtus ochrogaster) to explore the role of endogenous opioids in socialbonding by examining partner preference formation in female prairie voles. Wehypothesized that mu-opioid receptors (MORs) in the striatum have a critical rolein partner preference formation. We therefore predicted that peripheraladministration of an opioid receptor antagonist would inhibit partner preference formation, and more specifically, that mu-opioid selective receptor blockadewithin the striatum would inhibit partner preference formation. To test ourhypotheses, we first administered the non-selective opioid antagonist naltrexone peripherally to females during an 18-h cohabitation with a male and later tested the female with a partner preference test (PPT). Females showed a doseschedule-dependent decrease in partner preference in the PPT, with females in thecontinuous dose group displaying stranger preferences. Next, we administeredmicroinjections of the MOR selective antagonistD-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2 (CTAP) into either the nucleus accumbens shell (NAS) or the caudate-putamen (CP) immediately before a 24-h cohabitationwith a male, and later tested the female with a PPT. Females receiving CTAP into the CP, but not the NAS, showed no preference in the PPT, indicating aninhibition of partner preference formation. We show here for the first time that MORs modulate partner preference formation in female prairie voles by acting inthe CP.
 Williams syndrome (WS) offers an exciting model for social neuroscience becauseits genetic basis is well-defined, and the unique phenotype reflects dimensionsof prosocial behaviors. WS is associated with a strong drive to approachstrangers, a gregarious personality, heightened social engagement yet difficultpeer interactions, high nonsocial anxiety, unusual bias toward positive affect,and diminished sensitivity to fear. New neurobiological evidence points towardalterations in structure, function, and connectivity of the social brain(amygdala, fusiform face area, orbital-frontal regions). Recent genetic studiesimplicate gene networks in the WS region with the dysregulation of prosocialneuropeptides. The study of WS has implications for understanding human socialdevelopment, and may provide insight for translating genetic and neuroendocrineevidence into treatments for disorders of social behavior.
 Despite significant advances in the field of social neuroscience, much remains tobe understood regarding the development and maintenance of social skills acrossthe life span. Few comprehensive models exist that integrate multidisciplinaryperspectives and explain the multitude of factors that influence the emergenceand expression of social skills. Here, a developmental biopsychosocial model(SOCIAL) is offered that incorporates the biological underpinnings andsocio-cognitive skills that underlie social function (attention/executivefunction, communication, socio-emotional skills), as well as the internal andexternal (environmental) factors that mediate these skills. The components of themodel are discussed in the context of the social brain network and are supported by evidence from 3 conditions known to affect social functioning (autism spectrumdisorders, schizophrenia, and traumatic brain injury). This integrative model is intended to provide a theoretical structure for understanding the origins ofsocial dysfunction and the factors that influence the emergence of social skills through childhood and adolescence in both healthy and clinical populations.
 There is an extensive literature on the negativity bias, including itsconceptualization, measurement, temporal stability (individual differences), and neural and genetic associations. Hibbing et al. posit that the difference across individuals in the negativity bias is a key factor in determining politicalpredisposition. The measures and paradigms developed in this literature provide ameans of testing this hypothesis.
 OBJECTIVE: To assess the prospective association between daily feelings ofloneliness and subsequent feelings of daytime dysfunction indicative of poorsleep quality. DESIGN: Three consecutive end-of-day diaries were completed by apopulation-based sample of 215 adults (mean age = 57.5 years, SD = 4.4). Diaryquestions probed sleep duration, daytime dysfunction (i.e., fatigue, low energy, sleepiness), loneliness, physical symptoms, and depressed affect experienced thatday. Chronic health condition data and body mass index were also obtained.Autoregressive cross-lagged panel models were used to examine the magnitude ofreciprocal prospective associations between loneliness and daytime dysfunction.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Unstandardized path coefficients adjusted forrace/ethnicity, sleep duration, marital status, household income, chronic health conditions, and health symptom severity. RESULTS: Daily variations in loneliness predicted subsequent feelings of daytime dysfunction (B = 0.16, p < .05), anddaytime dysfunction predicted subsequent loneliness (B = 0.07, p < .05), adjustedfor covariates. Loneliness continued to predict subsequent daytime dysfunctionwhen depressed affect was held constant. CONCLUSION: The effect of loneliness on daytime dysfunction was independent of sleep duration, suggesting that the sameamount of sleep is less salubrious when individuals feel more socially isolated.
 The present study investigates the temporal dynamics of the brain activitypredicting the sensory outcomes of observed hand-object interactions of others.Participants are presented with pictures of a hand grasping or withdrawing fromnoxious and neutral objects. They are then asked to judge whether thishand-object interaction causes painful consequences. In the early stages ofstimulus processing, the effect of action was observed in the event-relatedpotential components N1 and N2. Significant interactions of action x object were observed in the later components P3 and late positive potential (LPP): only when the object was noxious, the action "grasp" elicited a significantly largeramplitude than the action "withdrawal". These results suggest that: on the onehand, when observing the hand-object interaction from the third-personperspective, the action type of others can be processed in an automatic style. Onthe other hand, integrating the information of action and object to predict thesensory consequence of this interaction is a top-down, cognitive controlledprocessing. The current findings are different from previous studies usingfirst-person perspective visual stimuli which support that the processing ofhand-object interaction is rapid and automatic.
 The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) plays a critical role in modulating socialbehavior across a wide range of vertebrate species. In humans, intranasaloxytocin (INOT) has been shown to modulate various aspects of social behavior,such as empathy, trust, in-group preference, and memory of socially relevantcues. Most INOT studies employ cross-sectional designs despite the enhancedstatistical power and reduction in error variance associated with individualdifferences characteristic of within-subject designs. Using the Prisoner Dilemma task, which models a real-life dyadic social interaction, our group hassystematically explored the effect of INOT on social cooperation andnon-cooperation using a cross-sectional design. In the current study, weinvestigated if the main findings from our cross-sectional study could bereplicated in a within-subject design using the same paradigm and whether newfindings would emerge. We found OT to attenuate the ventral tegmental arearesponse to reciprocated cooperation in women, an effect that is also present in our cross-sectional sample. However, other cross-sectional findings, especiallythose found in men, were not observed in this within-subject study. Wehypothesize that the discrepancy can be explained by differing OT effects basedon the degree of stimulus novelty/familiarity. Our within-subject study alsorevealed new effects not found previously in our cross-sectional study. Mostimportantly, OT treatment on scan 2 blocked amygdala habituation tounreciprocated cooperation found in a group that received placebo on both scansamong men. Our results suggest that exogenous OT reduces the salience of positivesocial interactions among women and prevents habituation to negative socialinteractions among men. These findings may have implications for the potentialclinical utility of OT as a treatment for psychiatric disorders.
 Domestic violence (DV) is a national public health crisis. The leading treatment model, the Duluth Model, has failed to reduce or prevent DV. New models oftreatment for DV are needed. In this paper, an emphasis is placed on anintegrated multimodal approach to treating DV, integrating the currentpsychological science on the neurobiology and brain science of human violencewith recent findings in the neurobiology of group relationships to present atreatment program for DV employing a group therapy model. This group therapytreatment approach moves away from the treatment of symptoms to the treatment of the root causes of violence. The two-tier Duluth model (a community teachingmodel of psychoeducation and court-mandated behavioral therapies for maleperpetrators) is expanded to include a third tier. This is a psychologicalscience-driven model that identifies and treats the root causes of DV using agroup process and group systems-oriented approach.
 American healthcare has been shrouded in a cloak of negativity for too long. Manydoctors are more pessimistic about the state of healthcare than they were even a few decades ago. In spite of extraordinary advances in the clinical aspects ofhealthcare, the business side of medicine has created a downward spiral inphysician spirit, resulting in unnecessary stress, zapped energy, a rise ininterpersonal conflict and, ultimately and as a byproduct of this negativity,reduced patient satisfaction. This downward spiral needs to be--and canbe--stemmed. This article discuss how insights from the field of positivepsychology and social neuroscience can help healthcare providers and theirorganizations flourish, in both their professional practices and personal lives.
 Genetic approaches have improved our understanding of the neurobiological basisof social behavior and cognition. For instance, common polymorphisms of genesinvolved in oxytocin signaling have been associated with sociobehavioralphenotypes in healthy samples as well as in subjects with mental disorders. More recently, attention has been drawn to epigenetic mechanisms, which regulategenetic function and expression without changes to the underlying DNA sequence.We provide an overview of the functional importance of oxytocin receptor gene(OXTR) promoter methylation and summarize studies that have investigated the roleof OXTR methylation in behavioral phenotypes. There is first evidence that OXTRmethylation is associated with autism, high callous-unemotional traits, anddifferential activation of brain regions involved in social perception.Furthermore, psychosocial stress exposure might dynamically regulate OXTR. Given evidence that epigenetic states of genes can be modified by experiences,especially those occurring in sensitive periods early in development, we concludewith a discussion on the effects of traumatic experience on the developingoxytocin system. Epigenetic modification of genes involved in oxytocin signaling might be involved in the mechanisms mediating the long-term influence of earlyadverse experiences on socio-behavioral outcomes.
 Social neuroscience is an emerging interdisciplinary field that combines toolsfrom cognitive, cellular, and molecular neuroscience to understand the neuralmechanisms underlying human interactions, emphasizing the complementary nature ofdifferent organization levels in the social and biological domains. Previousstudies focused on the molecular/neuronal substrates of a variety of complexbehaviors, such as parental behavior and pair bonding. Less is known about thevarious factors influencing interindividual differences in reward processing and decision making in social contexts, both relying upon the dopaminergic system.This review concerns (1) basic electrophysiological findings and recentneuroimaging findings showing that reward processing and social interactionprocesses share common neural substrates and (2) genetic and hormonal influences on these processes. Recent research combining molecular genetics, endocrinology, and neuroimaging demonstrated that variations in dopamine-related genes and inhormone levels affect the physiological properties of the dopaminergic system in nonhuman primates and modulate the processing of reward and social information inhumans. These findings are important because they indicate the neural influenceof genes conferring vulnerability to develop neuropathologies such as drugaddiction and pathological gambling. Taken together, the reviewed data start tounveil the relationships between genes, hormones, and the functioning of thereward system, as well as decision making in social contexts, and provide a link between molecular, cellular, and social cognitive levels in humans.
 The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is a popular behavioral measure that assessesthe associative strength between outgroup members and stereotypical andcounterstereotypical traits. Less is known, however, about the degree to whichthe IAT reflects automatic processing. Two studies examined automatic processing contributions to a gender-IAT using a data driven, social neuroscience approach. Performance on congruent (e.g., categorizing male names with synonyms ofstrength) and incongruent (e.g., categorizing female names with synonyms ofstrength) IAT blocks were separately analyzed using EEG (event-relatedpotentials, or ERPs, and coherence; Study 1) and lesion (Study 2) methodologies. Compared to incongruent blocks, performance on congruent IAT blocks wasassociated with more positive ERPs that manifested in frontal and occipitalregions at automatic processing speeds, occipital regions at more controlledprocessing speeds and was compromised by volume loss in the anterior temporallobe (ATL), insula and medial PFC. Performance on incongruent blocks wasassociated with volume loss in supplementary motor areas, cingulate gyrus and aregion in medial PFC similar to that found for congruent blocks. Greatercoherence was found between frontal and occipital regions to the extentindividuals exhibited more bias. This suggests there are separable neuralcontributions to congruent and incongruent blocks of the IAT but there is also a surprising amount of overlap. Given the temporal and regional neuraldistinctions, these results provide converging evidence that stereotypicassociative strength assessed by the IAT indexes automatic processing to adegree.
 Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic condition characterized by an overlygregarious personality, including high empathetic concern for others. Althoughseemingly disparate from the profile of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), both are associated with deficits in social communication/cognition. Notably, the mirrorneuron system (MNS) has been implicated in social dysfunction for ASD; yet, theintegrity of this network and its association with social functioning in WSremains unknown. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods were used to examinethe structural integrity of the MNS of adults with WS versus typically developing(TD) individuals. The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), a tool typically used toscreen for social features of ASD, was also employed to assess the relationships between social functioning with the MNS morphology in WS participants. WSindividuals showed reduced cortical surface area of MNS substrates yet relativelypreserved cortical thickness as compared to TD adults. Increased corticalthickness of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) was associated with increaseddeficits in social communication, social awareness, social cognition, andautistic mannerisms. However, social motivation was not related to anatomicalfeatures of the MNS. Our findings indicate that social deficits typical to bothASD and WS may be attributed to an aberrant MNS, whereas the unusual social drivemarked in WS is subserved by substrates distinct from this network.
 Neuroticism is a fundamental personality trait associated with proneness to feel negative affect. Here we ask how Neuroticism influences the neural response topositive and negative social interactions and how Neuroticism modulates theeffect of intranasal oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) on the neural responseto social interactions. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 153 maleparticipants were randomized to receive 24 IU intranasal OT, 20 IU AVP orplacebo. Afterwards, they were imaged with fMRI while playing an iteratedPrisoner's Dilemma Game. On a different day, subjects completed the NEOpersonality inventory to measure Neuroticism. Neuroticism was positivelycorrelated with the neural response to negative social interactions in theanterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex and with the neural responseto positive social interactions in the insula, indicating that Neuroticismmodulates neuropsychological processing of both negative and positive socialinteractions. Neuroticism did not modulate the effect of intranasal OT treatment on the neural response to either positive or negative social interactions. On theother hand, AVP treatment significantly interacted with Neuroticism to modulatethe BOLD response to both positive and negative social interactions.Specifically, AVP increased anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortexand lateral temporal lobe responses to negative social interactions to a greater extent in participants scoring high rather than low on Neuroticism. AVP alsoincreased the insula response to positive social interactions to a greater extentin participants scoring high rather than low on Neuroticism. These results imply that AVP may increase emotion regulation in response to negative socialinteractions and the salience of positive social interactions to a greater extentin individuals high compared to low in Neuroticism. The current findings urgecaution against uniform clinical application of nonapeptides and suggest thattheir efficacy may vary as a function of personality.
 The neurological correlates of pointing comprehension in adults and 8-month-oldinfants are explored. Both age groups demonstrate differential activation tocongruent and incongruent pointing gestures over posterior temporal areas. Thefunctional similarity of the adult N200 and the infant P400 component suggeststhat they might have a common source.
 Compassion is a prototypical moral emotion supporting cooperation and involvesempathic decision-making and motor processes representing the interplay ofbiologically evolved and cultural mechanisms. We propose a social neuroscienceapproach to identify gender differences and to assess biological and culturalfactors shaping compassion. We consider the police force as a cultural model tostudy this emotion, because it comprises a mixed-gender group using specificcodes for collective safety that influence empathy and cooperativeness. From asample of Mexican police officers working in a violent environment we integrated ethnographic data categorizing compassionate elements in the officers'activities, psychometric measures evaluating empathic attitudes, and fMRI scansidentifying the brain activity related to compassionate experiences anddecisions. The results suggest that the police culture influences genders equallywith respect to empathic behavioral expressions. Nevertheless, women showedinsular and prefrontal cortical activation, suggesting a more empathic experienceof compassion. Officers manifested activity in the caudate nucleus, amygdala, andcerebellum, suggesting a more a highly accurate process to infer another'ssuffering and a reward system motivated by the notion of service and cooperation,both of which are cultural traits represented in the police force.
 Facial expressions play a critical role in social interactions by eliciting rapidresponses in the observer. Failure to perceive and experience a normal range and depth of emotion seriously impact interpersonal communication and relationships. As has been demonstrated across a number of domains, abnormal emotion processing in individuals with psychopathy plays a key role in their lack of empathy.However, the neuroimaging literature is unclear as to whether deficits arespecific to particular emotions such as fear and perhaps sadness. Moreover,findings are inconsistent across studies. In the current experiment, 80incarcerated adult males scoring high, medium, and low on the Hare PsychopathyChecklist-Revised (PCL-R) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning while viewing dynamic facial expressions of fear, sadness, happiness,and pain. Participants who scored high on the PCL-R showed a reduction inneuro-hemodynamic response to all four categories of facial expressions in theface processing network (inferior occipital gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and superiortemporal sulcus (STS)) as well as the extended network (inferior frontal gyrusand orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)), which supports a pervasive deficit acrossemotion domains. Unexpectedly, the response in dorsal insula to fear, sadness,and pain was greater in psychopaths than non-psychopaths. Importantly, theorbitofrontal cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), regionscritically implicated in affective and motivated behaviors, were significantlyless active in individuals with psychopathy during the perception of all fouremotional expressions.
 When we see others, we also try to 'see' their unobservable states of minds, suchas beliefs, desires, and intentions. We carefully monitor others' actions, as we assume that those actions are outward manifestations of their internal states.Actors and observers can have divergent views on the cause of the same actions.Critically, it is often the observers' view that affects important decisions insocial life, from deciding the optimal level of cooperation to judging moralresponsibility and court's decisions. Thus, the judgment about intentionality andagency in others' actions determines the way in which the observer deals with theactor. The primate brain has two separate neural systems that function inunderstanding others' actions and intentions. The mirror system is activated byothers' visible actions and predicts their physical consequences in goal terms,whereas the mentalizing system is primarily involved in the prediction of others'intentions and upcoming actions regardless of whether others' actions aredirectly observable or not. The functional roles of the two systems havesometimes been described as mutually independent or even oppositional. I propose a hypothesis that the two systems may collaborate closely for judging the senseof other-agency.
 The immediate early gene zenk encodes transcriptional regulators and is believed to be one of the first steps in the formation of long-term memories associatedwith a given stimulus. In this study, we investigated the expression of ZENKprotein product in brain regions that are likely involved in the processing ofsocial stimuli, such as a potential mate. Male pigeons (Columba livia) wereexposed to one of the following: (1) a live female pigeon, (2) a video playbackof a female pigeon, (3) a video playback of a female cockatoo, or (4) an emptystimulus chamber. The brains were then processed immunohistochemically using anantibody against ZENK protein. When the stimulus was a live pigeon compared toall other stimuli, there were more numerous and more darkly-stained ZENK-positivecells in three "association" regions of the telencephalon: the hyperpalliumapicale, the lateral portion of the intermediate nidopallium, and the medialnidopallium. There were no significant differences among the video-playbackstimuli. The results suggest that the level of ZENK expression in these"association" regions was influenced not only by the visual presence of apotential mate, but by the presence of non-visual signals, the quality of theimage, and the real-time interaction with the stimulus.
 Social disability represents a unifying feature in the diverse group ofindividuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Social neuroscience is the studyof brain mechanisms supporting interpersonal interaction. In this paper, wereview brain imaging studies of the social brain and highlight practicalapplications of these scientific insights. Understanding of social brainmechanisms holds promise as a tool for defining meaningful subgroups of children with ASD to facilitate genetic analyses and to inform treatment selection.Because social brain systems emerge in infancy, social neuroscience may help todetect atypical development before symptoms manifest. This conceptualization ofASD is a hopeful one, as social brain systems remain malleable well intodevelopment and are thus amenable to targeted intervention.
 We used magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained in same-sex and opposite-sexdizygotic twins (n = 119, 8 years of age) to study possible effects of prenatalandrogens on craniofacial features. Using a principal component analysis of 19craniofacial landmarks placed on the MR images, we identified a principalcomponent capturing craniofacial features that distinguished females with apresumed differential exposure to prenatal androgens by virtue of having a male(vs. a female) co-twin (Cohen's d = 0.76). Subsequently, we tested thepossibility that this craniofacial "signature" of prenatal exposure to androgens predicts brain size, a known sexually dimorphic trait. In an independent sampleof female adolescents (singletons; n = 462), we found that the facial signaturepredicts up to 8% of variance in brain size. These findings are consistent withthe organizational effects of androgens on brain development and suggest that thefacial signature derived in this study could complement other indirect measuresof prenatal exposure to androgens.
 Although a number of recent neuroimaging studies have examined the relationshipbetween the brain and deception, the neurological correlates of deception arestill not well understood. The present study sought to assess differences incortical excitability during the act of deception by measuring motor evokedpotentials (MEPs) during transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Sports fanaticsand low-affiliation sports fans were presented with preferred and rival teamimages and were asked to deceptively or honestly identify their favored team.Hemispheric differences were found including greater excitability of the leftmotor cortex during the generation of deceptive responses. In contrast to currentphysiological measures of deception, level of arousal was not found todifferentiate truthful and deceptive responses. The results are presented interms of a complex cognitive pattern contributing to the generation of deceptive responses.
 We provide the first high-temporal resolution account of the self-esteem implicitassociation test (IAT; Greenwald & Farnham, 2000) to highlight importantsimilarities and differences between the cognitive processes corresponding toimplicit valenced self-processing in high vs. low self-esteem individuals. Wedivided individuals into high and low self-esteem groups based on the Rosenbergself-esteem scale (Rosenberg, 1965) and administered the self-esteem IAT whilerecording electroencephalographic data. We show that the P2 captured group (high vs. low self-esteem) differences, the N250 and the late parietal positivity (LPP)captured differences corresponding to category pairing (self/positive vs.self/negative pairing), and the N1, P2, and P300-400 components capturedinteractions between self-esteem groups and whether the self was paired withpositive or negative categories in the IAT. Overall, both high and lowself-esteem groups were sensitive to the distinction between positive andnegative information in relation to the self (me/negative generally displayedlarger event-related potential amplitudes than me/positive), but for highself-esteem individuals, this difference was generally larger, earlier, and most pronounced over left-hemisphere electrodes. These electrophysiologicaldifferences may reflect differences in attentional resources devoted to teasingapart these two oppositely valenced associations. High self-esteem individualsappear to devote more automatic (early) attentional resources to strengthen thedistinction between positively or negatively valenced information in relation to the self.
 The problem of "voodoo" correlations-exceptionally high observed correlations in selected regions of the brain-is well recognized in neuroimaging. It arises when quantities of interest are estimated from the same data that was used to selectthem as interesting. In statistical terminology, the problem of inferencefollowing selection from the same data is that of selective inference. Motivated by the unwelcome side-effects of splitting the data- the recommended remedy-weadapt the recent developments in selective inference in order to constructconfidence intervals (CIs) with good reproducibility prospects, even if selectionand estimation are done with the same data. These intervals control the expected proportion of non-covered correlations in the selected voxels-the False Coverage Rate (FCR). They extend further toward zero than standard intervals, thusattenuating the impression made by highly biased observed correlations. They doso adaptively, in that they coincide with the standard CIs when far away from theselection point. We complement existing analytic proofs with a simulation,showing that the proposed intervals control the FCR in realistic socialneuroscience problems. We also suggest a "confidence calibration plot", to allow the intervals to be reported in a clear and interpretable way. Applying theproposed methodology on a loss-aversion study, we demonstrate that with thesample size and selection type employed, selection bias is considerable. Finally,selective intervals are compared to the currently recommended data-splittingapproach. We discover that our approach has more power and typically moreinformative, as no data is discarded. Computation of the intervals is implementedin an accompanying software package.
 Recent functional neuroimaging studies have shown that reflecting onrepresentations of the present self versus temporally distant selves isassociated with higher activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). In thecurrent fMRI study, we investigated whether this effect of temporal perspectiveis symmetrical between the past and future. The main results revealed that theMPFC showed higher activity when reflecting on the present self than whenreflecting on past and future selves, with no difference between past and future selves. Temporal perspective also modulated activity in the right inferiorparietal cortex but in the opposite direction, activity in this brain regionbeing higher when reflecting on past and future selves relative to the presentself (with again no difference between past and future selves). These findingsshow that differences in brain activity when thinking about current versustemporally distant selves are symmetrical between the past and the future. It is suggested that by processing degrees of self-relatedness, the MPFC might sustain the process of identifying oneself with current representations of the self,whereas the right inferior parietal cortex might be involved in distinguishingthe present self from temporally distant selves.
 Many studies provide support for the role of the fusiform gyrus in facerecognition and its sensitivity to emotional expressions. Recently,category-specific representation was also observed for neutral human bodies inthe middle temporal/middle occipital gyrus (extrastriate body area) but it is notclear whether this area is also sensitive to emotional bodily expressions.Besides these areas, other regions that process the affective information carriedby the face and the body may be common and/or specific to the face or the body.To clarify these issues we performed a systematic comparison of how the wholebrain processes faces and bodies and how their affective information isrepresented. Participants categorized emotional facial and bodily expressionswhile brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging.Our results show that, first, the amygdala and the fusiform gyrus are sensitiveto recognition of facial and bodily fear signals. Secondly, the extrastriate bodyarea-area V5/MT is specifically involved in processing bodies without beingsensitive to the emotion displayed. Thirdly, other important areas such as thesuperior temporal sulcus, the parietal lobe and subcortical structures represent selectively facial and bodily expressions. Finally, some face/body differences inactivation are a function of the emotion expressed.
 Although we fundamentally agree with Schilbach et al., we argue here that thereis still some residual utility for non-interactive scenarios in socialneuroscience. They may be useful to quantify individual differences in prosocial inclination that are not influenced by concerns about reputation or socialpressure.
 Social comparison pervades our interactions with others, informing us of ourstanding and motivating improvement, but producing negative emotional andbehavioral consequences that can harm relationships and lead to poor healthoutcomes. Social neuroscience research has begun to illuminate some mechanisms bywhich status divides lead to interpersonal consequences. This review integratescore findings on the neuroscience of social comparison processes, showing theeffects of comparing the self to relevant others on dimensions of competence and warmth. The literature converges to suggest that relative status divides initiatesocial comparison processes, that upward and downward comparisons initiate pain- and pleasure-related neural responses, and that these responses can predictpeoples kindly or aggressive intentions toward one another. Across differenttypes of comparisons, brain regions involved in mentalizing are also sometimesinvolved. Along with future work, the research reviewed here may inform effortsto mitigate negative outcomes of constant social comparisons.
 Research on familiar face recognition has largely focused on the neuralcorrelates of recognizing a beloved partner or family member. However, noresearch has explored the effect of marriage style on the recognition of abeloved partner's face, especially in matriarchal societies. Here, we examinedthe time course of event-related potentials (ERP) in response to the face of abeloved partner, sibling, or unknown person in a sample of individuals from thematriarchal Mosuo tribe. Two groups were assessed: intermarriage and walkingmarriage groups (i.e., couples in a committed relationship who do not cohabitate during the daytime). In agreement with previous reports, ERP results revealedmore positive VPP, N250, and P300 waveforms for beloved faces than sibling faces in both groups. Moreover, P300 was more positive for beloved partner versussibling faces; however, this difference emerged at fronto-central sites for thewalking marriage group and at posterior sites for the intermarriage group.Overall, we observed that marriage style affects the later stage processing of a beloved partner's face, and this may be associated with greater affective arousaland familiarity.
 Social cognitive difficulties are common in the acute phase of bipolar disorderand, to a lesser extent, during the euthymic stage, and imaging studies of socialcognition in euthymic bipolar disorder have implicated mirror system brainregions. This study aimed to use a novel multimodal approach (i.e., includingboth transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalogram (EEG)) toinvestigate mirror systems in bipolar disorder. Fifteen individuals with euthymicbipolar disorder and 16 healthy controls participated in this study. Single-pulseTMS was applied to the optimal site in the primary motor cortex (M1), whichstimulates the muscle of interest during the observation of hand movements(goal-directed or interacting) designed to elicit mirror system activity. Single EEG electrodes (C3, CZ, C4) recorded mu rhythm modulation concurrently. Resultsrevealed that the patient group showed significantly less mu suppression comparedto healthy controls. Surprisingly, motor resonance was not significantlydifferent overall between groups; however, bipolar disorder participants showed apattern of reduced reactivity on some conditions. Although preliminary, thisstudy indicates a potential mirror system deficit in euthymic bipolar disorder,which may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disorder.
 Time perception is an essential part of our everyday lives, in both theprospective and the retrospective domains. However, our knowledge of temporalprocessing is mainly limited to the networks responsible for comparing ormaintaining specific intervals or frequencies. In the presented fMRI study, wesought to characterize the neural nodes engaged specifically in predictivetemporal analysis, the estimation of the future position of an object withvarying movement parameters, and the contingent neuroanatomical signature ofdifferences in behavioral performance between genders. The established dominantcerebellar engagement offers novel evidence in favor of a pivotal role of thisstructure in predictive short-term timing, overshadowing the basal gangliareported together with the frontal cortex as dominant in retrospective temporalprocessing in the subsecond spectrum. Furthermore, we discovered lowerperformance in this task and massively increased cerebellar activity in womencompared to men, indicative of strategy differences between the genders. Thispromotes the view that predictive temporal computing utilizes comparablestructures in the retrospective timing processes, but with a definite dominanceof the cerebellum.
 From an evolutionary perspective, one should be more sensitive when outgroupmembers attack the ingroup but less so when ingroup or outgroup members fightamong themselves. Indeed, previous behavioral and neuroimaging researchdemonstrated that people show greater sensitivity for the suffering of ingroupcompared with outgroup members. However, the question still remains whether this is always the case regardless of who is the agent causing the harm. To examinethe role of agency and group membership in perception of harm, 48 participantswere scanned while viewing ingroup or outgroup perpetrators intentionally harmingingroup or outgroup members. Behavioral results showed greater moral sensitivity for ingroup versus outgroup victims, but only when the perpetrator was from theoutgroup. In support of this finding, fMRI data showed greater activity in leftorbitofrontal cortex (OFC) for ingroup victims when they were harmed by outgroup individuals. In addition, effective connectivity analyses documented an increasedcoupling between left OFC and left amygdala and insula for ingroup harm, when theperpetrator was from the outgroup. Together these results indicate that we arehighly sensitive to harm perpetrated by outgroup members and that increasedsensitivity for ingroup victims is dependent on who is the agent of the action.
 Males have been suggested to have advantages over females in reactions to childfacial resemblance, which reflects the evolutionary pressure on males to solvethe adaptive paternal uncertainty problem and to identify biological offspring.However, previous studies showed inconsistent results and the male advantage inchild facial resemblance perception, as a kin detection mechanism, is stillunclear. Here, we investigated the behavioral and brain mechanisms underlying theself-resembling faces processing and how it interacts with sex and age usingevent-related potential (ERP) technique. The results showed a stable maleadvantage in self-resembling child faces processing, such that males have higher detectability to self-resembling child faces than females. For ERP results, malesshowed smaller N2 and larger late positive component (LPC) amplitudes forself-resembling child faces, which may reflect face-matching and self-referentialprocessing in kin detection, respectively. Further source analysis showed thatthe N2 component and LPC were originated from the anterior cingulate cortex andmedial frontal gyrus, respectively. Our results support the male advantage inself-resembling child detection and further indicate that such distinctions canbe found in both early and late processing stages in the brain at differentregions.
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a serious condition with a major negative impact onpatient's physical and mental health. Postural instability is one of the cardinaldifficulties reported by patients to deal with. Neuroanatomical, animal, andclinical studies on nonparkinsonian and parkinsonian subjects suggest animportant correlation between the presence of balance dysfunction and multiplemood disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and apathy. Considering that balancedysfunction is a very common symptom in PD, we can presume that by its managementwe could positively influence patient's state of mind too. This review is ananalysis of nonpharmacological methods shown to be effective and successful forimproving balance in patients suffering from PD. Strategies such as generalexercise, robotic assisted training, Tai Chi, Qi Gong, Yoga, dance (such as tangoor ballet), box, virtual reality-based, or neurofeedback-based techniques and so forth can significantly improve the stability in these patients. Beside thisphysical outcome, many methods have also shown effect on quality of life,depression level, enjoyment, and motivation to continue in practicing the method independently. The purpose of this review is to provide information aboutpractical and creative methods designed to improve balance in PD and highlighttheir positive impact on patient's psychology.
 Lateralized magnetic fields were recorded from 12 subjects using a 151 channelmagnetoencephalography (MEG) system to investigate temporal and functionalproperties of motor activation to the observation of goal-directed hand movementsby a virtual actor. Observation of left and right hand movements generated aneuromagnetic lateralized readiness field (LRF) over contralateral motor cortex. The early onset of the LRF and the fact that the evoked component was insensitiveto the correctness of the observed action suggest the operation of a fast andautomatic form of motor resonance that may precede higher levels of actionunderstanding.
 Research into moral decision-making has been dominated by sacrificial dilemmaswhere, in order to save several lives, it is necessary to sacrifice the life ofanother person. It is widely assumed that these dilemmas draw a sharp contrastbetween utilitarian and deontological approaches to morality, and thereby enable us to study the psychological and neural basis of utilitarian judgment. However, it has been previously shown that some sacrificial dilemmas fail to present agenuine contrast between utilitarian and deontological options. Here, I raisedeeper problems for this research paradigm. Even when sacrificial dilemmaspresent a contrast between utilitarian and deontological options at aphilosophical level, it is misleading to interpret the responses of ordinary folkin these terms. What is currently classified as "utilitarian judgment" does notin fact share essential features of a genuine utilitarian outlook, and is better explained in terms of commonsensical moral notions. When subjects deliberateabout such dilemmas, they are not deciding between opposing utilitarian anddeontological solutions, but engaging in a richer process of weighing opposingmoral reasons. Sacrificial dilemmas therefore tell us little about utilitariandecision-making. An alternative approach to studying proto-utilitarian tendenciesin everyday moral thinking is proposed.
 Impulsivity, which is linked to a wide range of psychiatric disorders, is oftencharacterized by a preference for immediate but smaller rewards over delayed but larger rewards. However, debate exists on the relationship between anxiety andimpulsivity. Here we use event-related potential (ERP) components as biomarkersin the temporal discounting task to examine the effect of anxiety oninter-temporal decision-making. Our behavioral results indicated that the hightrait anxiety (HTA) group made significantly more immediate choices than the low trait anxiety (LTA) group. Compared with the LTA group, shorter response time wasassociated with immediate rewards in the HTA group. Furthermore, previous studieshave demonstrated three ERP components that are associated with impulsivityand/or delay discounting. First, the N1 is an early sensory component involved inselective attention and attention processing for goal-directed actions. Second,the reward positivity (RewP) reflects reward-related dopaminergic activity andencodes reward values. Third, the P3 is regarded as a measure of motivationalsignificance in the decision-making literature. Accordingly, this study found in the immediate-option-evoked ERPs that the HTA group had a larger N1 than the LTA group did. For the delayed-option-evoked ERPs, the HTA group had larger N1 andRewP for the immediate choice than the LTA group did, while the LTA group had alarger P3 for the delayed choice than the HTA group did. These results supportthe notion that anxiety individuals are impulsive decision-makers in the DelayDiscounting Task.
 Although neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is classically recognized as an affectationof optic nerves and spinal cord, recent reports have shown brain atrophy andcognitive dysfunction in this condition. Importantly, emotion-related brainregions appear to be impaired in NMO. However, no studies of NMO' emotionalprocessing have been published. The goal of the current study was to investigate facial emotion recognition in 10 patients with NMO and 10 healthy controls bycontrolling for relevant cognitive factors. Consistent with previous reports, NMOpatients performed poorly across cognitive domains (divided attention, workingmemory, and information-processing speed). Our findings further evidence therelative inability of NMO patients to recognize negative emotions (disgust,anger, and fear), in comparison to controls, with these deficits not explained byother cognitive impairments. Results provide the first evidence that NMO mayimpair the ability to recognize negative emotions. These impairments appear to berelated to possible damage in brain regions underling emotional networks,including the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex. Findings increased both our understanding of NMO's cognitive impairment, and the neural networks underlying negative emotions.
 Social neuroscience studies have shown that the ventral striatum (VS), a highlyreward-sensitive brain area, is activated when participants win competitivetasks. However, in these settings winning often entails both avoiding punishment and punishing the opponent. It is thus unclear whether the rewarding propertiesof winning are mainly associated to punishment avoidance, or if punishing theopponent can be additionally gratifying. In the present paper we explored theneurophysiological correlates of each outcome, aiming to better understand thedevelopment of aggression episodes. We previously introduced a competitivereaction time task that separates both effects: in half of the won trials,participants can physically punish their opponent (active trials), whereas in theother half they can only avoid a punishment (passive trials). We performedfunctional connectivity analysis seeded in the VS to test for differentialnetwork interactions in active compared to passive trials. The VS showed greater connectivity with areas involved in reward valuation (orbitofrontal cortex),arousal (dorsal thalamus and posterior insula), attention (inferior occipitalgyrus), and motor control (supplementary motor area) in active compared topassive trials, whereas connectivity between the VS and the inferior frontalgyrus decreased. Interindividual variability in connectivity strength between VS and posterior insula was related to aggressive behavior, whereas connectivitybetween VS and supplementary motor area was related to faster reaction times inactive trials. Our results suggest that punishing a provoking opponent whenwinning might adaptively favor a "competitive state" in the course of anaggressive interaction.
 Clinical encounters with patients are a form of social engagement. A critical andimplicit component of meaningful engagement with patients is eye contact.Researchers in the rapidly growing, multidisciplinary field of socialneuroscience have discovered a great deal about this "first-contact" aspect ofhuman relating that is of direct and practical relevance to the practicingclinician. Findings reviewed in this article include aspects of the neurobiology of social attention, the role of certain neurochemicals (eg, serotonin, oxytocin)in eye contact, and the diagnostic importance of eye contact and gaze in various diagnostic entities. Clinically, these findings underscore the important role of eye contact in 1) establishing meaningful rapport; 2) supplying implicitinformation about a patient's emotional state; 3) providing diagnostic clues tocommon psychiatric disorders; 4) delivering impactful clinical messages; and 5)provisioning hope and embodied empathy. Current neuroscience research in thisarea highlights why mindful attention to this facet of social engagement is part of the repertoire of an effective, empathic clinician.
 Reward processing plays a major role in goal-directed behavior and motivation. Onthe neural level, it is mediated by a complex network of brain structures called the dopaminergic reward system. In the last decade, neuroscientific researchershave become increasingly interested in aspects of social interaction that areexperienced as rewarding. Recent neuroimaging studies have provided evidence thatthe reward system mediates the processing of social stimuli in a manner analogousto nonsocial rewards and thus motivates social behavior. In this context, theneuropeptide oxytocin is assumed to play a key role by activating dopaminergicreward pathways in response to social cues, inducing the rewarding quality ofsocial interactions. Alterations in the dopaminergic reward system have beenfound in several psychiatric disorders that are accompanied by social interactionand motivation problems, for example autism, attention deficit/hyperactivitydisorder, addiction disorders, and schizophrenia.
 Social connections are essential for the survival of a social species likehumans. People differ in the degree to which they are sensitive to perceiveddeficits in their social connections, but evidence suggests that theynevertheless construe the nature of their social connections similarly. Thisconstrual can be thought of as a mental representation of a multi-faceted social experience. A three-dimensional mental representation has been identified withthe UCLA Loneliness Scale and consists of Intimate, Relational, and CollectiveConnectedness reflecting beliefs about one's individual, dyadic, and collective(group) social value, respectively. Moreover, this mental representation has beenreplicated with other scales and validated across age, gender, and racial/ethnic lines in U.S. samples. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the extent towhich this three-dimensional representation applies to people whose social lives are experienced in a collectivistic rather than individualistic culture. To that end, we used confirmatory factor analyses to assess the fit of thethree-dimensional mental structure to data collected from Chinese people livingin China. Two hundred sixty-seven young adults (16-25 yrs) and 250 older adults(50-65 yrs) in Beijing completed the revised UCLA Loneliness Scale anddemographic and social activity questionnaires. Results revealed adequate fit of the structure to data from young and older Chinese adults. Moreover, thestructure exhibited equivalent fit in young and older Chinese adults despitechanges in the Chinese culture that exposed these two generations to differentcultural experiences. Social activity variables that discriminated among thethree dimensions in the Chinese samples corresponded well with variables thatdiscriminated among the three dimensions in the U.S.-based samples, indicatingcultural commonalities in the factors predicting dimensions of people'srepresentations of their social connections. Equivalence of the three-dimensionalstructure is relevant for an understanding of cultural differences in the sourcesof loneliness and social connectedness.
 Deja vu (DV) is an eerie phenomenon experienced frequently as an aura of temporallobe epilepsy, but also reported commonly by healthy individuals. The formerpathological manifestation appears to result from aberrant neural activity among brain structures within the medial temporal lobes. Recent studies also implicate medial temporal brain structures in the non-pathological experience of DV, but asone element of a diffuse neuroanatomical correlate; it remains to be seen ifneural activity among the medial temporal lobes also underlies this benignmanifestation. The present study set out to investigate this. Due to itsunpredictable and infrequent occurrence, however, non-pathological DV does notlend itself easily to functional neuroimaging. Instead, we draw on researchshowing that brain structure covaries among regions that interact frequently asnodes of functional networks. Specifically, we assessed whether grey-mattercovariance among structures implicated in non-pathological DV differs accordingto the frequency with which the phenomenon is experienced. This revealed twodiverging patterns of structural covariation: Among the first, comprisedprimarily of medial temporal structures and the caudate, grey-matter volumebecomes more positively correlated with higher frequency of DV experience. Thesecond pattern encompasses medial and lateral temporal structures, among whichgreater DV frequency is associated with more negatively correlated grey matter.Using a meta-analytic method of co-activation mapping, we demonstrate a higherprobability of functional interactions among brain structures constituting theformer pattern, particularly during memory-related processes. Our findingssuggest that altered neural signalling within memory-related medial temporalbrain structures underlies both pathological and non-pathological DV.
 The recognition of emotional expressions is an important skill and relates tosocial functioning and adjustment in childhood. The current functional MRI study investigated the neural processing of angry and happy facial expressions in 5- to6-year-old children and in adults. Participants were presented happy and angryfaces of adults and children while they performed a non-emotion-related task withlow cognitive load. Very similar neural networks were involved in the processing of angry and happy faces in adults and children, including the amygdala andprefrontal areas. In general, children showed heightened amygdala activation inresponse to emotional faces relative to adults. While children showed strongeramygdala activation in response to angry adult compared to angry child faces,adults showed stronger amygdala activation for angry child faces. In both agegroups enhanced amygdala involvement was found for happy peer faces relative tohappy non-peer faces, though this effect was only a tendency in adults. Thefindings are discussed in the context of the development of the social brainnetwork.
 There is strong evidence that empathy has deep evolutionary, biochemical, andneurological underpinnings. Even the most advanced forms of empathy in humans arebuilt on more basic forms and remain connected to core mechanisms associated withaffective communication, social attachment, and parental care. Socialneuroscience has begun to examine the neurobiological mechanisms that instantiateempathy, especially in response to signals of distress and pain, and how certain dispositional and contextual moderators modulate its experience. Functionalneuroimaging studies document a circuit that responds to the perception ofothers' distress. Activation of this circuit reflects an aversive response in theobserver, and this information may act as a trigger to inhibit aggression orprompt motivation to help. Moreover, empathy in humans is assisted by otherdomain-general high-level cognitive abilities, such as executive functions,mentalizing, and language, which expand the range of behaviors that can be drivenby empathy.
 Although recent fMRI studies on humor have begun to elucidate cognitive andaffective neural correlates, they weren't able to distinguish between differentlogical mechanisms or steps of humor processing, i.e., the detection of anincongruity and its resolution. This fMRI study aimed to focus in more detail on cognitive humor processing. In order to investigate pure incongruity resolutionwithout preprocessing steps, nonverbal cartoons differing in their logicalmechanisms were contrasted with nonhumorous pictures containing an irresolvableincongruity. The logical mechanisms were: (1) visual puns (visual resemblance,PUNs); (2) semantic cartoons (pure semantic relationships, SEMs); and (3) Theory of Mind cartoons (which require additionally mentalizing abilities, TOMs). Thirtycartoons from each condition were presented to 17 healthy subjects whileacquiring fMR images. The results reveal a left-sided network involved in pureincongruity resolution: e.g., temporo-parietal junction, inferior frontal gyrusand ventromedian prefrontal cortex. These areas are also involved in processingof SEMs, whereas PUNs show more activation in the extrastriate cortex and TOMsshow more activation in so-called mentalizing areas. Processing of picturescontaining an irresolvable incongruity evokes activation in the rostral cingulatezone, which might reflect error processing. We conclude that cognitive processingof different logical mechanisms depends on separate neural networks.
 Psychological stress is a major risk factor for the development and progressionof a number of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, arthritis, andmajor depression. A growing body of research suggests that long-term,stress-induced activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and thehypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may lead to increases in inflammation, which is known to play a key role in the pathophysiology of a variety ofdiseases. Furthermore, the burgeoning fields of social neuroscience and healthneuroscience have begun to identify the neurocognitive mechanisms by which stressmay lead to these physiological changes. Here we review the literature examining the neurocognitive correlates of stress-induced SNS, HPA, and inflammatoryresponses. Specifically, we summarize the results of neuroimaging studies thathave examined the neural correlates of stress-related increases in SNS, HPA, and inflammatory activity. A set of neural systems involved in threat processing,safety processing, and social cognition are suggested as key contributors tostress-related changes in physiology. We conclude by offering suggestions forfuture research in the exciting new field of health neuroscience.
 Previous correlational imaging studies have implicated the dorsolateralprefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in decision making. Using High-Definition Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD-tDCS), the present study directly investigated thecausal role of the DLPFC in performing the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and theInter-Temporal Choice (ITC) task. Three experiments were conducted: Experiment 1 (N = 41) to study the left DLPFC, Experiment 2 (N = 49) to study the right DLPFC,and Experiment 3 (N = 20, a subset of those in Experiment 1) to switch theexperimental and control conditions. All participants were healthy male collegestudents. For Experiments 1 and 2, participants were randomly assigned to either the HD-tDCS or the sham stimulation condition. For Experiment 3, participantswere assigned to the condition they were not in during Experiment 1. Resultsshowed that HD-tDCS over the left DLPFC increased IGT score, decreased therecency parameter in IGT, and lowered delay discounting rate (k) in the ITC task.We discussed the potential roles of impulse control and time perception inmediating the effect of tDCS stimulation of left DLPFC on decision making. Ourresults have clinical implications for the treatment of disorders involving poor decision-making, such as addictions.
 Studies investigating the effects of violent computer and video game playing haveresulted in heterogeneous outcomes. It has been assumed that there is a decreasedability to differentiate between virtuality and reality in people that play thesegames intensively. FMRI data of a group of young males with (gamers) and without (controls) a history of long-term violent computer game playing experience wereobtained during the presentation of computer game and realistic video sequences. In gamers the processing of real violence in contrast to nonviolence producedactivation clusters in right inferior frontal, left lingual and superior temporalbrain regions. Virtual violence activated a network comprising bilateral inferiorfrontal, occipital, postcentral, right middle temporal, and left fusiformregions. Control participants showed extended left frontal, insula and superiorfrontal activations during the processing of real, and posterior activationsduring the processing of virtual violent scenarios. The data suggest that theability to differentiate automatically between real and virtual violence has not been diminished by a long-term history of violent video game play, nor havegamers' neural responses to real violence in particular been subject todesensitization processes. However, analyses of individual data indicated thatgroup-related analyses reflect only a small part of actual individual differentneural network involvement, suggesting that the consideration of individuallearning history is sufficient for the present discussion.
 The present research examined how positive and negative moods affect readers'understanding of positive and negative story endings. It demonstrated hownegativity bias and mood congruence emerge during narrative comprehension.Participants were induced to experience either a positive or a negative mood and then read stories that could have either a positive or a negative ending. InExperiment 1, participants took longer to integrate negative endings thanpositive endings, independent of their mood. In Experiment 2, participants judgedas more surprising those endings that did not match their mood. The presentresults illustrate that ending valence has strong influence on moment-by-momentreading, but that readers' moods influence expectations for story outcomes oncereaders reflect on a complete representation of the story.
